The smoldering garden of the title is Hawaii, where the golf- starved Japanese who have come to purchase billionaire Byron Trumbo's sprawling resort are as likely to discover severed hands on the 14th green as they are to encounter a giant talking pig that devours souls. Historian Eleanor Perry has a different motive for her visit--to solve the mystery of her Great Great Great Great Aunt Kidder, whose Hawaiian adventures with Mark Twain in 1866 will be paralleled by Perry's own. In each era, a grumpy cabal of local priests summons the forces of darkness to rid the islands of an unwanted white plague--missionaries in Aunt Kidder's day, real- estate tycoons in Perry's. Shifting deftly between the mid-1800s and the present, Simmons uses Aunt Kidder's journal to recount her unlikely romantic gambol with Samuel Clemens, not yet Mark Twain but acid-tongued nonetheless. The pair's climactic scene together, in which Kidder and Clemens slather themselves with rotten kukui- nut oil and descend naked into the underworld, approaches inspired hilarity without compromising suspense. Never really too cloying in its symmetries, the novel supplies Perry with her own confederates, who, while not possessed of Clemens's legendary wit, are substantially more than cardboard action figures. In a useful twist, it's Cordie Stumpf, Perry's hard-drinking sister in arms, who, with a reluctant Trumbo as her Twain, battles the novel's pig- god Mephistopheles to reclaim Perry's captured ghost and save the imperiled resort. Allying the women, literally, with female volcanic deities, Simmons even wedges a feminist angle into his already bulging anthropological primer. The flip side of a Don Ho single, short on poi and ukuleles but long on elemental carnage, vengeful immortals, and nimble plotting. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>A talking hog with a bad attitude and a hungry humanoid with a shark's mouth in his hunchback are but two of the many loopy touches that Simmons (Lovedeath) puts into this fractured horror novel. There's also an unusual dual narration: a third-person account of the occult revenge wreaked on a ritzy but politically incorrect Hawaiian resort, and a first-person chronicle, drawn from a 19th-century diary, of similar troubles witnessed by the diarist, Lorena Stewart, and her traveling companion, the young Mark Twain. For all its eccentricities, though, the book is unlikely to add to Simmons's clutch of awards (Hugo, Bram Stoker, World Fantasy, etc.), because at heart it's powered by an utterly conventional horror premise-that nature will bite back when bitten-and because its dominant, present-time plot is peopled by cartoonish types. Chief among these is Byron Trumbo, the Trump-like tycoon who has so offended Hawaiian islanders with his sprawling resort carved into wilderness terrain that some have called upon ancient Hawaiian gods (hog and co.) and the giant volcanoes they control to destroy the resort. Simmons generates moderate suspense as Stewart's descendant and others race to save lives and souls from erupting volcanoes and malevolent gods, but not enough to avoid the reader's feeling that he should have shoehorned the entire story into the Twain segments, whose deft period charms more aptly suit the antiquated themes, characters and pyrotechnics on display.

Now these three women have the means, the opportunity, and the perfect motive. Are they trying to get away with murder--or is someone trying to make sure that this time they don&#x2019;t get away at all? <b>The Survivors Club</b>. . .that&#x2019;s what Jillian Hayes, Carol Rosen, and Meg Pesaturo call it. They won&#x2019;t consider themselves victims. They are survivors. They faced the blazing headlines and helped lead the investigation that caught the man who changed their lives forever. <br><br>And now that Eddie Como, the College Hill rapist, has been murdered, shot down outside a packed courthouse moments before his trial was about to begin, all three women are openly ecstatic that he&#x2019;s dead. They are also the prime suspects in his murder. Detective Sergeant Roan Griffin knows all too well what can drive even the best people to cross the line. But he has never seen a case quite like this one. No one doubts that the murder of Eddie Como was a professional job, especially when the gunman is killed only blocks away from the shooting. <br><br>But questions taunt Griffin: Who ordered the deaths of Eddie Como and his killer? Could three ordinary women have been driven to do he unthinkable? Had someone in the Survivors Club become a killer? Griffin seeks the truth--and finds himself confronted with the leader of the Survivors Club. Jillian Hayes is beautiful, successful, cool as ice, and she harbors a pain that mirrors Griffin&#x2019;s own. Did the horror of what happened to her push her over the thin and desperate line that separates survival and revenge? And if it did, could he blame her--or anyone in the Survivors Club? Then another woman is brutally attacked. <br><br>Suddenly, with the city on the ragged edge of panic, gripped in a media and political firestorm of controversy, cover-up, and conspiracy, the hunt is on for a ruthless and cunning killer. For Griffin, this may well be the case that shatters his career. For Jillian, the harrowing nightmare is beginning all over again. Someone is out there. Someone who wants to finish what was started. Someone who wants to make sure that no one survives the Survivors Club.</p><p>Praise for the novels of Lisa Gardner<br><br><b>The Survivors Club</b><br>"Lisa Gardner's THE SURVIVORS CLUB is a high-octane, nerve-jangling tale of suspense.&#x201d;<br>-- Harlan Coben, bestselling author of <b>Tell No One and<i> </i>Gone for Good</b><br><br>"<b>The Survivors Club</b><i> </i>has it all -- provocative plotting, an astute eye for detail, engaging characters, and a razor-sharp emotional edge."<br>-&#x2013;Stephen White, bestselling author of <b>Warning Signs</b><br><br><b>The Next Accident<br></b>&#x201c;A suspense-laden, twist-filled tale that easily equals the best of Sue Grafton and Kathy Reichs.&#x201d; <br>-<i>The Providence Sunday Journal<br><br></i><b>The Third Victim<br></b>&#x201c;A suspenseful, curl-up winter read, this thriller <br>teems with crisp, realistic dialogue and engaging characters.&#x201d; <br>-<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)<br><br></i><b>The Other Daughter<br></b>&#x201c;Sheer terror...a great read.&#x201d; <br>-Iris Johansen<br><br><b>The Perfect Husband<br></b>&#x201c;A streamlined, bang-up addition to the oeuvre of Tami Hoag, Karen Robards, Elizabeth Powell and, these days, even Nora Roberts.&#x201d; <br><i>-Publishers Weekly<br></i><br><i>From the Audio Cassette edition.</i>Lisa Gardner is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <b>The Next Accident, The Other Daughter, The Third Victim</b>, and <b>The Perfect Husband</b>.

Roosevelt was born into one of the wealthiest families in America, yet this ultimate rich kid grew up to do more for ordinary Americans than any other president. This appealing picture book biography shows how, from childhood on, FDR&nbsp; was compassionate, cheerful, determined, and enormously likable.

A summary of his achievements as president and a chronology of his life are included.

Krull tells readers, &#34;He had long blond curls and wore dresses with fancy lace collars till he was almost six.&#34; His parents indulged his every wish and were quick to forgive any mischief, yet instilled a social conscience in their golden boy from an early age, urging him to &#34;Help the helpless!&#34; After a sheltered childhood of homeschooling, Franklin left for boarding school at age 14. Despite his parents&#39; plans for him to be a gentleman like his father, he was inspired to enter the world of politics by the headmaster at Groton; his cousin Teddy; and his future wife, Eleanor. Stricken with polio at 39, Franklin struggled to regain his strength, reentering the political arena three years later. An epilogue explains the stock market crash, Great Depression, New Deal, fireside chats, and World War II. Filled with anecdotes and quotes, the text is concise and engaging, working well as a read-aloud or for independent reading. The rich, impressionistic oil and ink illustrations capture the spirit of the man and his time. Less wordy and more attractive than Judith St. George and Britt Spencer&#39;s Make Your Mark, Franklin Roosevelt (Philomel. 2007), this offering also covers more of the subject&#39;s life.

In this highly lucid guide to the dynamics of modern biology, Isaac Asimov deftly explores the most recent discoveries in this constantly surprising field of inquiry. In the first part, he explains the mechanics of the inanimate world, the significance of energy, work, motion, heat, and chemical reaction. He then uses these concepts in the second half to analyze and explain the latest advances in the study of enzymes, amino acids, proteins and the very processes which constitute life itself. In short, Dr. Asimov&#39;s keen examination of biology&#39;s current desire to isolate and control the very basis of life--the significance of which promises to revolutionize life itself--becomes a fascinating as well as informative excursion.

Yeats&#39;s first major collection of poetry as Nobel Laureate after the receiving the Nobel Prize in 1923. It is considered to be one of his most influential collections. The title refers to Thoor Ballylee Castle, a Norman tower that Yeats purchased in 1917 and later restored. The Tower includes some of his greatest and most innovative poems including &#39;Sailing to Byzantium&#39;, a lyrical meditation on man&#39;s disillusionment with the physical world; &#39;Leda and the Swan&#39;, a violent and graphic take on the Greek myth of Leda and Zeus and &#39;Among School Children&#39;, a poetic contemplation of life, love and the creative process.</p><p>W. B. Yeats (1865-1939) was one of the greatest and most innovative poets of the twentieth century, and a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival. Much of his most vigorous verse on love, sex, Irish and international politics, the complexities of the occult and the &#39;sedentary toil&#39; of poetry was produced in the years between his fiftieth birthday in 1915 and his death in 1939. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>A last-minute shopper entering a London bookstore on Valentine's Day in 1928 with six shillings to spend on a gift for his or her beloved could hardly have made a better investment -- either poetically or financially -- than one of the 2,000 copies of a volume Macmillan &amp; Co. had published that morning: <i>The Tower</i> by W. B. Yeats. Twenty-one poems in 104 pages; six pages of notes; olive green cloth with a design by T. Sturge Moore stamped in gold on front and spine, also reproduced on the dust jacket. No illustrations, no book club dividends: simply one of the seminal volumes of Modern Poetry, indeed of poetry in English as we know it. Doubtless not every lyric is a masterpiece, but how often have we been given between two covers such "monuments of magnificence" as "Sailing to Byzantium," "Leda and the Swan," and "Among School Children" -- not to mention "The Tower," "Meditations in Time of Civil War," "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," or "Two Songs from a Play"? "A thing never known again," indeed.<br><br>The gestation of <i>The Tower</i> was a long process. A draft of "The New Faces" was sent to Lady Gregory on 7 December 1912; a draft of "From 'Oedipus at Colonus'" was sent to Olivia Shakespear on 13 March 1927. Yeats began to publish the poems that would form <i>The Tower</i> in journals as early as March 1921 and in book form the following year: <i>Seven Poems and a Fragment</i>, an edition of only 500 copies by the Cuala Press, the private press run by his sisters. Two more Cuala Press volumes would follow -- <i>The Cat and the Moon and Certain Poems</i> (1924), again in a printing of only 500 copies; and <i>October Blast</i> (1927), one of the rarest of all Cuala publications, only 350 copies. The single poem in <i>The Tower</i> not previously published would be "Colonus' Praise." Finally, on 16 September 1927, Yeats submitted copy for the volume to Macmillan:<br><br>I send you...the manuscript of 'The Tower.' Feeling that it was exaggerated in certain directions I continually put off sending it, but I cannot delay any longer. If, when you have received the Manuscript, you think the book too small, or have any fault to find, please delay it for a few months.<br><br>Yeats went on to explain that he was writing a series of poems for a limited American edition (<i>The Winding Stair</i>, 1929) and that these could be added to <i>The Tower</i> in a year. Seldom has a Nobel Laureate been quite so diffident about his latest work.<br><br>Although the Cuala Press <i>Michael Robartes and the Dancer</i> (1921) had been included in <i>Later Poems</i> (1922), Macmillan had not published a major new volume of Yeats's poetry since <i>The Wild Swans at Coole</i> (1919). It is thus not surprising that the publisher gave little heed to Yeats's reservations about <i>The Tower</i> and instead put the book into production, with publication on 14 February 1928. The volume quickly sold out, and a second impression was issued in March. In July 1929 Macmillan published a third impression with some corrections. An edition by Macmillan, New York, appeared on 22 May 1928, with a second impression in January 1929.<br><br>As usual, Yeats treated <i>The Tower</i> as a unique work, not simply a collection of poems. The order of the poems was anything but chronological, either in terms of composition or of the events depicted. For instance, the second poem written and the first published, "All Souls' Night," was placed last. "Meditations in Time of Civil War," describing the violence in Ireland of 1922-23, precedes "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen." A poem that concludes with the story of Christ, "Two Songs from a Play," is followed by one that describes the union of Leda and Zeus.<br><br>Yeats's interest in <i>The Tower</i> as a separate work of art extended to the physical book itself. Once the arrangements for the volume had been made with Macmillan, he enlisted his friend T. Sturge Moore, a writer and artist, to undertake the design, writing him on 23 May 1927:<br><br>I want you to design the cover -- design in gold -- and a frontispiece. The book is to be called <i>The Tower</i>, as a number of the poems were written at and about Ballylee Castle. The frontispiece I want is a drawing of the castle, something of the nature of a woodcut. If you consent I will send you a bundle of photographs. It is a most impressive building and what I want is an imaginative impression. Do what you like with cloud and bird, day and night, but leave the great walls as they are.<br><br>Moore immediately agreed. Yeats sent him some poems and photographs and made the further suggestion that "the Tower should not be too unlike the real object, or rather that it should suggest the real object. I like to think of that building as a permanent symbol of my work plainly visible to the passer-by. As you know, all my art theories depend upon just this -- rooting of mythology in the earth" (<i>LTSM</i> 114). Yeats approved of Moore's design of the Tower reflected in the adjacent stream, telling him, "It is interesting that you should have completed Tower symbolism by surrounding it with water" (<i>LTSM</i> 111). Unfortunately, because of some lost or misdirected correspondence, Moore failed to produce a frontispiece. But when Yeats received a copy of the volume, he wrote Moore from Rapallo on 23 February 1928, "Your cover for <i>The Tower</i> is a most rich, grave and beautiful design, admirably like the place..." (<i>LTSM</i> 123).<br><br>Yeats's earliest recorded comment on the book as a whole was made in a letter to Lady Gregory on 24 March 1928: "<i>The Tower</i> astonishes me by its bitterness." On 25 April 1928 he told Olivia Shakespear, "Re-reading <i>The Tower</i> I was astonished at its bitterness, and long to live out of Ireland that I may find some new vintage. Yet that bitterness gave the book its power and it is the best book I have written."<br><br>Although there was the odd dissenting voice, by and large the reviewers were in accord with Yeats's judgment on his achievement. Writing to Yeats less than two weeks after publication, Lennox Robinson commented that "'The Tower' seems to be getting wonderful notices, the <i>Observer</i> has it as a 'best seller'....and the <i>Independent</i> this morning is extraordinarily intelligent." Yeats himself told Lady Gregory on 1 April 1928 that "<i>Tower</i> is receiving great favour. Perhaps the reviewers know that I am so ill that I can be commended without future inconvenience....Even the Catholic Press is enthusiastic" (<i>L</i> 740). Likewise, he wrote Olivia Shakespear on 25 April 1928, "<i>The Tower</i> is a great success, two thousand copies in the first month, much the largest sale I have ever had..." (L 742). In an unsigned review in <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i> for 1 March 1928, for example, Austin Clarke found in <i>The Tower</i> "a freedom of the poetic elements, an imaginative and prosodic beauty that brings one the pure and impersonal joy of art"; he also praised "the delightful cover design of this book." Writing in <i>The Criterion</i> for September 1928, John Gould Fletcher offered <i>The Tower</i> as evidence that Yeats "corresponds, or will correspond, when the true literary history of our epoch is written, to what we moderns mean by a great poet." In <i>The New Republic</i> for 10 October 1928 Theodore Spencer noted that "on the whole, the poems in this book are among the finest Mr. Yeats has written" and that "many...will remain a permanent part of English poetry." In sum, the consensus of both the reviewers and most later critics and readers of Yeats's poetry is well represented by Virginia Woolf's judgment in an unsigned review in <i>The Nation &amp; Athenaeum</i> for 21 April 1928: "Mr. Yeats has never written more exactly and more passionately."<br><br>Most other poets would have been more than content with such acclaim, and the story of <i>The Tower</i> would have ended. But Yeats as usual was not content, and over the next five years he would make significant changes to the volume, so much so that readers who know <i>The Tower</i> only from its final version will find this facsimile edition more than a little surprising.<br><br>For the 1929 third impression Yeats made only minor changes, some as small -- but telling -- as the addition of a hyphen in "moon-luminous" ("Meditations in Time of Civil War," III.10), some more significant, such as that to lines 5-6 of "Sailing to Byzantium." The text in 1928 is virtually unpronounceable:<br><br>Fish flesh or fowl, commend all summer long<br><br>Whatever is begotten born and dies.<br><br>One is tempted to think that both Yeats and the proofreader at Macmillan had nodded off, but in fact the exact same version had appeared a year earlier in <i>October Blast</i>, and on the proofs of that volume Yeats made a correction elsewhere in the first stanza of the poem but left these lines untouched. A second version appeared when the poem was used as the epigraph in <i>Stories of Red Hanrahan and The Secret Rose</i> (1927):<br><br>Fish, flesh or fowl, commend all summer long<br><br>Whatever is begotten born and dies.<br><br>This is arguably worse, and one is again tempted to assume somnolence. However, on 10 September 1927 Yeats had written Macmillan, "I return the proof of the poem, which is now correct. Through vacillation over the punctuation of the first stanza I have made a blotted proof but I think it is clear." So it was not until the 1929 version of <i>The Tower</i> that we are offered what surely seems the inevitable version (even if grammarians would protest the comma after "fowl"):<br><br>Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long<br><br>Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.<br><br>Yeats's next opportunity to revise <i>The Tower</i> occurred in connection with the volume of <i>Poems</i> in the Edition de Luxe, a project that in the event would never see the light of day. Either when he submitted copy on 1 June 1931 or when he corrected two sets of proofs from June through September 1932, Yeats made only one change of note, but it is an important one: "From 'Oedipus at Colonus'" was removed from its placement after "The Three Monuments" and was now included as section XI of "A Man Young and Old." As the new conclusion to the sequence, the choral ode, with its celebration of "the silent kiss that ends short life or long" and its invocation of "a gay goodnight," ameliorates, or at least puts into a changed perspective, the "bitterness" of the original ending, in which the speaker lamented that "Being all alone I'd nurse a stone / And sing it lullaby."<br><br>With the Edition de Luxe in limbo, Yeats suggested to his publishers that they should bring out a regular edition of a <i>Collected Poems</i>, and they agreed. This provided another opportunity to revise <i>The Tower</i>, and Yeats did not fail to seize it. The most visible change of all was the removal of "The Gift of Harun Al-Rashid" to the "Narrative and Dramatic" section at the end of the book, where it became the final poem in the volume. In a letter of 30 March 1933, Macmillan had suggested such a two-part division for the new collection and had listed five candidates for the second section. Yeats quickly indicated that he was "delighted" with the proposal. "The Gift of Harun-Al-Rashid" had not been on Macmillan's list, but it was nevertheless absent from <i>The Tower</i> when the <i>Collected Poems</i> was published in London on 28 November 1933, in an edition of 2,040 copies. Whether this was based on a later suggestion by Macmillan or was Yeats's own idea is unknown. (My guess is the latter.) In any case, Yeats in effect replaced "The Gift of Harun Al-Rashid" with the inclusion of an entirely new poem, "Fragments": part I had been published in an essay in the <i>Dublin Magazine</i> for October-December 1931; part II was taken from a draft of the Introduction to <i>The Resurrection</i>. From a biographical perspective, "The Gift of Harun Al-Rashid" is a veiled tribute to the automatic writing and other activities by Mrs. W. B. Yeats that produced the materials for <i>A Vision</i> (1925). Its placement at the end of the <i>Collected Poems</i> was thus altogether appropriate. "Fragments" is a fanciful epitome of the longer poem, with Mrs. Yeats quite literally the "medium" who provided Yeats with the "truth" that <i>A Vision</i> would present:<br><br><b>I</b><br><br>Locke sank into a swoon;<br><br>The Garden died;<br><br>God took the spinning-jenny<br><br>Out of his side.<br><br><b>II</b><br><br>Where got I that truth?<br><br>Out of a medium's mouth,<br><br>Out of nothing it came,<br><br>Out of the forest loam,<br><br>Out of dark night where lay<br><br>The crowns of Nineveh. (<i>P</i> 217-18)<br><br>Yeats situated "Fragments" in a rather important position, between "Two Songs from a Play" and "Leda and the Swan," displacing "Wisdom" to follow "Colonus' Praise." He made two other major changes to <i>The Tower</i>: he added to "Two Songs from a Play" a fourth stanza, first published in <i>Stories of Michael Robartes and His Friends</i> (1932); and he deleted the first seventeen lines of "The Hero, the Girl, and the Fool," printing the final ten lines as "The Fool by the Roadside," the form used in <i>A Vision</i> (1925).<br><br>Yeats had one more opportunity to revise <i>The Tower</i>, in June 1937 when he submitted copy for another never-to-be-published project, the Scribner Edition; but for once he restrained himself. Thus from 1933 onward, <i>The Tower</i> was understood to be the form included in the <i>Collected Poems</i>. It is a fundamentally different volume from that first published. This present edition allows readers access to the original version, with unadorned texts and only the handful of Notes provided by Yeats. Perhaps it will also enable us to imagine how someone opening the pages of <i>The Tower</i> for the first time on Valentine's Day in 1928 would have received the masterful poems therein.<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.</p><h2>Chesty: The Story of Lieutenant General Lewis B. Puller, USMC</h2><p>The Marine Corps is known for its heroes, and Lieutenant General Lewis B. Puller has long been considered the greatest of them all. His assignments and activities covered an extraordinary spectrum of warfare. Puller mastered small unit guerrilla warfare as a lieutenant in Haiti in the 1920s, and at the end of his career commanded a division in Korea. In between, he chased Sandino in Nicaragua and fought at Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, and Peleliu. <br><br>With his bulldog face, barrel chest (which earned him the nickname Chesty), gruff voice, and common touch, Puller became&#x2014;and has remained&#x2014;the epitome of the Marine combat officer. At times Puller's actions have been called into question&#x2014;at Peleliu, for instance, where, against a heavily fortified position, he lost more than half of his regiment. And then there is the saga of his son, who followed in Chesty's footsteps as a Marine officer only to suffer horrible wounds in Vietnam (his book, <b>Fortunate Son</b>, won the Pulitzer Prize). <br><br>Jon Hoffman has been given special access to Puller's personal papers as well as his personnel record. The result will unquestionably stand as the last word about Chesty Puller.</p><p>"There are as many wild tales about Chesty Puller&#x2019;s battlefield exploits as there are Marines.

Sewing is a gift passed on to her by her mother, grandmother, and grandfather, who was a tailor. Rashida studied fashion design at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Not sure if fashion was her calling, she traded her sewing machine for a computer and worked as a freelance graphic designer. Her passion for sewing was rekindled in 2006 after the arrival of her first child, and she began the blog I Heart Linen to document her re-born creative life and her life as a stay-at-home mommy. Rashida spent much of her youth in Tokyo, Japan, where her love of linen began. Her experiences there have completely influenced her work and its style. Her work has been featured in SewNews, Stitch, SewHip!, ReadyMade, Burda Style, and Quilting Arts magazines, as well as on popular blogs such as Apartment Therapy, Design Sponge, Decor8, Craftzine, Sew, Mama, Sew, and True Up. Her first book, I Love Patchwork, was published in 2009. Rashida lives in Atlanta with her husband and their three children.If Scandinavian design doesn't appeal, perhaps you'll find this collection of projects in Japanese style more enticing.

From 1918 to 1921, through great cities and tiny villages, across untouched forests and vast frozen wasteland, the Bolshevik &#34;Reds&#34; fought the anti-Communist Whites and their Allies (fourteen foreign countries contributed weapons, money, and troops -- including 20,000 American soldiers). This landmark history re-creates the epic conflict that transformed Russia from the Empire of the Tsars into the Empire of the Commissars, while never losing sight of the horrifying human cost.<b>W.

Even the little ginger-colored maid strained her ears to listen, dreading to hear her own name bellowed in anger.<br><br> For a long, tense moment she heard only the crackling of the fire from within the kitchen house and birds chirping overhead, but then Tom shook his head and resumed eating. &#x201c;It ain&#x2019;t us,&#x201d; the lanky coachman said through a mouthful of oat porridge. &#x201c;Something happened in the city, but it ain&#x2019;t nothing to do with us.&#x201d;<br><br> Quickly the slaves finished their breakfasts, scraping their bowls with their carved wooden spoons and licking off every last savory morsel before rising and darting to work. Only the little ginger-colored maid hung back, reluctant to return to the big house and whatever storm brewed within. She busied herself gathering up the dirty bowls and spoons and carrying them to the washbasin, but as she rolled up her sleeves, the cook shook her head. &#x201c;Poppy can help me with that. You best be running off.&#x201d; Annie was only twenty or thereabouts, but she was the best cook in the Gravois Settlement and proud of it. &#x201c;Miss Julia be looking for you. Stay out of the old master&#x2019;s way and you be all right.&#x201d;<br><br> Glumly she nodded and hurried away. She found Miss Julia seated on the front piazza, frowning anxiously at her hands in her lap, a red ribbon bobbing atop her thick, glossy, dark hair in time with the swinging of her feet. She glanced up at the sound of her maid&#x2019;s bare feet on the well-worn path&#x2014;her expression sweet, her skin soft and rosy&#x2014;but she held her head awkwardly, tilting it this way and that, trying to fix her gaze on her maid despite her cross-eye. &#x201c;There you are,&#x201d; Julia cried, bounding out of her seat and down the stairs. She seized her maid&#x2019;s hand and pulled her along, her glossy curls a dark cascade down her back as they ran. The maid&#x2019;s spirits rose as they left the big house behind. She knew where Julia was leading her&#x2014;to the stables and the family&#x2019;s horses.<br><br> They heard Gabriel, the stableboy, singing before they reached the corral, before they saw him emerge from the stable, a sturdy, russet-colored boy of ten years leading the missus&#x2019;s favorite bay mare by the reins. The boy with the voice of an angel had been given a name to suit when he had been brought into the Dent household four years before. He had been called Tom then, but the old master had renamed him for the sake of the elder Tom, the ebony-skinned coachman. The maid thought it strange that she had not been given a new name too, since she shared one with her mistress. Instead, ever since the old master had bought her when she was scarcely four years old, the family and slaves had made do by calling her Julia the maid or the little ginger girl or, more often, Black Julia.<br><br> Side by side, the two Julias stood on the lowest rail and rested their elbows on the corral fence, watching Tom and Gabriel exercise the horses, which Julia adored and rode whenever the old master allowed. When they tired of this, the mistress seized her maid&#x2019;s hand again and they ran off to the kitchen house, another of Miss Julia&#x2019;s favorite places on her family&#x2019;s country estate. Julia could always charm a treat from Annie and never failed to share it. &#x201c;Ginger and cream,&#x201d; Annie often remarked when she spied the girls&#x2019; clasped hands, the darker skin against the white.<br><br> Once, years before, Julia had felt a soft, quick, wetness on the back of her wrist and turned her head in surprise to discover her mistress bent over her hand, the pink tip of her tongue still protruding between her red lips. &#x201c;I wanted to see if you tasted like ginger too,&#x201d; Julia had said, her expression embarrassed and guilty.<br><br> &#x201c;Do I?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d; Julia had frowned in disappointment. &#x201c;Just skin. And brine.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I was helping Annie pickle cucumbers.&#x201d; Impulsively, she had lifted Julia&#x2019;s hand to her mouth, her tongue darting out for a small, swift taste. &#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What? What is it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Definitely cream.&#x201d; She had nodded sagely before dissolving into giggles. &#x201c;The sweetest, freshest cream ever.&#x201d;<br><br> Julia had laughed, delighted.<br><br> Annie shooed them away soon enough, and they ran off deep into the woods encircling White Haven, to their favorite, most secret place, a beautiful, shadowy, moss-covered nook near a burbling stream that fed into the Gravois. Julia&#x2019;s favorite game was to pretend that this was a fairy bower and that she was queen of the fairies, ruling fairly and benignly over her kingdom, as confident and gracious in make-believe as she was shy in real life. The ginger maid portrayed her favorite lady-in-waiting, a deposed fairy princess from a far-off kingdom, bearing all the grace of royalty despite her more humble status.<br><br> When the sun shone high overhead, the maid, her stomach rumbling with hunger, reminded her mistress that Julia would be expected home for lunch. Just as they emerged from the woods, they halted at the sight of a pair of horses tied up at the front post and the old master greeting two men on the shaded piazza.<br><br> &#x201c;Soldiers,&#x201d; said Julia, squinting enough to make out their uniforms. &#x201c;See them for me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re officers,&#x201d; her maid replied. Her mistress&#x2019;s poor vision was a source of endless frustration, and she often called upon her maid to describe people and scenes for her, especially at a distance. But even things close to hand, like picture books and sewing, gave her headaches if she were obliged to study them too long. When Julia was first learning to read, after squinting at the reader for a quarter of an hour, her forehead would throb so painfully that she would plaintively ask her maid to see the letters aloud for her. The missus soon put a stop to that, reminding Miss Julia that slaves weren&#x2019;t allowed to read and dismissing her maid with a stern rebuke.<br><br> &#x201c;I see that much for myself,&#x201d; said Julia. &#x201c;What else?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The tall one is younger,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a lieutenant. The short, stout one has gray hair, and I think he&#x2019;s a captain. I don&#x2019;t think they ever been here before.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They must be from Jefferson Barracks,&#x201d; said Julia, her voice dropping to a murmur. &#x201c;One of the officers did something terrible.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What he do?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Let&#x2019;s listen.&#x201d;<br><br> Julia took her hand once more. They darted to the house, tiptoed up the front stairs and down the piazza, and crouched silently beneath one of the parlor windows.<br><br> What they heard chilled the maid to the bone.<br><br> A few days before, Major William Harney, the paymaster at Jefferson Barracks, had become enraged with a slave, Hannah, whom he accused of hiding or losing the keys to his sister-in-law&#x2019;s household in St. Louis, where he was residing. He had seized a piece of rawhide and had beaten her savagely upon her head, stomach, sides, back, arms and legs, rendering her unconscious, bruised, and bleeding. Hannah died the following day, and the coroner&#x2019;s jury of inquest noted that her body had been lacerated and mangled in so horrible a manner that they could not determine whether the violence had been committed with whips or hot irons. To avoid arrest&#x2014;and in advance of a mob of outraged citizens intent on stringing him up&#x2014;Major Harney had fled the city aboard a steamboat and proceeded to Washington City to request a transfer so he would never have to return to Missouri. The officers had come to warn the old master that anger against slaveholders throughout the county was soaring, and he ought to take care until it subsided.<br><br> Julia squeezed her hand. &#x201c;Did you hear? That bad man will never come back. Papa says Washington City is about as far from St. Louis as you can go.&#x201d;<br><br> She nodded, her throat constricted too much to allow speech, but her heart pounded, her mind flooded with images of a slave woman screaming in anguish as the rawhide cut into her skin, falling to her knees in a pool of her own blood&#x2014;<br> She scrambled away from the window and fled to the woods, closing her ears to Julia&#x2019;s beseeching cries.<br><br> She fled to the safest place she knew, the fairy bower, where she lay down on the soft moss and hugged her knees to her chest. Before long Julia arrived, breathless and anxious. &#x201c;I knew you would come here,&#x201d; she said, sitting down beside her. &#x201c;You mustn&#x2019;t be afraid. What happened to that poor Hannah will never happen to you. I swear I&#x2019;ll never beat you and I won&#x2019;t let anyone else either.&#x201d;<br><br> She felt a small measure of comfort, enough to compel her to sit up and wipe the tears from her face. But she knew Julia was just a little girl, eight years old like herself, and incapable of fighting off anyone who might want to hurt her.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like it when people call you Black Julia,&#x201d; the young mistress suddenly declared. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a proper name, even for a servant. But you can&#x2019;t be Julia, because I was Julia first.&#x201d;<br> She didn&#x2019;t contradict her, although she was the elder by two months and so had been called Julia longer. Her mistress was the first to be called Julia at White Haven, and she was a Dent. It was fair that she kept the name.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to call you Jule,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost Julia, but different enough so no one will need to put anything else before it to tell us apart. Do you like it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Jule, after a long moment. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then Jule it is,&#x201d; Julia proclaimed, beaming.<br><br> Jule was proud of her new name. It wasn&#x2019;t quite as well earned as Gabriel&#x2019;s, or as fancy as Suzanne&#x2019;s, but it was nice, and it was hers alone.<br><br> &#x201c;Miss Julia says we all supposed to call me Jule now,&#x201d; she told Annie that night as the weary slaves gathered at the kitchen house to eat their supper, deferred while the Dents and the livestock were seen to.<br><br> &#x201c;Really.&#x201d; Scooping stew into bowls, Annie gave her an inscrutable sidelong look. &#x201c;You proud of that odd name, ginger girl?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It ain&#x2019;t odd,&#x201d; said Jule, lifting her chin. &#x201c;Some girls called Ruby or Opal or Pearl. Why can&#x2019;t I be called Jewel?&#x201d;<br><br> One of the field hands guffawed into his stew; it might have been Dan, but she couldn&#x2019;t tell in the darkness, which on that moonless night was lifted only by the light spilling from the kitchen-house doorway and the campfire Tom and Gabriel had built.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s pretty,&#x201d; piped up Suzanne, the housekeeper&#x2019;s walnut-colored daughter. She would be the maid for Julia&#x2019;s next-eldest sister someday but as yet was too young to be much more than a playmate.<br><br> &#x201c;Pretty, huh?&#x201d; Still clutching her spoon, Annie planted a fist on her hip and regarded Jule from beneath raised brows. &#x201c;You ain&#x2019;t called jewel like no pearl or sparkling ruby. You called Jule to be short for Julia.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Annie,&#x201d; chided Tom mildly. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s just a girl.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s eight years old, old enough to know how things are. She ain&#x2019;t got no mamma, so it falls to me to tell her.&#x201d; Annie&#x2019;s expression turned solemn as she crouched low beside Jule and held her gaze. &#x201c;Listen here. Your new name just a piece of her name, just like she think you no more than a little piece of her. There&#x2019;s us, and there&#x2019;s them, and you one of us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know that,&#x201d; said Jule sullenly.<br><br> &#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t think you do. Listen, ginger girl. You ain&#x2019;t never gonna be a part of that family, no matter what Miss Julia say now, no matter how she hold your hand and tell you she love you. Soon Miss Nell gonna be old enough to be a real friend and not just a pesky little sister, and as years go by you gonna be less a friend and more a slave. It always happen that way. Unless you want your heart broke, you best get ready and watch for it coming, so it don&#x2019;t catch you by surprise.&#x201d;<br><br> Miss Julia was different, Jule told herself fiercely, interlacing her fingers over her growling stomach as Annie filled bowls with stew and she waited for one to be passed her way.<br><br> Miss Julia was different, and Jule was different. They were ginger and cream. It was not their fault they were mistress and slave too.</p><h2>History of Impressionism</h2><p>Studies the forerunners and evolution of the Impressionist movement and presents examples of paintings from the 1850&#39;s to the early 1900&#39;s</p><p></p><h2>Embassytown</h2><p>Embassytown: a city of contradictions on the outskirts of the universe.

"We can't hold on to the past," says Master Quilter Sylvia Compson, "but we can keep the best part of 'Auld Lang Syne' in our hearts and in our memories, and we can look forward to the future with hope and resolve." As Sylvia, a late-in-life newlywed, has discovered, love can enter our lives at any age. Yet before she can truly delight in her present happiness, she must face the sorrow hidden in her past -- her own role in the tragic circumstances that left her estranged from her sister, Claudia, until it was too late to make amends. Vowing not to repeat the mistake with her new daughter-in-law, Amy, who opposed Sylvia's marriage to her father, Andrew, Sylvia must convince Amy that family is more precious than pride. As Sylvia takes up a quilt for the season, begun and abandoned over six years, she recalls the New Year's Eve festivities of her youth at Elm Creek Manor as a member of the Bergstrom family. She titles the quilt "New Year's Reflections," after her belief that year-end reflections precede resolutions. The quilt blocks she chooses commemorate the wisdom that no one can ever be truly alone if she keeps the memory of those she loved and those who loved her alive in her heart. <i>The New Year's Quilt </i>is a novel to enjoy today and to treasure anew each holiday season.</p><p>Jennifer Chiaverini is the author of the<i> New York Times </i>bestselling Elm Creek Quilts series, five collections of quilt projects, and several historical fiction novels.

"We should break the news to her gently," Sylvia said. "We should sit her down, give her a stiff drink, and tell her in calm, soothing voices what we've done."</p><p>"You're likely to find that drink thrown in your face," Andrew retorted. "No, we should just tell her straight out, like tearing off a bandage. The sooner we tell her, the sooner she can start getting used to the idea."</p><p>Andrew knew his daughter better than Sylvia, but she doubted the direct approach would work. "How about this?" she suggested. "We'll say, 'Amy, dear, we have some bad news and some good news. The bad news is that we've gotten married. The good news is that since we got married on Christmas Eve, you won't have to buy us a separate wedding present.'"</p><p>"I don't like calling our marriage 'bad news.'"</p><p>"I don't either, but I'm sure that's how Amy will look at it."</p><p>"If she had any idea how happy I am that you finally consented to be my bride, I can't believe she'd refuse to be happy for us."</p><p>"Perhaps you should tell her how happy you are," said Sylvia. "Perhaps it will be as simple as that."</p><p>They considered that for a moment, and then in unison said, "I doubt it." Andrew chuckled, and Sylvia caressed his cheek before returning her gaze to the passing scenery, to snow-covered hills alight with the thin sunshine of a late December morning. She could not remember the last time she had been so content. Her husband of nearly two days was by her side, the pleasures of a winter honeymoon awaited them, and dear friends -- a second family -- would welcome them home to Elm Creek Manor after the New Year.</p><p>If only Andrew's daughter had not objected to the marriage, Sylvia's happiness would be complete.</p><p>She muffled a sigh, reluctant to allow Amy's perplexing disapproval to ruin her good spirits. If only she could rid her thoughts of Amy's last visit to Elm Creek Manor, of her disappointed frown and the determined set to her shoulders when she reminded her father of Sylvia's stroke two years earlier, of how deeply Andrew had grieved when Amy's mother died of cancer. Sylvia and Andrew tried their best to put Amy's concerns to rest, but she had made up her mind, and nothing they said could persuade her that their marriage would not inevitably end in sorrow. "We all would love for you to have many, many years together," Amy had said, "but the end is going to be the same."</p><p>Eventually Andrew had heard enough. "If being by your mother's side throughout her illness taught me anything, it showed me that nothing matters but sharing your life with the people you love. Your mother had a great love of life. I'm ashamed that in her memory, you want me to curl up in a corner and wait to die."</p><p>Amy went scarlet as her father stormed off. Sylvia tried to reassure Amy that she had fully recovered from her stroke, she was in excellent health for her age, and she had sufficient resources to ensure that she would not become a burden to anyone, but Amy could not be appeased. Having failed to persuade her father, Amy appealed to Sylvia instead, but although Sylvia offered a sympathetic smile to soften her words, she resented the younger woman's ridiculous implications that she was on her deathbed and spoke more bluntly than she should have. "I'm sure you mean well," she said, "but we've made our decision, and I'm afraid you're just going to have to live with it."</p><p>Amy's startled expression told Sylvia that Amy had never expected her concerns to be dismissed so quickly. How could she have expected anything else? She should have known that Andrew had too much honor to withdraw a marriage proposal merely to please stubborn children, especially when it went against his own wishes and all common sense.</p><p>Sylvia sighed as the winter scenery rushed past her window, dreading their arrival in Hartford and the unpleasant scene that was sure to unfold when Andrew broke the news that they had married on Christmas Eve. She was grateful for the reprieve their two-day honeymoon in New York City would provide, but she knew they were only delaying the inevitable. In her more optimistic moments, Sylvia hoped that Amy would set aside her foolish objections when she realized the deed was done, her father was married, and nothing would change that. More often, however, she feared that learning about the wedding after the fact would only inflame Amy's anger, and the recent months of estrangement between father and daughter would become a permanent condition.</p><p>The wedding had been lovely, for all that it had been pulled together in a matter of weeks. Sylvia and Andrew had hoped Amy would attend with her husband and three children, and naturally, they had invited Andrew's son, his wife, and their two daughters as well. Months earlier, Bob and Kathy had expressed misgivings when Andrew announced the engagement, but after the shock wore off, they seemed to accept his unexpected decision to remarry. Even Amy's husband had privately told the couple that he wished his own widowed father had been fortunate enough to find a second love as they had.</p><p>Sylvia and Andrew had invited everyone to Elm Creek Manor for Christmas without mentioning the wedding, a secret they had divulged only to the young couple that would act as witnesses and the judge who would officiate at the ceremony. They had intended to tell Andrew's children about the upcoming nuptials once they arrived at Elm Creek Manor, a few hours before Sylvia and Andrew would exchange their vows -- enough time for them to get used to the idea but not enough for them to arrange flights home before the ceremony. Perhaps, Sylvia reluctantly admitted to herself, their plan had been misguided, even underhanded, and far more likely to backfire than to win the children over. Not that it mattered. Amy had turned down the invitation with a weak excuse about wanting to spend a quiet Christmas at home, and Bob, unwilling to risk angering his sister by appearing to take sides, had stayed away, too.</p><p>They had missed a beautiful wedding. Sarah McClure, Sylvia's quilting apprentice and business partner, and her husband, Matt, had staged a holiday wonderland. The candlelit ballroom of Elm Creek Manor glimmered with poinsettias, ribbon, and evergreen boughs. Andrew had built a fire in the large fireplace, then added the nostalgic decoration of the nativity scene Sylvia's father had brought back from a visit to the Bergstroms' ancestral home in Baden-Baden, Germany. The youngest Elm Creek Quilter, Summer Sullivan, had taken charge of the musical entertainment, setting Christmas carols wafting on air fragrant with the scents of pine and cinnamon and roasted apples. Just across the dance floor, the cook and two assistants -- his daughter and her best friend, or so Sylvia had overheard -- placed silver trays of hors d'oeuvres and cookies on a long table and prepared the buffet for hot dishes still simmering in the kitchen. Someone had opened the curtains covering the floor to ceiling windows on the south wall, and snowflakes fell gently against the windowpanes.</p><p>Sylvia could not have imagined a more festive place to spend a Christmas Eve.</p><p>Soon guests began to fill the ballroom -- the Elm Creek Quilters and their families, other friends from the nearby town of Waterford, college students Sylvia had befriended while participating in various research projects, and Katherine Quigley, the mayor, who was one of the few people in on Sylvia and Andrew's secret. Cocktails were served, followed by a delicious meal of roasted Cornish game hen with cranberry walnut dressing that reminded Sylvia all over again why some quilters claimed they came to Elm Creek Quilt Camp for the food alone. Summer put some big band tunes on the CD player and led her boyfriend to the dance floor. Other couples joined them, and soon the room was alive with laughter, music, and the warmth of friendship.</p><p>"I don't think I've ever had a happier Christmas Eve," said Sylvia as she danced with Andrew. "I hate to see it end."</p><p>"Is that so?" He regarded her, eyebrows raised. "Does that mean you've changed your mind?"</p><p>"Of course not," she said, lowering her voice as the song ended. "In fact, I was just about to suggest we get started."</p><p>He brought her hands to his lips. "I was hoping you'd say that."</p><p>Sylvia signaled to Sarah, who found Mayor Quigley in the crowd and told her that the time had come. Andrew smiled as Sylvia fidgeted with her bouquet. "Nervous?"</p><p>"Not at all," she said. "I just hope our friends will forgive us."</p><p>"They'll have to, once we remind them that you and I never said anything about waiting until June."</p><p>"May I have everyone's attention, please?" called Sarah over the noise of the crowd. Someone turned down the volume on the stereo. "On behalf of Sylvia and Andrew and everyone who considers Elm Creek Manor a home away from home, thank you for joining us on this very special Christmas Eve."</p><p>Everyone applauded, except Andrew, who straightened his tie, and Sylvia, who took the arm of her groom.</p><p>"It is also my honor and great pleasure," said Sarah, "to inform you that you are here not only to celebrate Christmas, but also the wedding of our two dear friends, Sylvia Compson and Andrew Cooper."</p><p>Gasps of surprise and excitement quickly gave way to cheers. Sylvia felt her cheeks growing hot as their many friends turned to them, applauding and calling their names.</p><p>"You said June," one of the Elm Creek Quilters protested.</p><p>"No, <i>you</i> said June," retorted Sylvia.</p><p>"But I already bought my dress and picked out your gown!"</p><p>All present burst into laughter, and, joining in as loudly as anyone, Sarah held up her hands for quiet. "If you would all gather around, Andrew would like to escort his beautiful bride down the aisle."</p><p>The crowd parted to make way for the couple, and Summer slipped away to the CD player. As the first strains of Bach's "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" filled the air, Sylvia and Andrew walked among their guests to where the mayor waited.</p><p>To Sylvia, every moment of the simple ceremony rang as tru...</p></p><h2>The Singing Sword (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 2)</h2><p>A fictional portrait of King Arthur&#39;s great-grandfather, Publius Varius, and his wife, Luceiia, follows their desperate struggle to protect their land from the barbarian hordes threatening to overrun the last remnants of Roman civilization in Britain. 75,000 first printing.

Buechner presents the four authors who have been his greatest influences, focusing on the question that has emerged at the center of his life-how to face mortality, failure, and tragedy. Through sensitive biographical exploration and close reading of Gerard Manley Hopkins's sublime later sonnets, Mark Twain's <em>Huckleberry Finn,</em> G. K. Chesterton's <em>The Man Who Was Thursday,</em> and William Shakespeare's most powerful play,<em> King Lear,</em> Buechner invites readers to discover the deeper joy and purpose of reading. He shows how these writers -- by putting their passion and pain into their work -- have enabled him to bear the weight of his own grief and sadness by "speaking out from under the burden of theirs." Buechner's ruminations on their writings leads to the revelation that God accepts us for doing the best we can, even if our lives are in some ways a failure; even if we have lived a life haunted by tragedy, as Buechner's has been haunted by his father's suicide.</p><p>Buechner connects his readings to the fabric of his life and the lives of his subjects as he explores the ways in which these writers have shaped him and enhanced his faith. Buechner's insights into the power and imagination of their work resonate with his love for all that literature has given him throughout his life -- a passion he generously shares with us in <em>Speak What We Feel.</em></p></p><p>Great literature is like a spiritual informant, helping readers derive meaning out of the best of times and the worst of times. In <i>Speak What We Feel</i>, novelist and preacher Frederick Buechner pays homage to the worst of times, examining the life and writings of four esteemed writers and how they each came to terms with despair on the page. The title, <i>Speak What We Feel</i>, alludes to the bravery of William Shakespeare, Gerald Manley Hopkins, Mark Twain, and G.K. Chesterton--all of whom opened the veins to their hearts and let their emotions bleed upon the page. "Vein-opening writers are putting not just themselves into their books, but themselves at their nakedest and most vulnerable," writes Buechner. Not all writers do it all the time, he notes, and many writers never do it at all. "But for the four writers these pages are about, each did it at least once, and that is the most important single thing they have in common."<p> Writers who are fascinated with the process of creativity will find these essays particularly satisfying, especially the musings on Mark Twain, in which Buechner explains the internal angst that brought Huck Finn to life. Be warned that readers will probably glean more pleasure from this lovingly rendered (but occasionally dry) book if they already possess an appreciation and familiarity with the works of the writers. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><p>Frederick Buechner, author of more than thirty works of fiction and nonfiction, is an ordained Presbyterian minister.

Borg shows how we can live passionately as Christians in today's world by practicing the vital elements of Christian faith.</p><p>For the millions of people who have turned away from many traditional beliefs about God, Jesus, and the Bible, but still long for a relevant, nourishing faith, Borg shows why the Christian life can remain a transforming relationship with God. Emphasizing the critical role of daily practice in living the Christian life, he explores how prayer, worship, Sabbath, pilgrimage, and more can be experienced as authentically life-giving practices.</p><p>Borg reclaims terms and ideas once thought to be the sole province of evangelicals and fundamentalists: he shows that terms such as "born again" have real meaning for all Christians; that the "Kingdom of God" is not a bulwark against secularism but is a means of transforming society into a world that values justice and love; and that the Christian life is essentially about opening one's heart to God and to others.</p></p><p>Now in paperback, renowned and beloved author Marcus Borg presents a renewed way of being Christian for the twenty-first century.<br> <br> Borg reveals that, when properly understood, the vital elements of Christian faith are more compelling than ever. Borg offers a practical guide to thinking about God, Jesus, the Bible, faith, and Christian practice. He shows how faith in God and Jesus has never really been about believing certain propositions but rather about a dynamic relationship. He shows that being &#x201c;born again&#x201d; is at the center of Christian life and that the &#x201c;kingdom of God&#x201d; is a matter of transforming society into real world values of justice and love. And that the Christian life is essentially about opening one&#x2019;s heart&#x2014;to God and to others.<p>Marcus J.

Schiffman shifts attention away from the sensationalism surrounding who has control of the scrolls by focusing on how these texts shed light on the history of Judaism and early Christianity.</p><p>Lawrence H. Schiffman is Professor of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at New York University&#39;s Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies and in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Literatures.The most thorough and authoritative of the flood of new books occasioned by the full release of the Dead Sea Scrolls between 1991 and 1993. Schiffman (Near Eastern Studies/New York Univ.), a Hebrew and Judaic studies expert who now serves on the editorial team that is publishing the scrolls, clearly presents what scholars know and, equally important, what they don't know about the documents that many would agree constitute the greatest archaeological find of the century. He describes in considerable detail the contents and the political and religious historical context of the scrolls, produced between 150 bce and 70 ce during the Greek and Roman conquests of Palestine. But Schiffman also makes the case for a paradigm shift in the manner in which the scrolls should be viewed and interpreted. As he notes: ``The first generation of scroll scholars, primarily Christians interested in either the Hebrew Bible or the New Testament, did not understand the scrolls for what they were: documents illuminating the history of Second Temple Judaism...What resulted therefore, was a Christianized version of the scrolls.'' Schiffman, in contrast, views the scrolls as Jewish texts. He rejects earlier theories, such as that the scrolls were written by the ascetic sect of Essenes, and makes the case for many of the scrolls being of Sadducee origin (the Sadducees were an anti-Rabbinic group that had links to the priestly class). An updated tale of the discovery, acquisition, and deciphering of the Dead Sea Scrolls would make a great narrative. But this is not Schiffman's aim. For now, Edmund Wilson's 1954 The Dead Sea Scrolls, based on his New Yorker reportage, remains the classic page-turner about the scrolls. Schiffman's scholarly presentation is plodding, but his arguments and conclusions are well reasoned and reliable. (For more on the Dead Sea Scrolls, see Neil Asher Silberman, The Hidden Scrolls, p. TK.) Scholars in religious studies, seasoned scroll amateurs, and newcomers to this fascinating subject can all benefit from immersion in this welcome volume.

New material has been added to the chapters on interviewing, memoir, travel, science, sports, criticism, and humor. References are updated throughout, and new trends in nonfiction writing are addressed, such as the manipulation and fabrication of quotes and the self-aggrandizement of sportswriters at the expense of the sport. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Whether you write an occasional professional letter or a daily newspaper column, William Zinsser's <i>On Writing Well</i> should be required reading. Simplicity is Zinsser's mantra: he preaches a stripped-down writing style, strong and clear. He has no patience for excess (most use of adjectives and adverbs, he writes, just adds clutter) or tired phraseology (for instance, he'd like to outlaw all leads involving those "future archaeologists" most often found "stumbl[ing] upon the remains of our civilization"). He recommends that all writers of nonfiction read their work aloud (don't commit something to paper that you wouldn't actually say) and write under the assumption that "the reader knows nothing" (not to be confused with assuming the reader's an idiot). In addition to the chapters on the expected--usage, audience, interviews, leads--Zinsser also focuses on such trouble spots as science and technical writing, business writing, sports, and humor.</p><h2>Flying Through Midnight: A Pilot&#39;s Dramatic Story of His Secret Missions Over Laos During the Vietnam War</h2><p>Riveting, novelistic, and startlingly candid, John T. Halliday's combat memoir begins in 1970, when Halliday has just landed in the middle of the Vietnam War, primed to begin his assignment with the 606th Special Operations Squadron. But there's a catch: He's stationed in a kind of no-man's-land. No one on his base flies with ID, patches, or rank. Even as Richard Nixon firmly denies reporters' charges that the United States has forces in Laos, Halliday realizes that from his base in Thailand, he will be flying top-secret, black-ops night missions over the Laotian Ho Chi Minh Trail. <br> A naive yet thoughtful twenty-four-year-old, Halliday was utterly unprepared for the horrors of war. On his first mission, Halliday's C-123 aircraft dodges more than a thousand antiaircraft shells, and that is just the beginning. Nothing is as he expected -- not the operations, not the way his shell-shocked fellow pilots look and act, and certainly not the squadron's daredevil, seat-of-one's-pants approach to piloting. But before long, Halliday has become one of those seasoned and shell-shocked pilots, and finds himself in a desperate search for a way to elude certain death. <br> Using frank, true-to-life dialogue, potent imagery, and classic 1970s song lyrics, Halliday deftly describes the fraught Laotian skies and re-creates his struggle to navigate the frustrating Air Force bureaucracy, the deprivations of a remote base far from home and his young wife, and his fight to preserve his sanity. The resulting nonfiction narrative vividly captures not only the intricate, distorted culture of war but also the essence of the Vietnam veteran's experience of this troubled era. <br> A powerhouse fusion of pathos and humor, brutal realism and intimate reflection, <i>Flying Through Midnight</i> is a landmark contribution to war literature, revealing previously top-secret intelligence on the 606th's night missions. Fast-paced, thrilling, and bitingly intelligent, Halliday illuminates it all: the heart-pounding air battles, the close friendships, the crippling fear, and the astonishing final escape that made the telling of it possible.</p><p>When John Halliday arrived at Thailand's Nakhon Phanom Air Base in 1970, he thought the next year would bore him out of his skull. He believed his mission in the Vietnam War would be to fly cargo around Thailand. What could be easier? A couple of nights later, Halliday found himself dodging dozens of anti-aircraft shells in an aging cargo plane over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. <i>Flying Through Midnight</i> is his riveting account of his top-secret black-ops assignment--one of the most dangerous of the war. <p> Halliday flew slow propeller-driven relics at night deep into guerrilla territory in the "unofficial" war in Laos. His task with the 606th Special Operations Squadron was to help pinpoint guerrilla truck convoys for U.S. planes to bomb. Meanwhile, President Richard Nixon denied U.S. forces were fighting in Laos. Halliday wasn't even supposed to tell his wife what he was doing. His mail and phone calls were monitored, and soon he went from being a jittery FNG ("f---ing new guy") to a decorated war hero who logged 800 combat flight hours in Vietnam and the Gulf War. He was awarded the Air Force's Distinguished Flying Cross for one particularly amazing feat of bravery--a nighttime crash-landing on an unlit airstrip amid soaring mountains, which saved his crew. <i>Flying Through Midnight</i> does a remarkable job bringing to life Halliday's dramatic combat experiences, the foibles of his superiors, the brutalities of war, and the colorful quirks of his fellow flyboys, including his roommate whose favorite hobby was reading canned-food labels. There's not much here about the deeper rationale of the Vietnam War, but it's a gripping read. <i>--Alex Roslin</i></p>A WAR THAT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THERE<br>In 1970, a young American pilot arrived at a dusty, half-deserted U.S. air force base and found himself on a battlefront he'd never heard of: the secret black-ops war in Laos.<br>&nbsp;<br>A MISSION YOU COULDN'T TRAIN FOR <br>John T. Halliday was instructed to fly a retrofitted C-123 transport to direct night-time air strikes along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The mission sent Halliday, his plane, and his fellow men into the teeth of enemy fire--and required breaking every rule he had ever learned about flying.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A TRUE STORY OF EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE AND SURVIVAL AGAINST ALL ODDS<br>In this compelling account, Halliday takes us inside a top-secret air base and into the cockpit of an antiquated plane that was a lifeline for special forces on the ground. As he chronicles his evolution from a by-the-book flyboy to a daring warrior of the night, he also tells the story of a truly heroic, seemingly impossible flight: of how he and his men survived a horrific engagement with the enemy, attempted a harrowing a crash landing, and what they found deep inside a forbidden land...<br><br>&nbsp;<br>"An eternal story that transcends any war."--John J. Nance, author of <i>Free Flight</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"This book is as much about confronting the past as describing it."--<i>USA</i><i> Today</i></p><h2>The Talented Miss Highsmith: The Secret Life and Serious Art of Patricia Highsmith</h2><p>Patricia Highsmith, one of the great writers of 20th Century American fiction, had a life as darkly compelling&nbsp; as that of her favorite "hero-criminal,"&nbsp;talented Tom Ripley. In this revolutionary biography, Joan Schenkar paints a riveting portrait, from Highsmith's birth in Texas to Hitchcock's&nbsp; filming of her first novel, <i>Strangers On a Train,</i> to her long, strange, self-exile in Europe. We see her as a secret writer for the comics, a brilliant creator of disturbing fictions, and erotic predator with dozens of women (and a few good men) on her love list. <i>The Talented Miss Highsmith</i> is the first literary biography with access to Highsmith's whole story: her closest friends, her oeuvre, her archives. It's a compulsive page-turner unlike any other, a book&nbsp;worthy of Highsmith herself.</p><p>JOAN SCHENKAR is the author of <i>Truly Wilde: The Unsettling Story of Dolly Wilde </i>as well as a collection of plays, <i>Signs of Life: 6 Comedies of Menace. </i>She lives in Paris and Greenwich Village <p></p><p>EXCERPT FROM CHAPTER 1</p><p>HOW TO BEGIN: Part 1</p><p>"No writer would ever betray his secret life, it would be like standing naked in public."--Patricia Highsmith 9/3/40</p><p>AN ORDINARY DAY</p><p>On 16 November, 1973, a damp, coldish, breaking day in the tiny French village of Moncourt, France,&nbsp; Patricia Highsmith, a fifty-two year old American writer living an apparently quiet life beside a branch of the Loing Canal, lit up another <i>Gauloise jaune</i>, tightened her grip on her favorite Parker fountain pen, hunched her shoulders&nbsp; over her roll-top desk -- her oddly-jointed arms and enormous hands were long enough to reach the back of the&nbsp; roll while she was still seated &#x2013;- and jotted down in her writer's notebook a short list of helpful activites "which small children" might do "around the house."</p><p>It's a casual little list, the kind of list Pat liked to make when she was emptying out the&nbsp; back pockets of her mind, and it has the tossed-off quality of an afterthought. But as any careful reader of Highsmith knows, the time to pay special attention to her is when she seems to be lounging, negligent, or (God forbid) mildly relaxed. There is a beast crouched in every "unconcerned" corner of her writing mind and, sure enough, it springs out at us in her list's discomfiting title. "Little Crimes for Little Tots," she called it.&nbsp; And then for good measure she added a subtitle: "Things around the house which small children Can do..."</p><p>Pat had recently filled in another little list &#x2013;- it was for the comics historian Jerry Bails back in the U.S. &#x2013;- with some diversionary information about her work on the crime-busting comic book adventures of <i>Black Terror</i> and <i>Sgt. Bill King</i>, so perhaps she was&nbsp; still counting up the ways in which small children could be slyly associated with crime. In her last writer's journal, penned from the same perch in semi-suburban France, she had also spared a few thoughts for children. One of them was a simple calculation. She reckoned that "one blow in anger [would] kill, probably, a child from aged two to eight. . ." and that "Those over eight would take two blows to kill." The murderer she imagined completing this deed was none other than herself; the circumstance driving her to it was a simple one:</p><p>"One situation &#x2013; maybe one alone &#x2013; could drive me to murder: family life, togetherness." </p><p>So, difficult as it might be to imagine Pat Highsmith dipping her pen into child's play, her private writings tell us that she sometimes liked to run her mind over the more <i>outr�</i> problems of dealing with the young. And not only because her feelings for them wavered between a clinical interest in their upbringing (she made constant inquiries about the children of friends) and a violent rejection of their actual presence (she couldn't bear the <i>sounds</i> children made when they were enjoying themselves).</p><p>Like her feisty, maternal grandmother Willie Mae Stewart Coates, who used to send suggestions for improving the United States to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (and got handwritten answers back from the White House), Pat kept a drawerful of unconventional ideas for social engineering just itching to be implemented. Her notebooks are enlivened by large plans for small people, most of them modelleled on some harsh outcropping of her own rocky past. Each one adds a new terror to the study of child development.</p><p>One of her plans for youth &#x2013;- just a sample -- seems to be a barely-suppressed rehearsal of the wrench in 1927 in her own childhood when she was taken from her grandmother's care in the family-owned boarding house in Fort Worth, Texas all the way across the United States to her mother's new marriage in a cramped apartment in the upper reaches of the West Side of Manhattan. Pat's idea for child-improvement (it migrated from a serious entry in her 1966 notebook to the mind of the mentally unstable protagonist in her 1977 novel, <i>Edith's Diary</i>) was to send very young children to live in places far across the world&nbsp; --"Orphanages could be exploited for willing recruits!" she enthused, alight with her own special brand of practicality -- so that they could serve their country as "junior members of the Peace Corps." </p><p>Like a tissue-culture excised from the skin of her thoughts, her odd, off-hand little list of 16 November, 1973 (written in her house in a village so small that a visit to the Post Office lumbered her with unwanted attention) turns out to be a useful<i> entr�e</i> into the mind, the matter, and the <i>mise-en-sc�ne</i> of the talented Miss Highsmith. Among its other revelations, the list makes recommendations for people (small ones) whose lives parallel her own: people who are fragile enough to be confined to their homes, free enough to be without apparent parental supervision, and angry enough to be preoccupied with murder.&nbsp; </p><p>Here is her list. </p><p>"16/11/73 Little Crimes for Little Tots. Things around the house &#x2013; which small children can do, such as:</p><p>1) Tying string across top of stairs so adults will trip.</p><p>2) Replacing roller skate on stairs, once mother has removed it.</p><p>3) Setting careful fires, so that someone else will get the blame if possible.</p><p>4) Rearranging pills in medicine cabinets; sleeping pills into aspirin bottle. Pink laxative pills into antibiotic bottle which is kept in fridge.</p><p>5) Rat powder or flea powder into flour jar in kitchen.</p><p>6) Saw through supports of attic trap door, so that anyone walking on closed trap will fall through to stairs.</p><p>7) In summer: fix magnifying glass to focus on dry leaves, or preferably oily rags somewhere. Fire may be attributed to spontaneous combustion.</p><p>8) Investigate anti-mildew products in gardening shed. Colorless poison added to gin bottle."</p><p>A small thing but very much her own, this piece of ephemera, like almost everything Pat turned her hand to, has murder on its mind, centers itself around a house and its close environs, mentions&nbsp; a mother in a cameo role, and is highly practical in a thoroughly subversive way. </p><p>Written in the flat, dragging, uninflected style of her middle years, it leaves no particular sense that she meant it as a joke, but she must have...mustn't she? The <i>real</i> beast in Highsmith's writing has always been the double-headed dragon of ambiguity. And the dragon often appears with its second head tucked under its foreclaw and its cue-cards &#x2013;- the ones it should be flashing at us to help us with our responses &#x2013; - concealed somewhere beneath its scales. Is Pat serious? Or is she something else? </p><p>She is serious and she is <i>also</i> something else. </p><p>All her life, Pat Highsmith was drawn to list-making. She loved lists and she loved them all the more because nothing could be less representative of her chaotic, raging interior than a nice, organizing little list. Like much of what she wrote, this particular list makes use of the materials at hand: no need, children, to look further than Mother's's medecine cabinet or Father's garden shed for the means to murder your parents. Many children in Highsmith fictions, if they are physically able, murder a family member. In 1975 she would devote an entire collection of short stories, <i>The Animal Lovers Book of Beastly Murder,</i> to pets who dispatch their abusive human "parents" straight to Hell. </p><p>Nor did Pat herself usually look further than her immediate environment for props to implement her artistic motives. (And when she did, she got into artistic trouble.) Everything around her was there to be used &#x2013;- and methodically so &#x2013;- even in murder. She fed the odd bits of her gardens, her love life, the carpenter ants in her attic, her old manuscripts, her understanding of the street-plan of New York and the transvestite bars of Berlin into the furnace of her imagination &#x2013; and then let the fires do their work.</p><p></p><p>Excerpted from The Talented Miss Highsmith by Joan Schenkar.<br>Copyright � 2009 by Joan Schenkar.<br>Published in December 2009 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press.<br>All rights reserved.

An urban legend. A fall from grace. The mirror who reflects us all. Vernon Subutex was once the proprietor of Revolver, an infamous music shop in Bastille. His legend spread throughout Paris. But by the 2000s his shop is struggling. With his savings gone, his unemployment benefit cut, and the friend who had been covering his rent suddenly dead, Vernon Subutex finds himself down and out on the Paris streets. He has one final card up his sleeve. Even as he holds out his hand to beg for the first time, a throwaway comment he once made on Facebook is taking the internet by storm. Vernon does not realise this, but the word is out: Vernon Subutex has in his possession the last filmed recordings of Alex Bleach, the famous musician and Vernon&#39;s benefactor, who has only just died of a drug overdose. A crowd of people from record producers to online trolls and porn stars are now on Vernon&#39;s trail.

Before becoming a writer he worked for the BBC and has made art documentaries. He now lives in London and FranceSweetman's brilliantly illuminating biography scrupulously lays to rest any number of myths surrounding Gauguin as it dismantles the conventional image of the bourgeois Parisian stockbroker who abandoned his wife and children in search of a Tahitian paradise. By combing the records of the bourse, Sweetman, biographer of van Gogh and Mary Renault, establishes that Gauguin (1848-1903) was not a stockbroker-he was an accountant, an "office-bound drudge" who arranged the paperwork for stock settlements. Far from being a conventional bourgeois, the French painter was raised by his widowed, half-Spanish mother, Aline Chazal, who had been kidnapped and abused by her unstable father and neglected by her mother, Flor Tristan, a socialist revolutionary and one of France's first feminists. Gauguin, who called himself "the Savage from Peru," was taken to Peru when only 18 months old by his parents (his father died on shipboard) and spent the next six years there; his great-uncle was Peru's last viceroy, and Sweetman shows that Gauguin's art synthesized pre-Columbian, Christian and Polynesian myths. Mette-Sophie Gad, Gauguin's mannish, boisterous, gruff, cigar-smoking wife, had separated from the painter before he left for Tahiti in 1891; he mourned the loss of his five children, who, raised in Copenhagen, "were now little Danes with few traces of any Frenchness left." Although Sweetman calls Gauguin a "syphilitic paedophile" who took a succession of Polynesian "child-brides," he rejects feminist assessments of the artist as a sexual tourist and colonialist, arguing that Gauguin celebrated and integrated himself into a disappearing culture on the verge of extinction.

Children are invited to travel back through time and imagine life in the past. Each chapter explores a segment of medieval society (the feudal system, the life of a noble, the role of the church, etc.) and provides a selection of related activities and craft projects (e.g., make an hourglass, build a catapult, a recipe for Rose Petal Bread). Food, living conditions, and the constant warfare and its subsequent influence on how people lived and played are described. The underlying theme is that the Middle Ages was a period characterized by extreme opposites, as the ideals of the time were often in strong contrast with the realities. The text is written in a breezy tone and illustrated with a combination of line drawings and blue- or purple-ink reproductions of medieval art and woodcuts. The format is a little cluttered, but not to the point of confusion.

It is said that the vastness of the Russian landscape and the profound spirituality he perceived in the simple people he met led him to an experience of finding God in all things, and to the conviction that God seeks to be known by us as passionately as we might seek to know God. <br><br>All the great themes of Rilke's later powerful and complex poetry can be found in the <i>Stories of God </i>, yet their charming, folktale-like quality has made them among the most accessible of Rilke's works, beloved by all ages.</p><p>Rainer Maria Rilke felt that the world and all its joys most truly belonged to the young, and in &#39;Stories of God&#39; he captured for them the magic, charm and wisdom of fairy and folk tales.Rainer Maria Rilke (1875&#x2013;1926) is widely regarded as one of the greatest poets of the twentieth century. His works include <i>Duino Elegies, The Sonnets to Orpheus, </i> and <i>Letters to a Young Poet. </i></p><h2>The Bubble Of American Supremacy: Correcting The Misuse Of American Power</h2><p>Long known as "the world's only private citizen with a foreign policy," George Soros combines his razor-sharp sense of economic trends with his passionate advocacy for open societies and decency in world politics to come up with a workable, and severely critical, analysis of the Bush administration's overreaching, militaristic foreign policy.<br><br> Soros believes that this administration's plans abroad come from the same sort of "bubble" psychology that afflicted our markets in the late 1990s. They have used a real fact, our overwhelming military supremacy, to create a deluded worldview, that might makes right and that "you're either with us or against us," in the same way that the recent boom used a real fact, the growth in technology, to lead to a delusion, the "new economy."<br><br> Like the best of the books that have responded quickly to world events, <i>The Bubble of American Supremacy</i> has a clear, intriguing, comprehensive thesis that makes necessary, and compelling, order of our seemingly disordered world.<br></p><p>Proving that exorbitant wealth and allegiance to the Republican Party do not necessarily go hand in hand, billionaire George Soros offers a sharp critique of the neoconservative philosophy that he sees guiding the George W. Bush administration. In <i>The Bubble of American Supremacy</i>, Soros warns that American efforts to be the ultimate global superpower will not only be unsuccessful but will make America and the world infinitely more unstable. Bush and company, he says, have callously used the events of September 11th for their own political gain and misled the world about the threat posed by Iraq. In previous American presidential elections, billionaires Steve Forbes and Ross Perot have tried to run for president themselves to address the country's problems, but Soros--while no less zealous about his convictions--sees his role a little differently. "I have made it my primary objective to persuade the American public to reject President Bush in the upcoming elections," he writes, "We have been deceived." The arguments he makes and the evidence he presents are interesting enough, although there really isn't anything here that hasn't been written in scores of other anti-Bush books released around the same time. What sets Soros's book apart from all the others is the recurring presence of Soros himself, frequently citing previous books he's written, speeches he's made, and highlights of his career. The pronoun "I" is never far away. Granted, it's been an interesting career; his financial success coupled with his passionate political convictions would make for a terrific memoir, but at times in this book Soros's ego gets almost comically in the way. Referring to his long-held support for open societies, he says this philosophy "could almost be called the Soros doctrine" only to renounce propriety over it a page later. Soros is a capable writer and a clear thinker, and he ably articulates his views. Readers interested in criticisms of Bush and company have several options but readers interested in George Soros will find plenty to satisfy them here. <i>--John Moe</i><b>George Soros</b> heads Soros Fund Management and is the founder of a global network of foundations dedicated to supporting open societies. He is the author of several bestselling books, including <i>The Crisis of Global Capitalism, Open Society,</i> and <i>George Soros on Globalization.</i></p><h2>Death Taxes And Leaky Waders: A John Gierach Fly Fishing Treasury</h2><p>The author uses his wit and fly fishing philosophy in this collection of his essays on the art of fly fishing.</p><p>There are two things no dedicated fly-fisher can really have enough of: a decent selection of flies on the stream and a decent selection of John Gierach off of it. <i>Death, Taxes, and Leaky Waders</i> should go a good way toward satisfying the latter. In this "greatest hits" of essays culled from Gierach's previous collections, the genial wit and astute observer behind <i>Another Lousy Day in Paradise</i>, <i>Dances with Trout</i>, and <i>Trout Bum</i> reels in 40 of his favorite keepers. Considering the quality of Gierach's writing, calling <i>Headwaters</i> a "treasury" is no fish tale at all.<p> Reading <i>Leaky Waders</i> is like recalling some memorably productive afternoons on the stream with an old fishing buddy. Writing about his sport and his adventures, Gierach is naturally writing about much more: "I've always tried to figure out what a story is about," he'll admit readily. "It's something other than the fishing but that wouldn't have come up <i>without</i> the fishing." As in "The Purist," an essay from <i>The View from Rat Lake</i>: it's vintage Gierach, an excuse to use fishing to open a window onto human nature. "What is it about fly-fishing," he asks, </p><blockquote>that attracts ... those people who must engineer a corner of their lives--sometimes a pretty large corner--where things have to be done properly? I'm not sure I know, but whatever it is, it's why the sport can be used to define the very existence of the practitioner.</blockquote> From there, he connects, with deft precision, the seemingly diverse strands of his own experience as a plumber's helper, a fire on the Cuyahoga River, Zen, a little fishing history, a brief meditation on the dry fly, B.B. King, such noted anglers as G.E.M. Skues and Gierach's own great fishing accomplice A.K. Best, Idaho's Three Rivers Ranch on the Henry's Fork, and a graceful dismissal of snootiness and pretension. It's a skillful performance. Before you're finished with <i>Death, Taxes, and Leaky Waders</i>, you'll find 39 more that are just as good. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i><b>John Gierach</b> is the author of several previous books, most recently <i>Standing in a River Waving a Stick.</i> He has written for <i>Field &amp; Stream, Fly Fisherman,</i> and <i>Fly, Rod &amp; Reel,</i> among other publications.

Millions bought his books. Algren&#x2019;s third novel, <em>The Man with the Golden Arm</em>, won the first National Book Award, and Frank Sinatra starred in the movie. But despite Algren&#x2019;s talent, he abandoned fiction and fell into obscurity. The cause of his decline was never clear. Some said he drank his talent away; others cited writer&#x2019;s block. The truth, hidden in the pages of his books, is far more complicated and tragic. Now, almost forty years after Algren&#x2019;s death, Colin Asher finally captures the full, novelistic story of his life in a magisterial biography set against mid-twentieth-century American politics and culture.</p><p>Drawing from interviews, archival correspondence, and the most complete version of Algren&#x2019;s 886-page FBI file ever released, Colin Asher portrays Algren as a dramatic iconoclast. A member of the Communist Party in the 1930s, Algren used his writing to humanize Chicago&#x2019;s underclass, while excoriating the conservative radicalism of the McCarthy era. Asher traces Algren&#x2019;s development as a thinker, his close friendship and falling out with Richard Wright, and his famous affair with Simone de Beauvoir. Most intriguingly, Asher uncovers the true cause of Algren&#x2019;s artistic exile: a reckless creative decision that led to increased FBI scrutiny and may have caused a mental breakdown.</p><p>In his second act, Algren was a vexing figure who hid behind a cynical facade. He called himself a &#x201c;journalist&#x201d; and a &#x201c;loser,&#x201d; though many still considered him one of the greatest living American authors. An inspiration to writers such as Hunter S. Thompson, Martha Gellhorn, Jimmy Breslin, Betty Friedan, Cormac McCarthy, Don DeLillo, Russell Banks, and Thomas Pynchon, Algren nevertheless struggled to achieve recognition, and died just as his career was on the verge of experiencing a renaissance.</p><p><em>Never a Lovely So Real</em> offers an exquisitely detailed, engrossing portrait of a master who, as esteemed literary critic Maxwell Geismar wrote, was capable of suggesting &#x201c;the whole contour of a human life in a few terse pages.&#x201d;</p></p><p><strong>Colin Asher</strong> is an award-winning writer whose work has been featured in the <em>Believer</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em>, the <em>Boston Globe</em>, and the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>. An instructor at CUNY, he was a 2015/2016 Fellow at the Leon Levy Center for Biography.&#x201c;Colin Asher has written a deeply researched, moving account of a great writer&#x2019;s life.

Nearly four decades later, as the world's oldest astronaut, his courage riveted a nation. But these two historic events only bracket a life that covers the sweep of an extraordinary century. In this engrossing book, John Glenn tells the story of his unique life--one lived at the center of a momentous time in history by a man who helped shape that history.<br><br>He is the kind of hero who resists being called a hero. And yet his exploits in the service of his country, his dedication to family and friends, and his rock-ribbed traditional values have made this small-town boy from the Midwest a true American icon.<br><br>John Glenn's autobiography spans the seminal events of the twentieth century. It is a story that begins with his childhood in New Concord, Ohio, in the aftermath of World War I. It was there that he learned the importance of family, community, and patriotism. Glenn saw firsthand the ravages of the Depression and learned that determination, hard work, and teamwork could overcome any adversity. These were the values he carried with him as a Marine fighter pilot during World War II and into the skies over Korea, for which he would be decorated for his courage, dedication, and sacrifice. Glenn flew missions with men he would never forget, from baseball great Ted Williams to little-known heroes who would never return to their families. Always a gifted flier, it was during the war that he contemplated the unlimited possibilities of aviation and its next frontiers: speed and space.<br><br>John Glenn takes us into the cockpits of the experimental planes and spacecraft he flew to experience the pulse-pounding excitement of the early days of jet aviation, including his record-setting transcontinental flight in an F8U Crusader in 1957, and then on to his selection for the Project Mercury program in 1959. We see the early days of NASA, where he first served as a backup pilot for astronauts Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom and helped refine some of the initial cockpit and control designs for the Apollo program. In 1962 Glenn piloted the Mercury-Atlas 6 <i>Friendship 7</i> spacecraft on the first manned orbital mission of the United States. Then came several years in international business, followed by a twenty-four-year career as a U.S. senator--and in 1998 a return to space for his remarkable <i>Discovery</i> mission at the age of seventy-seven.<br><br>This extraordinary book captures the unique alchemy that brings a man to the forefront of his time. Married to a woman he first met when they were both toddlers, known for his integrity, common sense, and leadership in the Senate, John Glenn tells a story that we must hear. For this narrative of steadfastness, devotion, courage, and honor is both a great adventure tale and a source of powerful inspiration for an age that needs John Glenn's values more than ever before.</p><p>At a time when overwritten biographies arguably provide too much information about their subjects, astronaut-turned-politician-turned-astronaut John Glenn's breezy memoir is welcome. His life story is simply told, not terribly reflective but enormously compelling: an Ohio boy grows up to become the first American to orbit the earth, takes a shot at the presidency but misses, and triumphantly returns to outer space as a senior citizen and national hero. Following a section on his youth, Glenn describes being a fighter pilot in the Second World War and Korea (where he lived in the same Quonset hut as baseball legend Ted Williams), as well as a test pilot. The highlight of the book is Project Mercury, the early NASA effort that hurled Glenn 150 miles above the planet in a tiny capsule--"flying from one day into the next and back again." In less than five hours, Glenn observed three sunsets and sunrises. He also conducted a few basic experiments, such as "squeezing some applesauce from a toothpaste-like tube into my mouth to see if weightlessness interfered with swallowing. It didn't." <p> Upon his return to earth, Glenn made a few abortive runs for the Senate. He was finally elected in 1974 as a Democrat and served for 24 years. In 1984, he sought his party's presidential nomination, and it looked like he was the one candidate potentially capable of beating President Reagan. But he stumbled and had to quit. The final pages detail Glenn's 1998 mission aboard the space shuttle <i>Discovery</i> at the age of 77. Just as his journeys riveted the nation, Glenn's memoir will grip its readers. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>John Glenn has spent most of his life in public service, as a distinguished U.S. senator and a veteran of twenty-three years in the Marine Corps, during which time he was awarded numerous medals for his achievements, as well as the NASA Distinguished Service Medal and the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.

Not only did he attain America's highest office, but since leaving the White House he has worked to bring peace and hope to the least fortunate of our world. It has been said, without exaggeration, that Jimmy Carter is the only man ever to have used the presidency as a stepping-stone to greater service.<br>Turning Point is President Carter's story of how he first sought public office in 1962 and how the social and political conflicts in the South during that era shaped his vision of how people of good faith can join forces to right the wrongs of our society. By 1962, segregation laws had been declared invalid, and confrontations were taking place at lunch counters, universities, and bus depots. That spring, the Supreme Court's "one man, one vote" decision mandated equal representation for all citizens, but when Carter decided to run for the newly reconstituted Georgia state senate, his career was nearly strangled at birth. A political boss of the district, who supported Carter's opponent, was not about to let civil rights or Supreme Court decisions stand in the way of his thirst for power.<br>In re-creating his own experiences amid the volatile atmosphere of that time, Carter paints a vivid portrait of America poised on the verge of political and social change that nearly tore it apart - an image that applies just as aptly to our nation today.<br>We continue to wrestle with the same issues of fairness and equal opportunity that were the themes of Carter's first political campaign thirty years ago, and it is this persistence of inequity that has led President Carter to embark on another campaign - this one to find solutions to the problems of endemic poverty in cities. The Atlanta Project, spearheaded by The Carter Center, flows directly from our former chief executive's personal experiences and from his unshakable sense of right and wrong.<br>Turning Point illuminates the origins of President Carter's commitment to human rights and how he has labored to bring about real-life advancements for human decency. No one can read this book and not be touched by this remarkable man.</p><p>The former president&#39;s personal tale of political intrigue and social conflict during his first campaign for public office. Iluminates the origins of his commitment to human rights and bears further witness to the accomplishments of an extraordinary man.In this engrossing account of his first campaign for public office, the former President describes himself as a naive 38-year-old farmer and small-businessman who got an education in the rough-and-tumble of Georgia politics. The year was 1962, and the "one man, one vote" ruling had just been handed down by the Supreme Court. On Election Day Carter watched helplessly as Joe Hurst, a supporter of his opponent in the race for state senator, stole the election with blatant ballot-stuffing. Carter hired a lawyer and, aided by a journalist's expose, forced a recount to come up a winner. A suspenseful narrative about a neophyte's harsh introduction to regional politics, the story of Carter's local victory also illuminates the end of the legalized system of white supremacy, rural domination of government and deprivation of civil rights for blacks in the South. Noting that the race issue has returned to American politics, Carter characterizes the U.S. as a once-again segregated nation. In the concluding chapter he discusses the Atlanta Project, which he heads with the former First Lady, a project aimed at improving the quality of life in the inner cities. Photos.

But nothing can prepare them for what lies waiting aboard the Star Destroyer amid its vast creaking emptiness that isn&#x2019;t really empty at all.

He lives in central Pennsylvania with his wife, two young children, and several original Star Wars action figures.<p><i>Purge&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br></i><br>The nights were the worst.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Even before his father's death, Trig Longo had come to dread the long hours after lockdown, the shadows and sounds and the chronically unstable gulf of silence that drew out in between them. Night after night he lay still on his bunk and stared up at the dripping durasteel ceiling of the cell in search of sleep or some acceptable substitute. Sometimes he would actually start to drift off, floating away in that comforting sensation of weightlessness, only to be rattled awake-heart pounding, throat tight, stomach muscles sprung and fluttering-by some shout or a cry, an inmate having a nightmare.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>There was no shortage of nightmares aboard the Imperial Prison Barge Purge.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Trig didn't know exactly how many prisoners the Purge was currently carrying. He guessed maybe five hundred, human and otherwise, scraped from every corner of the galaxy, just as he and his family had been picked up eight standard weeks before. Sometimes the incoming shuttles returned almost empty; on other occasions they came packed with squabbling alien life-forms and alleged Rebel sympathizers of every stripe and species. There were assassins for hire and sociopaths the likes of which Trig had never seen, thin-lipped things that cackled and sneered in seditious languages that, to Trig's ears, were little more than clicks and hisses.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Every one of them seemed to harbor its own obscure appetites and personal grudges, personal histories blighted with shameful secrets and obscure vendettas. Being cautious became harder; soon you needed eyes in the back of your head-which some of them actually possessed. Two weeks earlier in the mess hall, Trig had noticed a tall, silent inmate sitting with its back to him but watching him nonetheless with a single raw-red eye in the back of its skull. Every day the red-eyed thing seemed to be sitting a little nearer. Then one day, without explanation, it was gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Except from his dreams.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Sighing, Trig levered himself up on his elbows and looked through the bars onto the corridor. Gen Pop had cycled down to minimum power for the night, edging the long gangway in permanent gray twilight. The Rodians in the cell across from his had gone to sleep or were feigning it. He forced himself to sit there, regulating his breathing, listening to the faint echoes of the convicts' uneasy groans and murmurs. Every so often a mouse droid or low-level maintenance unit, one of hundreds occupying the barge, would scramble by on some preprogrammed errand or another. And of course, below it all-low and not quite beneath the scope of hearing-was the omnipresent thrum of the barge's turbines gnashing endlessly through space.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; For as long as they'd been aboard, Trig still hadn't gotten used to that last sound, the way it shook the Purge to its framework, rising up through his legs and rattling his bones and nerves. There was no escaping it, the way it undermined every moment of life, as familiar as his own pulse.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Trig thought back to sitting in the infirmary just two weeks earlier, watching his father draw one last shaky breath, and the silence afterward as the medical droids disconnected the biomonitors from the old man's ruined body and prepared to haul it away. As the last of the monitors fell silent, he'd heard that low steady thunder of the engines, one more unnecessary reminder of where he was and where he was going. He remembered how that noise had made him feel lost and small and inescapably sad-some special form of artificial gravity that seemed to work directly against his heart. &nbsp; He had known then, as he knew now, that it really only meant one thing, the ruthlessly grinding effort of the Empire consolidating its power.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Forget politics, his father had always said. Just give 'em something they need, or they'll eat you alive. &nbsp; And now they'd been eaten alive anyway, despite the fact that they'd never been sympathizers, no more than low-level grifters scooped up on a routine Imperial sweep. The engines of tyranny ground on, bearing them forward across the galaxy toward some remote penal moon. Trig sensed that noise would continue, would carry on indefinitely, echoing right up until-&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Trig?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It was Kale's voice behind him, unexpected, and Trig flinched a little at the sound of it. He looked back and saw his older brother gazing back at him, Kale's handsomely rumpled, sleep-slackened face just a ghostly three-quarter profile suspended in the cell's gloom. Kale looked like he was still only partly awake and unsure whether or not he was dreaming any of this.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"What's wrong?" Kale asked, a drowsy murmur that came out: Wussrong?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Trig cleared his throat. His voice had started changing recently, and he was acutely aware of how it broke high and low when he wasn't paying strict attention. "Nothing."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"You worried about tomorrow?"&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Me?" Trig snorted. "Come on."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>" 'S okay if you are." Kale seemed to consider this and then uttered a bemused grunt. "You'd be crazy not to be." &nbsp; "You're not scared," Trig said. "Dad would never have-"&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"I'll go alone."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"No." The word snapped from his throat with almost painful angularity. "We need to stick together, that's what Dad said."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"You're only thirteen," Kale said. "Maybe you're not, you know..."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "Fourteen next month." Trig felt another flare of emotion at the mention of his age. "Old enough."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "You sure?"&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Positive."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "Well, sleep on it, see if you feel different in the morning..." Kale's enunciation was already beginning to go muddled as he slumped back down on his bunk, leaving Trig sitting up with his eyes still riveted to the long dark concourse outside the cell, Gen Pop, that had become their no-longer-new home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Sleep on it, he thought, and in that exact moment, miraculously, as if by power of suggestion, sleep actually began to seem like a possibility. Trig lay back and let the heaviness of his own fatigue cover him like a blanket, superseding anxiety and fear. He tried to focus on the sound of Kale's breathing, deep and reassuring, in and out, in and out. &nbsp; Then somewhere in the depths of the levels, an inhuman voice wailed. Trig sat up, caught his breath, and felt a chill tighten the skin of his shoulders, arms and back, crawling over his flesh millimeter by millimeter, bristling the small hairs on the back of his neck. Over in his bunk the already sleeping Kale rolled over and grumbled something incoherent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>There was another scream, weaker this time. Trig told himself it was just one of the other convicts, just another nightmare rolling off the all-night assembly line of the nightmare factory.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>But it hadn't sounded like a nightmare. &nbsp; It sounded like a convict, whatever life-form it was, was under attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Or going crazy. &nbsp; He sat perfectly still, squeezed his eyes tight, and waited for the pounding of his heart to slow down, just please slow down. But it didn't. He thought of the thing in the cafeteria, the disappeared inmate whose name he'd never know, watching him with its red staring eye. How many other eyes were on him that he never saw? &nbsp; Sleep on it. &nbsp; But he already knew there would be no more sleeping here tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><i>Meat Nest</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>In Trig's old life, back on Cimarosa, breakfast had been the best meal of the day. Besides being an expert trafficker in contraband, a veteran fringe dweller who cut countless deals with thieves, spies, and counterfeiters, Von Longo had also been one of the galaxy's greatest unrecognized breakfast chefs. Eat a good meal early, Longo always told his boys. You never know if it's going to be your last.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Here on the Purge, however, breakfast was rarely edible and sometimes actually seemed to shiver in the steady vibrations as though still alive on the plate. This morning Trig found himself gazing down at a pasty mass of colorless goo spooned into shaved gristle, the whole thing plastered together in sticky wads like some kind of meat nest assembled by carnivorous flying insects. He was still nudging the stuff listlessly around his tray when Kale finally raised his eyebrows and peered at him.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "You sleep at all last night?" Kale asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"A little."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"You're not eating."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"What, you mean this?" Trig poked at the contents of the tray again and shuddered. "I'm not hungry," he said, and watched Kale shovel the last bite of his own breakfast into his mouth with disturbing gusto. "You think the food will be any better when we get to the detention moon?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Little brother, I think we'll be lucky if we don't end up on the menu."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Trig gave him a bleak look. "Don't give 'em any ideas."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "Hey, lighten up." Kale wiped his mouth on his sleeve and grinned. "Little guy like you, they'll probably just use you for an appetizer."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Trig put his fork down again with a snort to show that he got the joke. Although he couldn't have articulated it, his big brother's easygoing bravado-so obviously inherited from their old man-made him downright envious. Kale wasn't wired for fear. It just didn't stick to him somehow. The only thing that ever really seemed to trouble him was the prospect of not getting another helping of whatever the COO-2180s behind the lunch counter had been slopping onto the inmates' trays.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Out of nowhere, from the ridiculous to the sublime, Trig found himself thinking about his father again. Their final conversation hung in his memory with stinging vividness. Just before he'd passed away in the infirmary, the old man had reached up, clutched Trig'...</p></p><h2>Level 1 - Theory Book: Piano Adventures</h2><p>(Faber Piano Adventures ).

What sets <i>Without a Map</i> apart is the way in which loss and betrayal evolve into compassion, and compassion into wisdom.</p><p>At the age of forty-four, Meredith Hall graduated from Bowdoin College.

She teaches writing at the University of New Hampshire and lives in Maine.Meredith Hall's long journey from an inexcusably betrayed girlhood to the bittersweet mercies of womanhood is a triple triumph&#x2014;of survival; of narration; and of forgiveness. <i>Without a Map</i> is a masterpiece.<br> &#x2014;David James Duncan, author of <i>The Brothers K and God Laughs and Plays</i><br><br>"Heartbreaking, uplifting, and luminous, <i>Without a Map</i> contains some of the most lyrical and evocative prose I have I ever read. Meredith Hall's story of loss, shame, and betrayal is also a story of joy, reconnection, and survival; each memory takes us deep to the marrow of sorrow and celebration. " &#x2014;Kim Barnes, author of <i>In the Wilderness: Coming of Age in Unknown Country</i><br><br>Winner of the <i>Elle</i> nonfiction readers&#x2019; pick for the month of April:<br>"In this stark, stunning, and devastating account of being shunned by her family and New England community after giving birth out of wedlock in the &#x2019;60s, Hall writes about what was and what might have been. Particularly moving is her haunting description of wandering in Europe and the Middle East, ultimately shoeless, penniless, and utterly alone. Refreshingly, she tells about life via a collection of beautifully rendered sketches instead of a linear narrative."&#x2014;Sheila McClear, NYC <br><br>"Meredith Hall is like a geiger counter ticking along the radium edge of these recent decades.

Bone-honest and strong in its every line, this work of memory is a remarkably deep retrieval of its times and souls, thereby reflecting our own."&#x2014;Ivan Doig, author of <i>Heart Earth</i><br><br>"<i>Without A Map</i> tells an important and perceptive story about loss, about aloneness and isolation in a time of great need, about a life slowly coming back into focus and the calm that finally emerges. Meredith Hall is a brave new writer who earns our attention."&#x2014;Annie Dillard, author of <i>For the Time Being</i><br><br>"An unusually elegant memoir that feels as though its been carved straight out of Meredith Hall&#x2019;s capacious heart. The story is riveting, the words perfect. It is rare to read a work that manages to be at once artful and compelling, which for me best describes Meredith Hall&#x2019;s debut work.

Fewer still have the courage to live like this&#x2014;without the comfort of any clich�."&#x2014;Lauren Slater, author of <i>Opening Skinner's Box, Prozac Diary</i>, and <i>Welcome to My Country</i> <br><br>"Meredith Hall's magnificent book held me in its thrall from the moment I began reading the opening pages. It is a moving example of a difficult life redeemed first through examination, then reflection, then finally it turns&#x2014;like a rough stone polished until it gleams&#x2014;into a genuine work of art."&#x2014;Dani Shapiro, author of <i>Family History</i><br><br>"Open adoptions and connections between birth mothers and their children were not the way of life for a young girl who got pregnant in the '60s. Meredith Hall, in her beautifully written, poignant memoir, tells us what life was like for a naive girl who found herself pregnant and abandoned by her mother and father. This is a tale of loss, of endless traveling in search of an intangible something, and, ultimately, of forgiveness."&#x2014;Gayle Shanks, Changing Hands Bookstore, Tempe, AZ<br><br>"Appalling and infuriating, yet uplifting and inspiring, <i>Without A Map</i> pulls you into Hall&#x2019;s personal experience of sudden rejection and expulsion from her only sources of sustenance and connection.

Meredith Hall is a hero of awesome courage and eloquence."&#x2014;Frank Kramer, Harvard Book Store, Cambridge, MA<br><br>"<i>Without a Map </i>is Meredith Hall&#x2019;s memoir, the story of giving up a child at the age of sixteen, and then meeting him when he was twenty-one, years later, and now forging a relationship with him.

N.M.C. � AudioFile 2007, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana</h2><p>Yambo, a sixtyish rare-book dealer who lives in Milan, has suffered a loss of memory-he can remember the plot of every book he has ever read, every line of poetry, but he no longer knows his own name, doesn't recognize his wife or his daughters, and remembers nothing about his parents or his childhood. In an effort to retrieve his past, he withdraws to the family home somewhere in the hills between Milan and Turin.There, in the sprawling attic, he searches through boxes of old newspapers, comics, records, photo albums, and adolescent diaries. And so Yambo relives the story of his generation: Mussolini, Catholic education and guilt, Josephine Baker, Flash Gordon, Fred Astaire. His memories run wild, and the life racing before his eyes takes the form of a graphic novel. Yambo struggles through the frames to capture one simple, innocent image: that of his first love. <br> <br>A fascinating, abundant new novel-wide-ranging, nostalgic, funny, full of heart-from the incomparable Eco. <br><br></p><p>The premise of Umberto Eco's <i>The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana,</i> may strike some readers as laughably unpromising, and others as breathtakingly rich. A sixty-ish Milanese antiquarian bookseller nicknamed Yambo suffers a stroke and loses his memory of everything but the words he has read: poems, scenes from novels, miscellaneous quotations. His wife Paola fills in the bare essentials of his family history, but in order to trigger original memories, Yambo retreats alone to his ancestral home at Solara, a large country house with an improbably intact collection of family papers, books, gramophone records, and photographs. The house is a museum of Yambo's childhood, conventiently empty of people, except of course for one old family servant with a long memory--an apt metaphor for the mind. Yambo submerges himself in these artifacts, rereading almost everything he read as a school boy, blazing a meandering, sometimes misguided, often enchanting trail of words. Flares of recognition do come, like "mysterious flames," but these only signal that Yambo remembers something; they do not return that memory to him. It is like being handed a wrapped package, the contents of which he can only guess.<p> Within the limitations of Yambo's handicap and quest, Eco creates wondrous variety, wringing surprise and delight from such shamelessly hackneyed plot twists as the discovery of a hidden room. Illustrated with the cartoons, sheet music covers, and book jackets that Yambo uncovers in his search, <i>The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana</i> can be read as a love letter to literature, a layered excavation of an Italian boyhood of the 1940s, and a sly meditation on human consciousness. Both playful and reverent, it stands with <i>The Name of the Rose</i> and <i>The Island of the Day Before</i> as among Eco's most successful novels. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2005, 0-15-101144-0 <br></p><h2>Through Siberia by Accident</h2><p><i>Through Siberia by Accident</i> is an account of a journey that didn&#x2019;t happen and what happened instead.

But with the help of one of the most underused appliances in most people&#39;s kitchen -- the freezer -- anyone can make and preserve about two weeks&#39; worth of delicious home-cooked meals in a matter of hours. Jessica Fisher&#39; s Not Your Mother provides the key to doing so. Fisher outlines 200 recipes for delectable breakfasts, lunches, and dinners through the method of batch cooking that saves both time and money. This cookbook puts a modern spin on the age-old idea of freezing meals for later, and appeals to today&#39;s diverse tastes, providing recipes for not only chicken, beef, and pork, but also fish, shellfish, and vegetarian main courses. Fisher also details how to go about using the freezer to its full potential, giving information on the best freezer bags and, most importantly, how to thaw food safely after it has been frozen.</p><p>JESSICA FISHER is a busy mom of six children, ranging from kindergarten to high school.

Contentment.<p></p> But the notion of dinner time can also bring to mind that frantic feeling when you come home tired, the dog is barking, the phone is ringing, and the entire household is clamoring, "Whats for dinner?" Stress.<p></p> You grope for an answer. Fast food? TV dinners? Canned soup? These are all quick fixes, but at what cost? All have excess sodium and additives, dubiously sourced ingredients, and questionable taste. What can you do to make mealtimes more enjoyable without resorting to less-than-best menu options? How can you make contentment, not stress, the norm at dinner time?<p></p> Turn to your freezer -- what Alton Brown calls "the most potent food-preservation device ever devised. That precious appliance can save your bacon when it comes to putting healthy, wholesome meals on the table in record time. Ive been preparing make-ahead and freeze meals for 15 years now, since I was a young high-school teacher with no one to feed but my husband and myself. Today I cook for a small army of eight: me, my husband, and our six children, aged tot to teen. And while I have my fair share of "Calgon, take me away" moments, mealtimes are usually pleasurable at our house.<p></p> Good eating has always been part of our family culture, from enjoying upscale Santa Barbara restaurants during our dating years to laughing as our first-born, at 10 months, devoured peach salsa from a spoon to grilling pizzas today on the backyard barbecue for a pack of famished children. For us, mealtimes are an event.<p></p> <p>And while I love to cook, as a work-at-home mom, I also like to enjoy time with my family. Making many meals ahead of time allows me to have the best of both worlds. I regularly spend focused time in the kitchen, cooking up a storm and stashing the results away in the freezer for later use. The outcome? Perfect homemade convenience foods that serve us well, without undue stress.</p> <p>In as little as an hour a week, you, too, can stock your freezer with make-ahead meals and meal components that are tasty, filling, healthy, and budget-friendly.</p> <p>But don&#x2019;t worry: These are not your mother&#x2019;s&#x2014;or your grandmother&#x2019;s&#x2014;frozen casseroles. Drawing on modern technology and a global food market full of diverse ingredients, the recipes that follow feature a wide variety of flavor profiles and cooking methods. They appeal to modern taste buds, and they can all be prepared in bulk to help you save time in the kitchen. These meals will put the lively voices and cozy suppers back into your dinner times.</p></p><h2>The Brendan Voyage: Across the Atlantic in a Leather Boat</h2><p>It has been described as the greatest epic voyage in modern Irish history. Tim Severin and his companions built a boat using only techniques and materials available in the sixth-century A.D., when St Brendan was supposed to have sailed to America. The vessel comprised forty-nine ox hides stitched together in a patchwork and stretched over a wooden frame. This leather skin was only a quarter of an inch thick. Yet Severin and his crew sailed Brendan from Brandon Creek in Dingle to Newfoundland, surviving storms and a puncture from pack ice. The Brendan Voyage is Tim Severin&#39;s dramatic account of their journey. This new edition of a book already translated into twenty-seven languages introduces a new generation of readers to an enduring classic. Tim Severin didn&#39;t prove St Brendan reached America, only that he could have, that it was possible. Brilliantly written, The Brendan Voyage conveys unforgettably the sensation of being in a small, open boat in the vastness of the North Atlantic, visited by inquisitive whales, reaching mist-shrouded landfalls, and receiving a welcome from seafaring folk wherever the crew touched land.</p><p>Could an Irish monk in the sixth century really have sailed all the way across the Atlantic in a small open boat, thus beating Columbus to the New World by almost a thousand years? Relying on the medieval text of St. Brendan, award-winning adventure writer Tim Severin painstakingly researched and built a boat identical to the leather curragh that carried Brendan on his epic voyage. He found a centuries-old, family-run tannery to prepare the ox hides in the medieval way; he undertook an exhaustive search for skilled harness makers (the only people who would know how to stitch the three-quarter-inch-thick hides together); he located one of the last pieces of Irish-grown timber tall enough to make the mainmast. But his courage and resourcefulness were truly tested on the open seas, including one heart-pounding episode when he and his crew repaired a dangerous tear in the leather hull by hanging over the side--their heads sometimes submerged under the freezing waves--to restitch the leather. A modern classic in the tradition of Kon-Tiki, <i>The Brendan Voyage</i> seamlessly blends high adventure and historical relevance. It has been translated into twenty-seven languages since its original publication in 1978.<br><br>With a new Introduction by Malachy McCourt, author of A Monk Swimming"Enthralling!"--The Guardian<br><br>"An extraordinary explorer." --The Independent</p><h2>33 Questions About American History You&#39;re Not Supposed to Ask</h2><p>Guess what?

And the biggest scandal of the Clinton years didn&#x2019;t involve an intern in a blue dress. <br><br>Surprised? Don&#x2019;t be. In America, where history is riddled with misrepresentations, misunderstandings, and flat-out lies about the people and events that have shaped the nation, there&#x2019;s the history you know and then there&#x2019;s the truth. <br><br>In <i>33 Questions About American History You&#x2019;re Not Supposed to Ask</i>, Thomas E.

Woods draws on real scholarship&#x2014;as opposed to the myths, platitudes, and slogans so many other &#x201c;history&#x201d; books are based on&#x2014;to ask and answer tough questions about American history, including:<br><br>- Did the Founding Fathers support immigration?<br>- Was the Civil War all about slavery?<br>- Did the Framers really look to the American Indians as the model for the U.S. political system?<br>- Was the U.S. Constitution meant to be a &#x201c;living, breathing&#x201d; document&#x2014;and does it grant the federal government wide latitude to operateas it pleases?<br>- Did Bill Clinton actually stop a genocide, as we&#x2019;re told?<br><br>You&#x2019;d never know it from the history that&#x2019;s been handed down to us, but the answer to all those questions is no. <br><br>Woods&#x2019;s eye-opening exploration reveals how much has been whitewashed from the historical record, overlooked, and skewed beyond recognition. More informative than your last U.S. history class, <i>33 Questions About American History You&#x2019;re Not Supposed to Ask</i> will have you wondering just how much about your nation&#x2019;s past you haven&#x2019;t been told.</p><p>Thomas E.

He and his family live in Alabama, where he is a fellow at the Ludwig von Mises Institute.QUESTION1<br><br>Did the Founding Fathers Support Immigration?<br><br>Though polls consistently find that a majority of Americans believe immigration levels need to be reduced, many people still assume that the right of immigration is a hallowed American principle that no loyal citizen can consistently oppose.<br><br>This assumption is false.<br><br>Actually, the Founding Fathers were generally wary of immigration. They did not wish to exclude it altogether, but they saw no particular need to encourage it, especially among migrants whose cultural backgrounds were significantly different from their own.<br><br>Consider Benjamin Franklin, that well-known cosmopolite and child of the Enlightenment. Franklin, it turns out, said quite a few politically incorrect things about non-British humanity (a category that includes the present writer). On one occasion he asked, "Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English, become a colony of aliens, who will shortly be so numerous as to Germanize us, instead of our Anglifying them, and will never adopt our language or customs any more than they can acquire our complexion?" Thus immigrants of sufficient number and concentration could radically change the cultural landscape in ways that the native population might not want.<br><br>We can already hear the modern liberal laughing at Franklin, pointing triumphantly to German assimilation in America as proof that the Pennsylvanian's concerns were without merit. But the point here is simply this: if unrestricted immigration had really been a traditional American principle, someone must have forgotten to tell Benjamin Franklin. And he was speaking of people who, as fellow heirs and architects of Western civilization, shared a great deal in common with the original settlers of British America. One can only imagine what Franklin would have had to say about current immigration policy.<br><br>JEFFERSON AND HAMILTON ON IMMIGRATION<br><br>Franklin was not alone. Thomas Jefferson's warning about mass immigration in his Notes on Virginia would doubtless come as a surprise to most Americans, since most American history textbooks for some reason choose not to highlight it. Jefferson asked suggestively, "Are there no inconveniences to be thrown into the scale against the advantage expected by a multiplication of numbers by the importation of foreigners?"<br><br>"It is for the happiness of those united in society," the sage of Monticello went on to explain, "to harmonize as much as possible, in matters which they must of necessity transact together. Civil government being the sole object of forming societies, its administration must be conducted by common consent." Our government was "a composition of the freest principles of the English Constitution, with others, derived from natural right and reason." Nothing could be more opposed to the principles of our government than those of absolute monarchies, said Jefferson. But it was from such regimes that we could expect the most immigrants.<br><br>Such immigrants, Jefferson feared, would "bring with them the principles of the governments they leave, imbibed in their early youth; or, if able to throw them off, it will be in exchange for an unbounded licentiousness, passing, as is usual, from one extreme to another. It would be a miracle were they to stop precisely at the point of temperate liberty." A large influx of immigrants from places without any experience with our kind of government and society could only introduce confusion and discord. "These principles, with their language, they will transmit to their children. In proportion to their numbers, they will share with us the legislation. They will infuse into it their spirit, warp and bias its direction, and render it a heterogeneous, incoherent, distracted mass."<br><br>Jefferson concluded that it was "safer" to wait patiently for the natural increase of the American population rather than achieve such increase by mass immigration, and that our government would, as a result, be more peaceable and more durable. He left readers with a useful thought experiment: "Suppose 20 millions of republican Americans [were] thrown all of a sudden into France, what would be the condition of that kingdom? If it would be more turbulent, less happy, less strong, we may believe that the addition of half a million of foreigners to our present numbers would produce a similar effect here."<br><br>Jefferson was joined in his wariness by Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first secretary of the treasury. In his draft of a speech for George Washington, Hamilton wrote: "To render the people of this country as homogenous as possible, must tend as much as any other circumstance to the permanence of their union and posterity."<br><br>Several years later, when Jefferson called for liberalizing the naturalization laws in his December 1801 message to Congress, Hamilton recalled Jefferson's earlier sentiments from Notes on Virginia. (This change of heart appears to have been of partisan origin: Jefferson himself, along with several of his prominent opponents, believed that the foreign vote had won him the election of 1800.) He agreed with Jefferson that it was praiseworthy for the United States to permit the entry of those experiencing genuine hardship and seeking asylum, though even here Hamilton would have reminded his fellow citizens that generosity has its limits if the welfare of the country is to be protected. What he objected to was the suggestion that all such people were necessarily entitled to the privileges of citizenship. He concluded by pointing out that even granting for the sake of argument that American Indians had extended nothing but friendship as the colonists arrived on these shores, it was important to consider the fate of a people whose policy was so magnanimous. "Prudence requires us," Hamilton wrote, "to trace the history further and ask what has become of the nations of savages who exercised this policy, and who now occupies the territory which they then inhabited? Perhaps a lesson is here taught which ought not to be despised." (The American Indians, in short, had a severe immigration problem.)<br><br>Hamilton described the safety of a republic as depending "essentially on the energy of a common national sentiment; on a uniformity of principles and habits; on the exemption of the citizens from foreign bias, and prejudice; and on that love of country which will almost invariably be found to be closely connected with birth, education, and family." He then drew out the implications of this point:<br><br>The influx of foreigners must, therefore, tend to produce a heterogeneous compound; to change and corrupt the national spirit; to complicate and confound public opinion; to introduce foreign propensities. In the composition of society, the harmony of the ingredients is all-important, and whatever tends to a discordant intermixture must have an injurious tendency.<br><br>For Hamilton, immigration policy was a matter of prudence and good sense, not a moral imperative. He observed at the turn of the nineteenth century that "in the infancy of the country, with a boundless waste to people, it was politic to give a facility to naturalization; but our situation is now changed. It appears from the last census that we have increased about one third in ten years; after allowing for what we have gained from abroad, it will be quite apparent that the natural progress of our own population is sufficiently rapid for strength, security, and settlement."<br><br>THE RIGHT TO EXCLUDE<br><br>Still others echoed these sentiments. Writing to John Adams in 1794, George Washington contended that the United States had no real reason to encourage immigration. Washington said that "except of useful mechanics and some particular descriptions of men or professions, there is no need of encouragement [of immigration], while the policy or advantage of its taking place in a body (I mean the settling of them in a body) may be much questioned; for by so doing, they retain the Language, habits, and principles (good or bad) which they bring with them."<br><br>Rufus King, who had attended the Constitutional Convention as a delegate from Massachusetts, was concerned about the character of the immigrants whom America might attract. He wrote in a 1798 letter, "It was the practice of the Emigrants from Scotland to bring with them Certificates from the religious Societies to which they belonged, of their honesty, sobriety, and generally of their good Character! Why should we not require some such Document from all Emigrants, and it would be well to add to the Testimonial that the person to whom it was granted was not expelled from his Country and had not been convicted of any crime." King wondered, "If from the emigrations of past time we have suffered inconvenience and our true national character has been disfigured, what are we to expect from the Emigrants of the present Day?"<br><br>John Jay, who would become the first chief justice of the United States, in Federalist No. 2 positively celebrated the fact that for all its "diversity," the United States consisted essentially of people whose religious and cultural traits were broadly similar and compatible, rather than widely divergent and a potential threat to social comity. "Providence," he wrote, "has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people--a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs."<br><br>According to Thomas G. West, a professor at the University of Dallas, "None of the Founders gave a theoretical account of the right of a political community to exclude would-be immigrants. That is because such a right was obvious to all as an inference from the general principles they all shared. No one in the early debates in Congress on the naturalization laws doubted the government's right to determine exclus...</p><h2>Emeraldalicious</h2><p>There is only one word to describe this title &#34;readalicious!&#34; Capitalizing on a love for all things pink, this ode to that rosy hue is exuberant&#34; -Children&#39;s Literature</p><p></p><h2>Nelson Mandela&#39;s Favorite African Folktales</h2><p><p><strong>"A treasure for everyone in the family." &#x2015;Bill Cosby</strong></p><i>Nelson Mandela's Favorite African Folktales</i> is a cause for celebration, landmark work that gathers in one volume many of Africa's most cherished folktales. Mandela, a Nobel Laureate for Peace, has selected these thirty-two tales with the specific hope that Africa's oldest stories, as well as a few new ones, be perpetuated by future generations and be appreciated by children throughout the world. In these "beloved stories, morsels rich with the gritty essence of Africa," we meet, among many others, a Kenyan lion named Simba, a snake with seven heads and a trickster from Zulu folklore; we hear the voices of the scheming hyena and learn from a Khoi fable how animals acquired their tails and horns. Several creation myths tell us how the land, its animals, and its people all came into existence under a punishing sun or against the backdrop of a spectacularly beautiful mountain landscape. Whether warning children about the dangers of disobedience or demonstrating that the underdog can and often does; win, these stories, through their depiction of wise animals as well as evil monsters, are "universal in their portrayal of humanity, beasts, and the mystical." What is particularly exciting about this book is that many of the stories, in their oral form, are almost as old as Africa itself. Most of them were, in fact, first told in various African tongues around evening fires in centuries past; tales from, for example, the San and the Khoi, the original hunter-gatherers and livestock herders of Southern Africa. Translated into English and other European languages chiefly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries from their original languages; be they Karanga, Nguni, Xhosa, or one of many others; these folktales are a testament to the craft of storytelling and the power of myth. Accompanied by dozens of enchanting, specially commissioned color paintings, <i>Nelson Mandela's Favorite African Folktales</i>; culled from African countries as far-flung as Morocco, Nigeria, Uganda, and Kenya; presents a fountain of precious knowledge that will be treasured by children, as well as adults, for years to come. color illustrations</p><p>Nelson Mandela (1918&#x2015;2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, politician, and philanthropist, who served as the first democratically-elected President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. Mandela established the Nelson Mandela Foundation as his post-presidential office in 1999. It is a not-for-profit organization which has, since 2004, been transformed into an archive and trusted voice on his life and times. It carries out its mandate to promote Mandela&#x2019;s vision and work by convening dialogues and creating platforms for engagement around critical issues to promote social justice.What a special collection of preserved and retold folklore, creation stories, and fables from Uganda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and all over the African continent! Some of the stories lend themselves better to a more dynamic reading, and those are the most successful ones in this format--CCH Pounder reading &#34;Sannie Langtand and the Visitor&#34; is a standout, as is Don Cheadle&#39;s performance of the charming &#34;Fesito Goes to Market.&#34; Not all of the celebrity narrations and individual productions are as successful--it&#39;s particularly distracting when words are obviously dubbed in, for example--but as a whole, the collection is funny and magical, enhanced by wonderful music from Johnny Clegg and Vusi Mahlasela (and don&#39;t miss the illustrations, included in a bonus PDF). That this is a benefit production makes it even more special--bravo.

He didn&#x2019;t glance around to get his bearings. He just stepped through the depot door and turned east and set out walking. No hesitation. But no speed either. He trudged along slow. He looked a little unsteady. His shoulders were slumped. He looked old and tired and worn out and beaten down. He had no enthusiasm. He looked like he was en route between two points of equally zero appeal.<br><br> The guy with the goatee beard followed along about six paces behind, hanging back, staying slow, restraining himself. Which looked difficult. He was a rangy, long-legged individual, all hopped up with excitement and anticipation. He wanted to get right to it. But the terrain was wrong. Too flat and open. The sidewalks were wide. Up ahead was a four-way traffic light, with three cars waiting for a green. Three drivers, bored, gazing about. Maybe passengers. All potential witnesses. Better to wait.<br><br> The guy with the money stopped at the curb. Waiting to cross. Aiming dead ahead. Where there were older buildings, with narrower streets between. Wider than alleys, but shaded from the sun, and hemmed in by mean three- and four-story walls either side. Better terrain.<br><br> The light changed. The guy with the money trudged across the road, obediently, as if resigned. The guy with the goatee beard followed six paces behind. Reacher closed the gap on him a little. He sensed the moment coming. The kid wasn&#x2019;t going to wait forever. He wasn&#x2019;t going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Two blocks in would do it.<br><br> They walked on, single file, spaced apart, oblivious. The first block felt good up ahead and side to side, but behind them it still felt open, so the guy with the beard hung back, until the guy with the money was over the cross street and into the second block. Which looked properly secretive. It was shady at both ends. There were a couple of boarded-up establishments, and a closed-down diner, and a tax preparer with dusty windows.<br><br> Perfect.<br><br> Decision time.<br><br> Reacher guessed the kid would go for it, right there, and he guessed the launch would be prefaced by a nervous glance all around, including behind, so he stayed out of sight around the cross street&#x2019;s corner, one second, two, three, which he figured was long enough for all the glances a person could need. Then he stepped out and saw the kid with the beard already closing the gap ahead, hustling, eating up the six-pace distance with a long and eager stride. Reacher didn&#x2019;t like running, but on that occasion he had to.<br><br> He got there too late. The guy with the beard shoved the guy with the money, who went down forward with a heavy ragged thump, hands, knees, head, and the guy with the beard swooped down in a seamless dexterous glide, into the still-moving pocket, and out again with the envelope. Which was when Reacher arrived, at a clumsy run, six feet five of bone and muscle and 250 pounds of moving mass, against a lean kid just then coming up out of a crouch. Reacher slammed into him with a twist and a dip of the shoulder, and the guy flailed through the air like a crash test dummy, and landed in a long sliding tangle of limbs, half on the sidewalk, half in the gutter. He came to rest and lay still.<br><br> Reacher walked over and took the envelope from him. It wasn&#x2019;t sealed. They never were. He took a look. The wad was about three quarters of an inch thick. A hundred dollar bill on the top, and a hundred dollar bill on the bottom. He flicked through. A hundred dollar bill in every other possible location, too. Thousands and thousands of dollars. Could be fifteen. Could be twenty grand.<br><br> He glanced back. The old guy&#x2019;s head was up. He was gazing about, panic stricken. He had a cut on his face. From the fall. Or maybe his nose was bleeding. Reacher held up the envelope. The old guy stared at it. He tried to get up, but couldn&#x2019;t.<br><br> Reacher walked back.<br> &nbsp;<br> He said, &#x201c;Anything broken?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The guy said, &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Can you move?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I think so.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;OK, roll over.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Here?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;On your back,&#x201d; Reacher said. &#x201c;Then we can sit you up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;First I need to check you out. I might need to call the ambulance. You got a phone?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No ambulance,&#x201d; the guy said. &#x201c;No doctors.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He took a breath and clamped his teeth, and squirmed and thrashed until he rolled over on his back, like a guy in bed with a nightmare.<br> &nbsp;<br> He breathed out.<br> &nbsp;<br> Reacher said, &#x201c;Where does it hurt?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Everywhere.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Regular kind of thing, or worse?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I guess regular.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;OK then.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Reacher got the flat of his hand under the guy&#x2019;s back, high up between his shoulder blades, and he folded him forward into a sitting position, and swiveled him around, and scooted him along, until he was sitting on the curb with his feet down on the road, which would be more comfortable, Reacher thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> The guy said, &#x201c;My mom always told me, don&#x2019;t play in the gutter.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mine too,&#x201d; Reacher said. &#x201c;But right now we ain&#x2019;t playing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He handed over the envelope. The guy took it and squeezed it all over, fingers and thumb, as if confirming it was real. Reacher sat down next to him. The guy looked inside the envelope.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; he said again. He pointed. &#x201c;Did that guy mug me?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Twenty feet to their right the kid with the goatee beard was face down and motionless.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He followed you off the bus,&#x201d; Reacher said. &#x201c;He saw the envelope in your pocket.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Were you on the bus too?&#x201d;<br><br> Reacher nodded.<br><br> He said, &#x201c;I came out the depot right behind you.&#x201d;<br><br> The guy put the envelope back in his pocket.<br><br> He said, &#x201c;Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You have no idea. More than I can possibly say.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome,&#x201d; Reacher said.<br><br> &#x201c;You saved my life.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;My pleasure.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I feel like I should offer you a reward.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not necessary.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t anyway,&#x201d; the guy said. He touched his pocket. &#x201c;This is a payment I have to make. It&#x2019;s very important. I need it all. I&#x2019;m sorry. I apologize. I feel bad.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Reacher said.<br><br> Twenty feet to their right the kid with the beard pushed himself up to his hands and knees.<br><br> The guy with the money said, &#x201c;No police.&#x201d;<br><br> The kid glanced back. He was stunned and shaky, but he was already twenty feet ahead. Should he go for it?<br><br> Reacher said, &#x201c;Why no police?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They ask questions when they see a lot of cash.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Questions you don&#x2019;t want to answer?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t anyway,&#x201d; the guy said again.<br><br> The kid with the beard took off. He staggered to his feet and set out fleeing the scene, weak and bruised and floppy and uncoordinated, but still plenty fast. Reacher let him go. He had run enough for one day.<br><br> The guy with the money said, &#x201c;I need to get going now.&#x201d;<br><br> He had scrapes on his cheek and his forehead, and blood on his upper lip, from his nose, which had taken a decent impact.<br><br> &#x201c;You sure you&#x2019;re OK?&#x201d; Reacher asked.<br><br> &#x201c;I better be,&#x201d; the guy said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have much time.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Let me see you stand up.&#x201d;<br><br> The guy couldn&#x2019;t. Either his core strength had drained away, or his knees were bad, or both. Hard to say. Reacher helped him to his feet. The guy stood in the gutter, facing the opposite side of the street, hunched and bent. He turned around, laboriously, shuffling in place.<br><br> He couldn&#x2019;t step up the curb. He got his foot in place, but the propulsive force necessary to boost himself up six inches was too much load for his knee to take. It must have been bruised and sore. There was a bad scuff on the fabric of his pants, right where his kneecap would be.<br><br> Reacher stood behind him and cupped his hands under his elbows, and lifted, and the guy stepped up weightless, like a man on the moon.<br><br> Reacher asked, &#x201c;Can you walk?&#x201d;<br><br> The guy tried. He managed small steps, delicate and precise, but he winced and gasped, short and sharp, every time his right leg took the weight.<br><br> &#x201c;How far have you got to go?&#x201d; Reacher asked.<br><br> The guy looked all around, calibrating. Making sure where he was.<br><br> &#x201c;Three more blocks,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;On the other side of the street.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lot of curbs,&#x201d; Reacher said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lot of stepping up and down.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll walk it off.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Show me,&#x201d; Reacher said.<br><br> The guy set out, heading east as before, at a slow shuffling creep, with his hands out a little, as if for balance. The wincing and the gasping was loud and clear. Maybe getting worse.</p><h2>Symbol Sourcebook: An Authoritative Guide to International Graphic Symbols</h2><p>&#34;A ready reference aid and an inspiration to designers . All in all the best book now available on symbols.&#34; --Library Journal This unparalleled reference represents a major achievement in the field of graphic design. Famed industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss recognized the importance of symbols in communicating more quickly and effectively; for many years he and his staff collected and codified graphic symbols as they are used in all walks of life throughout the world. The result is this &#34;dictionary&#34; of universally used graphic symbols. Henry Dreyfuss designed this sourcebook to be as practical and easy to use as possible by arranging the symbol information within ingeniously devised sections: Basic Symbols represents a concise and highly selective grouping of symbols common to all disciplines (on-off, up-down, etc.). Disciplines provides symbols used in accommodations and travel, agriculture, architecture, business, communications, engineering, photography, sports, safety, traffic controls, and many other areas. Color lists the meanings of each of the colors in various worldwide applications and cultures. Graphic Form displays symbols from all disciplines grouped according to form (squares, circles, arrows, human figures, etc.) creating a unique way to identify a symbol out of context, as well as giving designers a frame of reference for developing new symbols. To make the sourcebook truly universal, the Table of Contents contains translations of each of the section titles and discipline areas into 17 languages in addition to English.</p><p></p><h2>The Books of Blood, Vols. 1-3</h2><p>Clive Barker&#39;s The Books Of Blood - All three books complete and unabridged.</p><p>"Everybody is a book of blood; wherever we're opened, we're red." For those who only know Clive Barker through his long multigenre novels, this one-volume edition of the <i>Books of Blood</i> is a welcome chance to acquire the 16 remarkable horror short stories with which he kicked off his career. For those who already know these tales, the poignant introduction is a window on the creator's mind. Reflecting back after 14 years, Barker writes: <p> </p> I look at these pieces and I don't think the man who wrote them is alive in me anymore.... We are all our own graveyards I believe; we squat amongst the tombs of the people we were. If we're healthy, every day is a celebration, a Day of the Dead, in which we give thanks for the lives that we lived; and if we are neurotic we brood and mourn and wish that the past was still present. <p> Reading these stories over, I feel a little of both. Some of the simple energies that made these words flow through my pen--that made the phrases felicitous and the ideas sing--have gone. I lost their maker a long time ago. </p> <p> These enthusiastic tales are not ashamed of visceral horror, of blood splashing freely across the page: "The Midnight Meat Train," a grisly subway tale that surprises you with one twist after another; "The Yattering and Jack," about a hilarious demon who possesses a Christmas turkey; "In the Hills, the Cities," an unusual example of an original horror premise; "Dread," a harrowing non-supernatural tale about being forced to realize your worst nightmare; "Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament," about a woman who kills men with her mind. Some of the tales are more successful than others, but all are distinguished by strikingly beautiful images of evil and destruction. No horror library is complete without them. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Clive Barker was born in Liverpool in 1952.

He leaned over and touched his toes, then straightened and rotated his lower spine. His back was killing him. That couch was made for sitting, not sleeping.<br>He stepped to the VCR and ejected the tape. He had fallen asleep during the closing credits of the 1931 <em>Frankenstein</em>part one of Repairman Jack&#x2019;s unofficial James Whale Festival.<br>Poor Henry Frankenstein, he thought, slipping the cassette into its box. Despite all evidence to the contrary, despite what everyone around him thought, Henry had been sure he was sane.<br>Jack located the proper slot in the cassette rack on the wall, shoved <em>Frankenstein</em>in and pulled out its neighbor: <em>Bride of Frankenstein</em>, part two of his private James Whale Festival.<br>A glance out the window revealed the usual vista of sandy shore, still blue ocean, and supine sunbathers. He was tired of the view. Especially since some of the bricks had started showing through. Three years since he&#x2019;d had the scene painted on the blank wall facing the windows of this and the other bedroom. Long enough. The beach scene no longer interested him. Perhaps a rain forest mural would be better. With lots of birds and reptiles and animals hiding in the foliage. Yes...a rain forest. He filed the thought away. He&#x2019;d have to keep an eye out for someone who could do the job justice.<br>The phone began ringing in the front room. Who that could be? He&#x2019;d changed his number a couple of months ago. Only a few people had it He didn&#x2019;t bother to lift the receiver. The answerphone would take care of that. He heard a click, heard his own voice start his standard salutation:<br>&#x201c;Pinocchio Productions...I&#x2019;m not in right now, but if you&#x2019;ll--&#x201d;<br>A woman&#x2019;s voice broke in over his own, her tone impatient &#x201c;Pick up if you&#x2019;re there, Jack. Otherwise I&#x2019;ll call back later.&#x201d;<br><em>Gia</em>!<br>Jack nearly tripped over his own feet in his haste to reach the phone. He turned off the answerphone with one hand and picked up the receiver with the other.<br>&#x201c;Gia? That you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s me.&#x201d; Her voice was flat, almost resentful.<br>&#x201c;God! It&#x2019;s been a long time!&#x201d; Two months. Forever. He had to sit down. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad you called,&#x201c;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not what you think, Jack.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not calling for myself. If it were up to me I wouldn&#x2019;t be calling at all. But Nellie asked me to.&#x201d;<br>His jubilation faded, but he kept talking. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Nellie?&#x201d; He drew a blank on the name.<br>&#x201c;Nellie Paton. You must remember Nellie and Grace--the two English ladies?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, yeah. How could I forget? They introduced us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve managed to forgive them.&#x201d;<br>Jack let that go by without comment. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the problem?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Grace has disappeared. She hasn&#x2019;t been seen since she went to bed Monday night.&#x201d;<br>He remembered Grace Westphalen: a very prim and proper Englishwoman pushing seventy. Not the eloping sort.<br>&#x201c;Have the police--?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course. But Nellie wanted me to call you to see if you&#x2019;d help. So I&#x2019;m calling.&#x201d;<br>Does she want me to come over?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. If you will.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Will you be there?&#x201d;<br>She gave an exasperated sigh. &#x201c;Yes. Are you coming or not?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m on my way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Better wait. The patrolmen who were here said a detective from the department would be coming by this morning.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; That wasn&#x2019;t good.<br>&#x201c;I <em>thought</em>that might slow you up.&#x201d;<br>She didn&#x2019;t have to sound so smug about it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there after lunch.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know the address?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s a yellow townhouse on Sutton Square. There&#x2019;s only one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell her to expect you.&#x201d;<br>And then she hung up.<br>Jack tossed the receiver in his hand, cradled it on the answerphone again and flipped the switch to On;<br>He was going to see Gia today. She had called him. She hadn&#x2019;t been friendly, and she had said she was calling for someone else--but she had called. That was more than she had done since she had walked out He couldn&#x2019;t help feeling good.<br>He strolled through his third-floor apartment&#x2019;s front room which served as living room and dining room. He found the room immensely comfortable, but few visitors shared his enthusiasm. His best friend, Abe Grossman, had, in one of his more generous moods, described the room as &#x201c;claustrophobic.&#x201d; When Abe was feeling grumpy he said it made the Addams Family house look like it had been decorated by Bauhaus.<br>Old movie posters covered the walls along with bric-a-brac shelves loaded with the &#x201c;neat stuff&#x201d; Jack continually picked up in forgotten junk, stores during his wanderings through the city. He wound his way through a collection of old Victorian golden oak furniture that left little room for anything else. There was a seven-foot hutch, intricately carved, a fold-out secretary, a sagging, high-backed sofa, a massive claw-foot dining table, two end tables whose legs each ended in a bird&#x2019;s foot clasping a crystal sphere, and his favorite, a big, wing-back chair.<br>He reached the bathroom and started the hated morning ritual of shaving. As he ran the razor over his cheeks and throat he again considered the idea of a beard. He didn&#x2019;t have a bad face. Brown eyes, dark brown hair growing perhaps a little too low on his forehead. A nose neither too big nor too small. He smiled at himself in the mirror. Not an altogether hideous grimace--what they used to call a shit-eating grin. The teeth could have been whiter and straighter, and the lips were on the thin side, but not a bad smile. An inoffensive face. As an added bonus, there was a wiry, well-muscled, five-eleven frame that went along with the face at no extra charge.<br>So what&#x2019;s not to like?<br>His smile faltered.<br>Ask Gia. She seems, to think she knows what&#x2019;s not to like.<br>But all that was going to change starting today.<br>After a quick shower, he dressed and downed a couple of bowls of Cocoa Puffs, men strapped on his ankle holster and slipped the world&#x2019;s smallest .45, a Semmerling skeleton model LM-4, into it. He knew the holster was going to be hot against his leg, but he never went out unarmed. His peace of mind would compensate for any physical discomfort.<br>He checked the peephole in the front door, then twisted the central knob, retracting the four bolts at the top, bottom, and both sides. The heat in the third floor hall slammed against him at the threshhold. He was wearing Levi&#x2019;s and a lightweight short-sleeve shirt He was glad he had skipped the undershirt. Already the humidity in the hall was worming its way into his clothes and oozing over his skin as he headed down to the street.<br>Jack stood on the front steps for a moment. Sunlight glared sullenly through the haze over the roof of the Museum of Natural History far down the street to his right. The wet air hung motionless above the pavement. He could see it, smell it, taste it--and it looked, smelled, and tasted dirty. Dust, soot, and lint laced with carbon monoxide, with perhaps a hint of rancid butter from the garbage can around the corner in the alley.<br>Ah! The Upper West Side in August.<br>He ambled down to the sidewalk and walked west along the row of brownstones that lined his street to the phone booth on the corner. Not a boom, actually; an open chrome and plastic crate on a pedestal. At least it was still in one piece. At regular intervals someone yanked out its receiver, leaving multicolored strands of wire dangling from the socket like nerves from an amputated-limb stump. At other times someone would take the time and effort to jam a small wedge of paper into the coin slot, or the tips of toothpicks into the tiny spaces between die pushbuttons and the facing. He never ceased to be amazed by the strange hobbies of some of his fellow New Yorkers.<br>He dialed his office number and sounded his beeper into the mouthpiece. A recorded voice--not Jack&#x2019;s--came over the wire with the familiar message:<br>&#x201c;This is Repairman Jack. I&#x2019;m out on a call now, but when you hear the tone, leave your name and number and give me a brief idea of the nature of your problem. I&#x2019;ll get back to you as soon as possible.&#x201d;<br>There was a tone and then a woman&#x2019;s voice talking about a problem with the timer on her dryer. Another beep and a man was looking for some free information on how to fix a blender. Jack ignored the numbers they gave; he had no intention of calling them back. But how did they get his number? He had restricted his name to the white pages--with an incorrect street address, naturally--to cut down on appliance repair calls, but people managed to find him anyway.<br>The third and last voice was unique: smooth in tone, the words clipped, rapid, tinged with Britain, but definitely not British. Jack knew a couple of Pakistanis who sounded like that. The man was obviously upset, and stumbled over his words.<br>&#x201c;Mr. Jack...my mother--my grandmothers-was beaten terribly last night. I must speak to you immediately. It is terribly important.&#x201d; He gave his name and a...</p></p><h2>Anne of Green Gables (The World&#39;s Best Reading)</h2><p>Anne, an eleven-year-old orphan, is sent by mistake to live with a lonely, middle-aged brother and sister on a Prince Edward Island farm and proceeds to make an indelible impression on everyone around her.</p><p>When Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables, Prince Edward Island, send for a boy orphan to help them out at the farm, they are in no way prepared for the error that will change their lives. The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history.

Tour.</p><p>Dinesh D'Souza rates America's 40th president as one of its greatest, right below Washington and Lincoln. He makes a forceful case for this rank, probably the best yet and perhaps the best possible. In the process, he analyzes Reagan's leadership style with remarkable clarity and subtlety. Reagan seemed ordinary in so many ways, still, millions of people believed in him and followed him. Moreover, he is the patron saint of the modern conservative movement--something that he did not create, yet nonetheless came to embody. <i>Ronald Reagan: How an Ordinary Man Became an Extraordinary Leader</i> is for readers already well-disposed toward the former California governor. It may not change minds, but it will deepen the appreciation felt by Reagan's many admirers, who seem to miss the leader more with each passing day.<b>Dinesh D'Souza,</b> a research scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, served as Senior Domestic Policy Analyst in the Reagan White House from 1987 to 1988. He is the bestselling author of <i>Illiberal Education</i> and <i>The End of Racism.</i> He lives in the Washington, D.C., area with his wife, Dixie, and his daughter, Danielle.</p><h2>Death of a Celebrity (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 18)</h2><p>Constable Hamish Macbeth finds himself confronted by a wealth of suspects when gorgeous, yet vindictive, BBC reporter Crystal French, who has made many enemies in the village of Lochdubh by insulting the shopkeepers and publicly humiliating Hamish, is found murdered. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>M. C. Beaton, one of Britain&#39;s top mystery writers, lives in the Cotswolds in England.For readers who prefer their whodunits more cute than action-packed, Beaton delivers the 17th installment in his constable Hamish Macbeth series (after 2001's Death of a Dustman). Stodgy "town bobby" Hamish protects and serves the quaint Scottish highlands village of Lochdubh which sees a lot of crime for a one-horse town and outwits the Strathbane big-city police in this story of multiple murders and TV ratings. Seeking better numbers and national notice, the local station hires the glamorous and catty Crystal French, who presents some very nasty programs about what really goes on in a highland village. Needless to say, this doesn't please the local folk, and soon enough, Crystal is found murdered. Suspicion vacillates between the townspeople and the television people (including the woman whose job Crystal had taken), who have quite a few secrets of their own. Hamish sniffs around and formulates theories ("It's because I'm a village constable that I solved your murders for you. I know people better than I know police procedure"), but just when he thinks he's getting somewhere, there's another murder. Things become increasingly complicated, including Hamish's love life: local reporter Elspeth Grant is sweet on Hamish, even if he's too dense to realize it. With teasing epigrams at the start of each chapter, a good dose of Britishisms and light suspense that carries through details both quotidian (Hamish's traffic patrol and his dog Lugs) and faintly exotic (psychics and gypsies), this book is one to be enjoyed with a nice cup of tea and a biscuit.

Then she went on a long trip to the land of the dead, where ghost towns glowed blue in the dark dusk and spooky specters dwelled in cities on the Dead Sea. <br> <br> Back on Earth at last, May and her hairless cat, Somber Kitty, are now famous, their faces plastered across souvenirs and sportswear that read "May Bird Went to the Land of the Dead and All She Brought Me Was This Lousy T-Shirt." But, finally in the spotlight, May feels more than ever that she doesn't belong. Every night she sits by her bedroom window, gazing at the sky and dreaming of another place, wishing -- despite herself -- to be back among the ghosts. <br> <br> And then one night she gets her heart's desire in a way she would never have wished for. Only the Ever After isn't anything like the world May left behind three years ago. The spirits have vanished, and the towns -- once full of every manner of things that go bump in the night -- are deserted. Evil Bo Cleevil has made the Ever After as cold as his own frigid soul, and put up a bunch of tacky malls to boot. <br> <br> Now, with her friends missing and enemies all around her, May must find her way to the edge of the universe, where night swallows the stars, where allies are few and often have bad breath, where endings can also be beginnings, and where the truest hero lurks in the unlikeliest of souls. But Bo Cleevil's got one last trick up his sleeve -- one that no one on Earth is ready for. <br> <br> With the worlds of the living and the dead in the balance, will May's courage fail her one last time? Or will she finally become the warrior she was always meant to be?</p><p>Jodi Lynn Anderson is the bestselling author of several critically acclaimed books for young people, including <i>Tiger Lily</i> and the May Bird trilogy. She lives with her husband and son in Asheville, North Carolina, a city that appears to have been founded by elves.<b>Chapter One </b><p><b> May Bird Went to the Land of the Dead</b> </p><p> In an empty closet in the south bedroom, on the secondfloor of White Moss Manor, the clothes hangers jangled, as if they had been touched by a cool breeze. </p><p> On the bed by the window, swathed in an old quilt, lay two lumps, one girl-sized and one cat-sized. A dark head and a pair of ears poked out from the top of the blanket as the lumps stirred. </p><p> May sat up, wondering what had woken her, and crawled out of bed. Skinny as a stick bug and long as a shoelace, May -- at age thirteen -- was a tall, lanky sort of girl, with legs like a gazelle's and long, graceful arms that seemed a little unsure where they should tuck themselves. The hair that tumbled down her back was black and long. It glistened stubbornly in the cool December air, glossy as silk spun by caterpillars under the moon. Her brown eyes were as wide as windows, but unlike her hair, they barely glistened at all. </p><p> Somber Kitty poked his head out from under the covers to gaze at her. Wrinkly and bald, with just the faintest hint of fuzz covering him and batlike ears as big as his pointed head, Somber Kitty was a hairless Rex cat and looked like a cross between melting ice cream and an extraterrestrial. He sneezed before tucking his head back under the covers disgustedly. It was too early. May, gave the closet a curious look, a glimmer of something hopeful in her eye. And then she shook it off, sighed, and began to dress. </p><p> Her room had undergone a vast and miraculous trans-formation in the past three years. Where fantastical pictures used to hang from the walls in sloppy collages, there were now posters of pop stars and favorite movies. Where there had been inventions strewn across her desk, there was now a basket full of makeup, hairspray, and CDs. Only two drawings remained. One of Legume the dead cat. And one of a creature with a lopsided, pumpkin-shaped head. From its spot tucked away in the corner, it watched May's comings and goings with a crooked, ghastly smile. </p><p> She pulled on her long johns, then her jeans, and a bright pink sweater. She lifted Kitty out of the bed with one hand, tucked him across her shoulder like a baby, and hopped down the stairs. </p><p> White Moss Manor never glowed with homey warmth and good cheer quite the way it did at Christmas. The downstairs hall was filled with the scent of the great pine tree she and her mom had bought and decorated the day before. May slid her socked feet down the crooked, creaky hallway, breathing in the thick smell of fresh holly and evergreen sprigs. She was on her way to the kitchen when she heard a sound coming from behind her down the hall. </p><p> She switched directions and sock-slid to the end of the hall, and through the open archway into the library. White Moss Manor's library was dusty and lopsided, with books lining its shelves from floor to ceiling. The tree lights cast their sparkling reflection across the dusty old book spines and across the couch, where Mrs. Bird lay watching TV. </p><p> On the screen, a reporter was sitting in the backyard of White Moss Manor. A ten-year-old May sat beside him, skinny, tiny, and pale, looking so bedraggled she might have just tumbled out of the dryer. The man's hair was slicked back with shiny gel, his mouth open in a big, fake smile. </p><p> Ellen Bird looked up at her daughter and scooched back to make room for her. "We can change it if you want, honey. They're doing a Christmas special of their favorite news stories," she said. </p><p> "That's okay." May crawled onto the couch beside her mom, and the two curled up to each other like twin cater-pillars, Somber Kitty sniffing the crack in between them for a cozy place to snuggle. Sunday mornings at White Moss Manor usually involved eating popcorn and watching a favorite DVD, often <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i>, which Somber Kitty enjoyed most of all. </p><p> No matter how many times she had seen herself on TV, May always found it a bit eerie. She gazed at the image of her ten-year-old self, wondering if she had ever really been that person at all. </p><p> "We're here with a girl who needs no introduction. Unless you've been living under a rock the past few weeks, you've seen her -- called by many the eighth wonder of the world, her face appearing across the globe on newspapers, magazines, even these" -- he held out an armful of paraphernalia, T-shirts printed with may bird went to the land of the dead and all she brought me was this lousy t-shirt and squirt bottles labeled everlasting water bottle. </p><p> "I don't need to tell you that psychiatrists have come thousands of miles to study her. Physicists have examined her hair, her fingernails, even the stuff inside her ears. And still, we're no closer to understanding the mystery: how May Ellen Bird walked into the woods...and failed to come out again for three months." The reporter squinted meaningfully. </p><p> A growl came from somewhere off-camera, and both May and the reporter looked offscreen, where Somber Kitty had begun to grow restless. May motioned him to shush as the reporter turned back to her, clearly annoyed. "May," he said as he laid down the souvenirs, "tell us: Do you still claim that all those months you were on a journey to the land of the dead, which you say is located" -- he turned to the camera -- "on a star" -- he lowered his voice an octave -- "called the Ever After?" He turned back to May Bird, raising one eyebrow dramatically. </p><p> May stared at the reporter, then off beyond the camera at Somber Kitty. "Yes." </p><p> The reporter cleared his throat. </p><p> "And so what you're saying is, there's a world of ghosts up there, terrorized by a fearsome spirit named Evil Knievel, and protected by a wise old 'Lady of North Farm,' who lives in a giant magnolia tree in a snowy valley at the northern edge of the realm?" </p><p> May hesitated, then corrected him softly. "It's Evil Bo Cleevil." </p><p> "Right, and there in the Ever After, you were assisted by" -- the reporter studied a notepad he pulled out of his pocket -- "a ghost with a big squash-shaped head; a girl named Beatrice who died of typhoid in the early 1900s; a deceased Italian air force pilot named Captain Fabbio, who writes bad poetry; and a mischievous, handsome boy named Lucius, your love interest. Not to mention your hairless cat." The reporter smirked off-camera, in Kitty's direction. </p><p> "Well, I don't have a love interest," May stammered, blushing and clearly bewildered. </p><p> "And you say you ended up there by falling into a lake that no longer exists" -- he nodded over his shoulder -- "in the woods behind your house?" </p><p> May nodded uncertainly. </p><p> "Now, May" -- the reporter's smile turned serious -- "you have a cult following among people who believe in things like UFOs, yoga, and Bigfoot. Let me run some rumors by you. True or false: Are you carrying the spirit of Bigfoot's two-headed love child?" May shook her head, her brown eyes open wide. "Is Barbra Streisand really Cleopatra reincarnated?" May bit her lip, then shrugged. "Do you believe the reports that appeared in the <i>Questioner</i> a few weeks ago that, thanks to your story, NASA is planning to launch a space probe to look for the world of ghosts?" May shook her head. </p><p> "May, you claimed that, according to something called <i>The Book of the Dead</i>, you're supposed to save the Ever After from certain doom." He looked her up and down intently, as if to indicate the ridiculousness of this claim, given her small stature, her knobby knees, her timid disposition. He leaned forward, and his voice softened dramatically. "If that's true, why haven't the ghosts come back for you? Did they forget you exist? </p><p> Onscreen, the ten-year-old May looked over her shoulder toward the woods behind her. The trees shook and swayed in the breeze, turning up their leaves. They seemed to wave at the camera forlornly. A sad, hurt kind of tilt played at the corners of her lips, and her brown eyes grew even wider. "I don't know," she said. </p><p> "Maybe it's because there's no such thing as ghosts?" the reporter asked, smiling obligingly. </p><p> May let out a long, soft breath. </p><p> The reporter cleared his throat. "One more thing." He looked like he could barely hold back laughter, and he gave the camera a conspiratorial glance. "As our resident expert on the undead, can you tell me what the chances are that zombies might come and take over our shopping malls sometime soon?" He made a dramatic spooky face at the camera and pretended to shiver. </p><p> Click. The TV went off. </p><p> "Zombies. Of all the ridiculous..." Mrs. Bird's voice trailed off as she sat up, arranging her curly brown hair, which had shaped itself into a lopsided lump against the pillow. She shook her head. </p><p> May pulled the blankets tighter around herself. </p><p> Mrs. Bird looked at her and tilted her head slightly, sympathetic. "Oh, don't look so worried, honey. People forget these things the minute they turn the channel. When you're grown, it will all seem like a distant memory." Mrs. Bird stared at her a moment longer, intently, the way she sometimes did. At times like these, May knew her mom was wishing she could see right into her brain and find the hidden threads of the lost three unbelievable months that were woven there. But to ask again would be to break an unspoken agreement they'd had for years: to never mention May's disappearance -- or May's fantastical story of the Ever After -- to each other again. It always ended up hurting them too much, because neither could give the other what they wanted. </p><p> "Finny Elway called again," Mrs. Bird said, running a finger through May's long hair and pulling it back to braid it, absently. "He certainly is a nice boy on the phone." </p><p> May didn't answer. Finny was a boy in her class. Out of all the boys at Hog Wallow Middle, he was probably the cutest and by far the most interesting. He had hazel eyes and brown hair that flopped down in such a way that made the other girls practically faint. And he didn't eat his own boogers, which was a giant bonus. But whenever he called, May pretended to be sleeping, or to have laryngitis, or she would duck under the nearest piece of furniture so...</p></p><h2>So Worthy My Love</h2><p><p>Maxim</p> <p>Proud and passionate, the Marquess of Bradbury swore vengeance on those who had stolen his title and lands. . .and branded him a traitor to the Crown. </p><p>Elise</p> <p>Beautiful and spirited, she found herself the innocent prisoner of the marquess, her family's most hated foe. </p><p>So Worthy My Love</p> <p>They were bitter enemies caught in a dangerous tide that swept through Elizabeth's England�&#x20ac;&#x201d;And thus began a battle of wit and will between two people so perfectly matched that they could only fall in love.</p></p><p><p>(1939 - 2007) Kathleen E. Woodiwiss, creator of the modern historical romance, died July 6, 2007 in Minnesota. She had just turned 68. Her attorney, William Messerlie, said that she died after a long illness.</p> <p>Born on June 3, 1939 in Alexandria, Louisiana, Mrs. Woodiwiss was the youngest of eight siblings. She long relished creating original narratives, and by age six was telling herself stories at night to help herself fall asleep. At age 16, she met U.S. Air Force Second Lieutenant Ross Woodiwiss at a dance, and they married the following year. She wrote her first book in longhand while living at a military outpost in Japan. </p> <p>Woodiwiss is credited with the invention of the modern historical romance novel: in 1972, she released <em>The Flame and the Flower</em>, an instant <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, creating literary precedent. The <em>Flame and the Flower</em> revolutionized mainstream publishing, featuring an epic historical romance with a strong heroine and impassioned sex scenes. "Kathleeen E. Woodiwiss is the founding mother of the historical romance genre," says Carrie Feron, vice president/editorial director of William Morrow and Avon Books, imprints of HarperCollins Publishers. Feron, who has been Woodiwiss's editor for 13 years, continues, "Avon Books is proud to have been Kathleen's sole publishing partner for her paperbacks and hardcover novels for more than three decades." Avon Books, a leader in the historical romance genre to this day, remains Mrs. Woodiwiss's original and only paperback publisher; William Morrow, Avon's sister company, publishes Mrs. Woodiwiss's hardcovers. </p><p><em>The Flame and the Flower</em> was rejected by agents and hardcover publishers, who deemed it as "too long" at 600 pages. Rather than follow the advice of the rejection letters and rewrite the novel, Mrs. Woodiwiss instead submitted it to paperback publishers. The first publisher on her list, Avon, quickly purchased the novel and arranged an initial 500,000 print run. The novel sold over 2.3 million copies in its first four years of publication.</p><p>The success of this novel prompted a new style of writing romance, concentrating primarily on historical fiction tracking the monogamous relationship between a helpless heroines and the hero who rescued her, even if he had been the one to place her in danger. The romance novels which followed in her example featured longer plots, more controversial situations and characters, and more intimate and steamy sex scenes.</p> <p>"Her words engendered an incredible passion among readers," notes Feron. Bestselling author Julia Quinn agrees, saying, "Woodiwiss made women want to read. She gave them an alternative to Westerns and hard-boiled police procedurals. When I was growing up, I saw my mother and grandmother reading and enjoying romances, and when I was old enough to read them myself, I felt as if I had been admitted into a special sisterhood of reading women." </p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Susan Elizabeth Phillips, a leading voice in the women's fiction arena, says, "We all owe our careers to her. She opened the world of romance to us as readers. She created a career for us to go into." </p> <p>The pioneering author has written 13 novels over the course of 35 years, all <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers. Kathleen E. Woodiwiss's final literary work, the upcoming <em>Everlasing</em>, will be published by William Morrow in October 2007. "<em>Everlasting</em> is Kathleen's final gift to her fans," notes Feron. </p> <p>Kathleen E. Woodiwiss, who was predeceased by her husband and son Dorren, is survived by sons Sean and Heath, and numerous grandchildren.</p>The Marquess of Bradbury is a man used to taking what he wants. So when he loses his reputation, the life he has always known, and his fiancee, he is determined to win them all back, starting with the kid napping of his betrothed. But his men bungle the abduction, and instead of the haughty, aristocratic Arabella, they take her beautiful cousin, Elise. Here's what happens when the Marquess discovers the wrong woman in his castle, although he'll soon learn that she is the right one. <p>Maxim lifted the latch and pushed the door open.</p><p>"Arabella? Where are you?"</p><p>Elise had pressed herself against the wall behind the door and had been well-prepared to launch an attack upon this foolish mortal who had dared enter her chamber. She had frozen when the warm and vi brant voice stirred memories of a darkened stairway at Bradbury Hall, and she stepped from hiding, lowering the small hearthside stool she had intended to smote the visitor with. Though the man was now dressed in the manner of a wealthy lord and the beard was gone, there was no mistaking the handsome rogue.</p><p>"What the deuce . . . ?" A sharp frown quickly creased his brow as his eyes came upon her. "What are you doing here?" "'Twas you!" The sapphire-blue eyes fairly flashed with sparks of indignation." 'Twas you who bade them take me! And all the while I thought . . . aarrgh!"</p><p>In the next instant the stool was hauled back and swung with all the impetus of her outraged fury behind it. Maxim jerked back to avoid the clumsy weapon, and though he stared in utter amazement at the seething girl, the stool came around again with the same dire intent. The need to disarm the maid seemed of vital importance to his contin ued good health, and he reached up, plucking it easily from her grasp.</p><p>"Where is Arabella?" he demanded sharply. His eyes swept quickly to every corner of the chamber, but the one he sought was nowhere to be seen. </p><p>"Arabella, is it?" Elise snarled the question venomously. So! He had bade his men to fetch Arabella, and they had caught her instead. Her fair lips curled with contempt as she continued. "No doubt Arabella is wherever a good wife should be found . . . at her husband's side . . . most assuredly in England."</p><p>"In England?" The door of Maxim's understanding burst wide, ig niting the fires of his rage. He recalled this vixen all too well. When he would have rushed to Arabella's side to soften the shock of her abduction with an explanation, the meeting with this wench and her recognition of him had necessitated a change in plans. Now she was here, where his former betrothed should have been, a fact which he was certain the girl was somehow responsible for, whether by design or misfortune. "Why are you here?"</p><p>With a flippant shrug Elise flung a hand toward the door. "Ask your men. They were the ones who took me."</p><p>"They were instructed to bring Arabella here," he informed her brusquely. "What are you doing here instead?"</p><p>"You dim-witted buffoon!" Elise railed back. "Can you not hear me? If you would have the answer to that question, seek out your henchmen! That simple pair of dolts were waiting for me in Arabella's chambers. The next thing I knew I was being carried off!"</p><p>"I'll throttle them with my bare hands!" Maxim ground out. Spinning on a heel, he stormed from the room, flinging the door wide. His voice thundered ahead of him as he leapt down the stairs three at a time. "Fitch! Spence! Dammit, where are you?"</p><p>The two had left the hall and were about the same distance from the front portal when his shout halted them. Scrambling back, they hit the opening at the same time, somehow managing to wedge themselves into the narrow space. A cacophony of loud curses and clamor arose from the entrapped pair before they managed to extricate themselves. Gasping for breath, they hastened back to the Marquess who had paused in the middle of the hall. With fists braced firmly on his waist, he fixed them with a dark, ominous scowl that fairly sundered their feeble attempts to smile. His voice began as a low thundering rumble. "Do you know what you've done?"</p><p>The pair stumbled back as the last words were blared at them, and they looked at each other in was confusion. The soft whisper of foot steps compelled them to lift their worried gazes to the girl who slowly descended the stone stairs. The smile that curled her lips was one of sublime pleasure, as if she anticipated what was forthcoming. What venom had they stirred in the maid' s heart that she should countenance their comeuppance?</p><p>The two glanced between his lordship and the girl and were quick to note the absence of the blissful smiles of lovers reunited. The Marquess was genuinely enraged, there was no doubt. Those green orbs fairly burned with rage, while the muscles twitched tensely in his lean cheeks.</p><p>Glancing over his shoulder at the girl, Maxim made a request in a tightly controlled tone. "Would you be so kind, madam, as to tell us who you are."</p><p>Elise continued her leisurely descent with all the aloof dignity of a great queen. "I am Elise Madselle Radborne." Her voice, though soft, was given resonance by the echoing chamber. "Sole descendant of Sir Ramsey Radborne, only niece of Edward Stamford, and first cousin to his daughter, Arabella."</p></p><h2>Magical Girl Apocalypse Vol. 11 (Magical Girl Apocalypse, 11)</h2><p>In this final volume of season two, Mikabe&#39;s plans for his captive, Maria, are revealed as well as who he will be releasing to replace the girl he lost in battle to Shinobu, while Akuta finally reaches the lair of the witch.</p><p><b>Kentaro Sato </b>is best known as the author and artist of <i>Magical Girl </i><i>Apocalypse</i> and its spin-off series <i>Magical Girl Site</i>.</p><h2>The Price of Malice: A Joe Gunther Novel</h2><p>Wayne Castine was found brutally murdered and the murderer remains at large.

Melissa took our photograph outside, with Bobbi smoking and me self-consciously holding my left wrist in my right hand, as if I was afraid the wrist was going to get away from me. Melissa used a big professional camera and kept lots of different lenses in a special camera pouch. She chatted and smoked while taking the pictures. She talked about our performance and we talked about her work, which we&#x2019;d come across on the inter- net. Around midnight the bar closed. It was starting to rain then, and Melissa told us we were welcome to come back to her house for a drink.</p><p>We all got into the back of a taxi together and started fixing up our seat belts. Bobbi sat in the middle, with her head turned to speak to Melissa, so I could see the back of her neck and her little spoon-like ear. Melissa gave the driver an address in Monkstown and I turned to look out the window. A voice came on the radio to say the words: eighties . . . pop. . . classics. Then a jingle played. I felt excited, ready for the challenge of visiting a stranger&#x2019;s home, already preparing compliments and certain facial expressions to make myself seem charming.</p><p>The house was a semi-detached red-brick, with a sycamore tree outside. Under the streetlight the leaves looked orange and artificial. I was a big fan of seeing the insides of other people&#x2019;s houses, especially people who were slightly famous like Melissa. Right away I decided to remember everything about her home, so I could describe it to our other friends later and Bobbi could agree.</p><p>When Melissa let us in, a little red spaniel came racing up the hall and started barking at us. The hallway was warm and the lights were on. Next to the door was a low table where someone had left a stack of change, a hairbrush and an open tube of lipstick. There was a Modigliani print hanging over the staircase, a nude woman reclining. I thought: this is a whole house. A family could live here.</p><p>We have guests, Melissa called down the corridor.</p><p>No one appeared so we followed her into the kitchen. I remember seeing a dark wooden bowl filled with ripe fruit, and noticing the glass conservatory. Rich people, I thought. I was always thinking about rich people then. The dog had followed us to the kitchen and was snuffling around at our feet, but Melissa didn&#x2019;t mention the dog so neither did we.</p><p>Wine? Melissa said. White or red?</p><p>She poured huge, bowl-sized glasses and we all sat around a low table. Melissa asked us how we&#x2019;d started out performing spoken word poetry together. We had both just finished our third year of university at the time, but we&#x2019;d been per- forming together since we were in school. Exams were over by then. It was late May.</p><p>Melissa had her camera on the table and occasionally lifted it to take a photograph, laughing self-deprecatingly about being a &#x2018;work addict&#x2019;. She lit a cigarette and tipped the ash into a kitschy-looking glass ashtray. The house didn&#x2019;t smell of smoke at all and I wondered if she usually smoked in there or not.</p><p>I made some new friends, she said.</p><p>Her husband was in the kitchen doorway. He held up his hand to acknowledge us and the dog started yelping and whining and running around in circles.</p><p>This is Frances, said Melissa. And this is Bobbi. They&#x2019;re poets.</p><p>He took a bottle of beer out of the fridge and opened it on the countertop.</p><p>Come and sit with us, Melissa said.</p><p>Yeah, I&#x2019;d love to, he said, but I should try and get some sleep before this flight.</p><p>The dog jumped up on a kitchen chair near where he was standing and he reached out absently to touch its head. He asked Melissa if she had fed the dog, she said no. He lifted the dog into his arms and let the dog lick his neck and jaw. He said he would feed her, and he went back out the kitchen door again.</p><p>Nick&#x2019;s filming tomorrow morning in Cardiff, said Melissa. We already knew that the husband was an actor. He and Melissa were frequently photographed together at events, and we had friends of friends who had met them. He had a big, handsome face, and looked like he could comfortably pick Melissa up under one arm and fend off interlopers with the other.</p><p>He&#x2019;s very tall, Bobbi said.</p><p>Melissa smiled as if &#x2018;tall&#x2019; was a euphemism for some- thing, but not necessarily something flattering. The conversation moved on. We got into a short discussion about the government and the Catholic Church. Melissa asked us if we were religious and we said no. She said she found religious occasions, like funerals or weddings, &#x2018;comforting in a kind of sedative way&#x2019;. They&#x2019;re communal, she said. There&#x2019;s something nice about that for the neurotic individualist. And I went to a convent school so I still know most of the prayers.</p><p>We went to a convent school, said Bobbi. It posed issues. Melissa grinned and said: like what?</p><p>Well, I&#x2019;m gay, said Bobbi. And Frances is a communist.</p><p>I also don&#x2019;t think I remember any of the prayers, I said. We sat there talking and drinking for a long time. I</p><p>remember that we talked about the poet Patricia Lockwood, who we admired, and also about what Bobbi disparagingly called &#x2018;pay gap feminism&#x2019;. I started to get tired and a little drunk. I couldn&#x2019;t think of anything witty to say and it was hard to arrange my face in a way that would convey my sense of humour. I think I laughed and nodded a lot. Melissa told us she was working on a new book of essays. Bobbi had read her first one, but I hadn&#x2019;t.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not very good, Melissa told me. Wait till the next one comes out.</p><p>At about three o&#x2019;clock, she showed us to the spare room and told us how great it was to meet us and how glad she was that we were staying. When we got into bed I stared up at the ceiling and felt very drunk. The room was spinning repetitively in short, consecutive spins. Once I adjusted my eyes to one rotation, another would begin immediately. I asked Bobbi if she was also having a problem with that but she said no.</p><p>She&#x2019;s amazing, isn&#x2019;t she? said Bobbi. Melissa. I like her, I said.</p><p>We could hear her voice in the corridor, and her footsteps taking her from room to room. Once when the dog barked we could hear her yell something, and then her husband&#x2019;s voice. But after that we fell asleep. We didn&#x2019;t hear him leave.</p><p>/</p><p>Bobbi and I had first met in secondary school. Back then Bobbi was very opinionated, and frequently spent time in detention for a behavioural offence our school called &#x2018;disrupting teaching and learning&#x2019;. When we were sixteen she got her nose pierced and took up smoking. Nobody liked her. She got temporarily suspended once for writing &#x2018;fuck the patriarchy&#x2019; on the wall beside a plaster cast of the crucifixion. There was no feeling of solidarity around this incident. Bobbi was considered a show-off. Even I had to admit that teaching and learning went a lot more smoothly during the week she was gone.</p><p>When we were seventeen we had to attend a fundraising dance in the school assembly hall, with a partially broken disco ball casting lights on the ceiling and the barred-up windows. Bobbi wore a flimsy summer dress and looked like she hadn&#x2019;t brushed her hair. She was radiantly attractive, which meant everyone had to work hard not to pay her any attention. I told her I liked her dress. She gave me some of the vodka she was drinking from a Coke bottle and asked if the rest of the school was locked up. We checked the door up to the back staircase and found it was open. All the</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>lights were off and no one else was up there. We could hear the music buzzing through the floorboards, like a ringtone belonging to someone else. Bobbi gave me some more of her vodka and asked me if I liked girls. It was very easy to act unfazed around her. I just said: sure.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t betraying anyone&#x2019;s loyalties by being Bobbi&#x2019;s girlfriend. I didn&#x2019;t have close friends and at lunchtime I read textbooks alone in the school library. I liked the other girls, I let them copy my homework, but I was lonely and felt unworthy of real friendship. I made lists of the things I had to improve about myself. After Bobbi and I started seeing each other, everything changed. No one asked for my home- work anymore. At lunchtime we walked along the car park holding hands and people looked away from us maliciously. It was fun, the first real fun I&#x2019;d ever had.</p><p>After school we used to lie in her room listening to music and talking about why we liked each other. These were long and intense conversations, and felt so momentous to me that I secretly transcribed parts of them from memory in the evenings. When Bobbi talked about me it felt like seeing myself in a mirror for the first time. I also looked in actual mirrors more often. I started taking a close interest in my face and body, which I&#x2019;d never done before. I asked Bobbi questions like: do I have long legs? Or short?</p><p>At our school graduation ceremony we performed a spoken word piece together. Some of the parents cried, but our classmates just looked out the assembly-room windows or talked quietly amongst themselves. Several months later, after more than a year together, Bobbi and I broke up.</p><p>/</p><p>Melissa wanted to write a profile about us. She sent us an email asking if we were interested, and attached some of the photographs she had taken outside the bar. Alone in my room, I downloaded one of the files and opened it up to full- screen. Bobbi looked back at me, mischievous, holding a cigarette in her right hand and pulling on her fur stole with the other. Beside her, I looked bored and interesting. I tried to imagine my name appearing in a profile piece, in a serif font with thick stems. I decided I would try harder to impress Melissa next time we met.</p><p>Bobbi called me almost immediately after the email arrived. Have you seen the photographs? she said. I think I&#x2019;m in</p><p>love with her.</p><p>I held my phone in one hand and zoomed in on Bobbi&#x2019;s face with the other. It was a high-quality image but I zoomed until I could see the pixellation.</p><p>Maybe you&#x2019;re just in love with your own face, I said.</p><p>Just because I have a beautiful face doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m a narcissist.</p><p>I let that one go. I was involved in the zooming process still. I knew that Melissa wrote for several big literary web- sites, and her work circulated widely online. She had written a famous essay about the Oscars which everyone reposted every year during awards season. Sometimes she also wrote local profiles, about artists who sold their work on Grafton Street or buskers in London; these were always accompanied by beautiful photographs of her subjects, looking human and full of &#x2018;character&#x2019;. I zoomed back out and tried to look at my own face as if I were a stranger on the internet seeing it for the first time. It looked round and white, the eyebrows like overturned parentheses, my eyes averted from the lens, almost shut. Even I could see I had character.</p><p>We emailed her back saying we&#x2019;d be delighted, and she invited us over for dinner to talk about our work and get some additional photographs. Bobbi and I discussed at length what Bobbi would wear to this event, under the guise of talking about what we should both wear. I lay in my room watching her look at herself in the mirror, moving pieces of her hair back and forth critically.</p><p>So when you say you&#x2019;re in love with Melissa, I said. I mean I have a crush on her.</p><p>You know she&#x2019;s married.</p><p>You don&#x2019;t think she likes me? said Bobbi.</p><p>She was holding up one of my white brushed-cotton shirts in front of the mirror.</p><p>What do you mean likes you? I said. Are we being serious or just joking?</p><p>I am partly being serious. I think she does like me. In an extramarital affair kind of way?</p><p>Bobbi just laughed at that. With other people I generally had a sense of what to take seriously and what not to, but with Bobbi it was impossible. She never seemed to be either fully serious or fully joking. As a result I had learned to adopt a kind of Zen acceptance of the weird things she said. I watched her take her blouse off and pull on the white shirt. She rolled up the sleeves carefully.</p><p>Good? she said. Or terrible? Good. It looks good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>It rained all day before we went for dinner at Melissa&#x2019;s. I sat in bed in the morning writing poetry, hitting the return key whenever I wanted. Eventually I opened my blinds, read the news online and showered. My apartment had a door out into the courtyard of the building, which was lavish with greenery and featured a cherry blossom tree in the far corner. It was almost June now, but in April the blossoms were bright and silky like confetti. The couple next door had a little baby who cried sometimes at night. I liked living there.</p><p>Bobbi and I met in town that evening and got a bus to Monkstown. Finding our way back to the house felt like unwrapping something in a game of pass the parcel. I mentioned this to Bobbi on the way and she said: is it the prize, or just another layer of wrapping?</p><p>We&#x2019;ll catch up on that after dinner, I said.</p><p>When we rang the bell, Melissa answered the door with her camera slung over one shoulder. She thanked us for coming. She had an expressive, conspiratorial smile, which I thought she probably gave to all of her subjects, as if to say: you&#x2019;re no ordinary subject to me, you&#x2019;re a special favourite. I knew I would enviously practise this smile later in a mirror. The spaniel yapped in the kitchen doorway while we hung up our jackets.</p><p>In the kitchen her husband was chopping vegetables. The dog was really excited by this gathering. It leapt onto a kitchen chair and barked for ten or twenty seconds before he told it to stop.</p><p>Can we get you both a glass of wine? Melissa said.</p><p>We said sure, and Nick poured the glasses. I had looked him up online since the first time we met him, partly because I didn&#x2019;t know any other actors in real life. He had mainly worked in theatre, but also did some TV and film. He had once, several years previously, been nominated for a major award, which he didn&#x2019;t win. I&#x2019;d happened on a whole selection of shirtless photographs, most of which showed him looking younger, coming out of a swimming pool or showering on a TV show that had long ago been cancelled. I sent Bobbi a link to one of these photographs with the message: trophy husband.</p><p>Melissa didn&#x2019;t appear in many photographs on the inter- net, though her collection of essays had generated a lot of publicity. I didn&#x2019;t know how long she had been married to Nick. Neither of them was famous enough for that kind of information to be online.</p><p>So you guys write everything together? Melissa said.</p><p>Oh God, no, said Bobbi. Frances writes everything. I don&#x2019;t even help.</p><p>That&#x2019;s not true, I said. That&#x2019;s not true, you do help. She&#x2019;s just saying that.</p><p>Melissa cocked her head to the side and gave a kind of laugh.</p><p>Alright, so, which one of you is lying? she said.</p><p>I was lying. Except in the sense of enriching my life, Bob- bi didn&#x2019;t help me write the poetry. As far as I knew she had never written creatively at all. She liked to perform dramatic monologues and sing anti-war ballads.

She lives in southern Wisconsin.Poor grammar, weak imagery and rickety old plots dressed up as Matters of Import doom this series of novellas, a continuation of Weis and Hickman's popular Dragon Lance series. As before, the protagonists are heroic; the revelation here is that the evil forces (who lost the War of the Lance some 20 years ago) are now organizing themselves into The Knights of Takhisis and employing the tactics once used to defeat them. They will be led, or not, by Steel Brightblade (the son of Kitiara, a disciple of evil in the last war) and Sturm (the hero in the last war). Action focuses on uninspired tales of Caramon Majere's son Palin's quest to be a wizard and political unrest among the Elves, which threatens the possibility of hegemony. There's hardly any suspense since contrivances make it clear that the eventual victory will be by authorial fiat.

Renowned for her work on the psychology of women and family relationships, she served as a staff psychologist at the Menninger Clinic for more than two decades. A distinguished lecturer, workshop leader, and psychotherapist, she is the author of <em>The Dance of Anger</em> and other bestselling books. She is also, with her sister, an award-winning children's book writer. She and her husband are therapists in Lawrence, Kansas, and have two sons.</p>This sensible self-help book draws on family-systems therapy in recommending thoughtful "self-focus" for women stuck in difficult relationships with either mates or families. Emphasizing that "a truly intimate relationship is one in which we can be who we are, which means being open about ourselves," Lerner ( The Dance of Anger ; Women in Therapy ) highlights the importance of women defining themselves, their needs and limits, rather than reacting to anxiety unthinkingly--either by emotionally distancing themselves from problems or by overreacting. A staff psychologist and psychotherapist at the Menninger Clinic, Lerner illustrates her points with case studies from her family as well as her practice. To explore what unhelpful patterns of behavior may be passed down from past generations, she advises creating a genogram, or family diagram, going back to a person's grandparents or earlier. Lerner's book presumes at least an acquaintance with professional jargon but should be accessible to most readers of pop psychology. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Myth of Progress: Toward a Sustainable Future</h2><p>In this compelling and cogently argued book, Tom Wessels demonstrates how our current path toward progress, based on continual economic expansion and inefficient use of resources, runs absolutely contrary to three foundational scientific laws that govern all complex natural systems. It is a myth, he contends, that progress depends on a growing economy.<br><br>Wessels explains his theory with his three Laws of Sustainability: (1) the law of limits to growth, (2) the second law of thermodynamics, which exposes the dangers of increased energy consumption, and (3) the law of self-organization, which results in the marvelous diversity of such highly evolved systems as the human body and complex ecosystems. These laws, scientifically proven to sustain life in its myriad forms, have been cast aside since the eighteenth century, first by western economists, political pragmatists, and governments attracted by the idea of unlimited growth, and more recently by a global economy dominated by large corporations, in which consolidation and oversimplification create large-scale inefficiencies in material and energy usage.<br><br>Wessels makes scientific theory readily accessible by offering examples of how the Laws of Sustainability function in the complex systems we can observe in the natural world around us. He shows how systems such as forests can be templates for developing sustainable economic practices that will allow true progress. Demonstrating that all environmental problems have their source in the Myth of Progress's disregard for the Laws of Sustainability, he concludes with an impassioned argument for cultural change.</p><p>TOM WESSELS is a professor of ecology and the founding director of the Master&#39;s degree program in Conservation Biology at Antioch New England Graduate School. His books include Untamed Vermont (Thistle Hill Publications, distributed by UPNE, 2003), The Granite Landscape: A Natural History of America&#39;s Mountain Domes from Acadia to Yosemite (2001), and Reading the Forested Landscape: A Natural History of New England (1997)."Wessels writes that people with a richness of life created through their connections with community, place and themselves have no need to compulsively consume the "frivolous accoutrements that we tend to think of as making us happy, but which really don't." Wessels' wisdom in The Myth of Progress provides much more than just a warning about the damage we are doing to our biosphere. It also helps us to see the damage we may be doing to our very souls."--People's Voice Magazine<br><br>"This is a short, often pithy book, and you can easily read it in a evening. In this way, it serves multiple purposes. It is a fine refresher or overview for people who are either new to this material or who haven't thought about it in a long time. It's perfect for folks who lack a science background and wish to better understand the relationship between ecological and economic systems. It is a valuable teaching tool that covers these basic principles in a simple, no-nonsense way. Most importantly, it retains all of Wessel's charm as a writer and educator. Indeed, the book's most riveting passages are his anecdotes and examples . . . This is an impassioned, critical, and bold book. Wessels is guided by his overwhelming sense that the laws of sustainability demand respect, understanding, and interpretation, and unless we educate ourselves about their full complexity and truth, we will do irreparable damage to the landscapes we love."--Northern Woodlands<br><br>"In this extended essay on sustainable development, Wessels challenges a conventional understanding of economic progress by posing a series of dichotomous worldviews, including linear versus complex systems and unfettered growth versus sustainability. . . . An interesting and challenging overview of environmental concerns, the book provides a sober and thoughtful . . . look at a serious long-term issue. Recommended."--Choice</p><h2>The Future of Life</h2><p>Our world is far richer than previously conceived, yet so ravaged by human activity that half its species could be gone by the end of the present century. These two contrasting themes--unexpected magnificence and underestimated peril--have originated during the past two decades of research. In this timely and important new book, one of our greatest living scientists describes exactly what treasures of the natural world we are about to lose forever and what we can do right now to save them. Destruction of natural habitats, the rampant spread of invasive species, pollution, uncontrolled population growth and overharvesting are the main threats to our natural world. Wilson explains how each of these elements works to undo the web of life that supports us, and why it is in our best interests to stop it. THE FUTURE OF LIFE is a magisterial accomplishment - both a moving description of the world&#39;s astonishing animals and plants and a guidebook for the protection of all its species, including our own.</p><p>The eminent Harvard naturalist and Pulitzer Prize winner Edward Wilson marshals all the prodigious powers of his intellect and imagination in this impassioned call to ensure the future of life. Opening with an imagined conversation with Henry David Thoreau at Walden Pond, he writes that he has come "to explain to you, and in reality to others and not least to myself, what has happened to the world we both have loved." Based on a love affair with the natural world that spans 70 years, Wilson combines lyrical descriptions with dire warnings and remarkable stories of flora and fauna on the edge of extinction with hard economics. How many species are we really losing? Is environmentalism truly contrary to economic development? And how can we save the planet? Wilson has penned an eloquent plea for the need for a global land ethic and offers the strategies necessary to ensure life on earth based on foresight, moral courage, and the best tools that science and technology can provide. <i>-- Lesley Reed</i>&#x201c;Wilson, perhaps our greatest living scientist . . . offers the most powerful indictment yet of humanity as destroyer.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> <i>Observer<br><br></i>&#x201c;His book eloquently makes one thing clear: . . . we know what we do, and we have a choice.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The New York Times Book Review<br><br></i>&#x201c;<b>The Future of Life</b> makes it clear once again that Wilson is one of our most gifted science writers.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>&#x201c;[An] elegant manifesto. . . .

For forty-five years, her fiction has lived and breathed with the rhythms and people of the Appalachian South. But never before has she written her own story.<br><br> Set deep in the mountains of Virginia, the Grundy of Lee Smith&#x2019;s youth was a place of coal miners, tent revivals, mountain music, drive-in theaters, and her daddy&#x2019;s dimestore. It was in that dimestore--listening to customers and inventing adventures for the store&#x2019;s dolls--that she became a storyteller. Even when she was sent off to college to earn some &#x201c;culture,&#x201d; she understood that perhaps the richest culture she might ever know was the one she was driving away from--and it&#x2019;s a place that she never left behind.<br><br><i>Dimestore</i>&#x2019;s fifteen essays are crushingly honest, wise and perceptive, and superbly entertaining. Smith has created both a moving personal portrait and a testament to embracing one&#x2019;s heritage. It&#x2019;s also an inspiring story of the birth of a writer and a poignant look at a way of life that has all but vanished.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of March 2016:</strong> &#x201c;What is it about Appalachia that so captures the mind, echoes in the ear, and lodges in the heart?&#x201d; Lee Smith&#x2019;s memoir metes out the answer to that question, touching on the elusive substance of Southern culture which so fascinates those of us outside of it and has inspired an entire subgenre of writing. Some of her essays ring with the raucous sounds of bluegrass, others with the sweet smells of home cooking passed down through generations--but Smith also bucks small town propriety by exposing the mental illness that plagued her family and by describing her sometimes fraught journey to becoming a beloved novelist. <em>Dimestore</em> is a love letter to the people and places that made a writer out of a small town Southern girl, and to the love, heartbreak, and power of creating her own stories that came after. <em>--Seira Wilson</em><p>Born in the small coal-mining town of Grundy, Virginia, <b>Lee Smith </b>began writing stories at the age of nine and selling them for a nickel apiece.

Subjects: Dylan, Bob 1941-. Rock musicians - United States - Biography.</p><p>One would not anticipate a conventional memoir from Bob Dylan--indeed, one would not have foreseen an autobiography at all from the pen of the notoriously private legend. What <i>Chronicles: Volume 1</i> delivers is an odd but ultimately illuminating memoir that is as impulsive, eccentric, and inspired as Dylan's greatest music. <p> Eschewing chronology and skipping over most of the "highlights" that his many biographers have assigned him, Dylan drifts and rambles through his tale, amplifying a series of major and minor epiphanies. If you're interested in a behind-the-scenes look at his encounters with the Beatles, look elsewhere. Dylan describes the sensation of hearing the group's "Do You Want to Know a Secret" on the radio, but devotes far more ink to a Louisiana shopkeeper named Sun Pie, who tells him, "I think all the good in the world might already been done" and sells him a World's Greatest Grandpa bumper sticker. Dylan certainly sticks to his own agenda--a newspaper article about journeymen heavyweights Jerry Quarry and Jimmy Ellis and soul singer Joe Tex's appearance on <i>The Tonight Show</i> inspire heartfelt musings, and yet the 1963 assassination of John Kennedy prompts nary a word from the era's greatest protest singer.</p><p> For all the small revelations (it turns out he's been a big fan of Barry Goldwater, Mickey Rourke, and Ice-T), there are eye-opening disclosures, including his confession that a large portion of his recorded output was designed to alienate his audience and free him from the burden of being a "the voice of a generation." </p><p> Off the beaten path as it is, <i>Chronicles</i> is nevertheless an astonishing achievement. As revelatory in its own way as Blonde on Blonde or Highway 61 Revisited, it provides ephemeral insights into the mind one of the most significant artistic voices of the 20th century while creating a completely new set of mysteries. <i>--Steven Stolder</i></p>Born Robert Allen Zimmerman in 1941, Bob Dylan is without question one of the most influential figures in the history of popular music.</p><h2>Slugs</h2><p><i>Breakfast?

She even visited Buchenwald and other concentration camps within days of their liberation. After a shattering personal tragedy, she converted to Roman Catholicism, and became the first American woman to be appointed ambassador to a major foreign power. <i>&#x201c;La Luce,&#x201d;</i> as the Italians called her, was also a prolific journalist and magnetic public speaker, as well as a playwright, screenwriter, pioneer scuba diver, early experimenter in psychedelic drugs, and grande dame<i> </i>of the GOP in the Reagan era. Tempestuously married to Henry Luce, the powerful publisher of Time Inc., she endured his infidelities while pursuing her own, and remained a practiced vamp well into old age.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Price of Fame </i>begins in January 1943 with Clare&#x2019;s arrival on Capitol Hill as a newly elected Republican from Connecticut. The thirty-nine-year-old beauty attracted nationwide attention in a sensational maiden speech, attacking Vice President Henry Wallace&#x2019;s civil aviation proposals as &#x201c;globaloney.&#x201d; Although she irked President Franklin D. Roosevelt by slanging his New Deal as &#x201c;a dictatorial Bumbledom,&#x201d; she impressed his wife Eleanor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Revealing liberal propensities, she lobbied for relaxed immigration policies for Chinese, Indians, and displaced European Jews, as well as equal rights for women and blacks. Following Hiroshima, the legislator whom J. William Fulbright described as &#x201c;the smartest colleague I ever served with&#x201d; became a passionate advocate of nuclear arms control. But in 1946, she gave up her House seat, convinced that politics was &#x201c;the refuge of second-class minds.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> After a few seasons of proselytizing on the Catholic lecture circuit, Clare emerged as a formidable television personality, campaigning so spectacularly for the victorious Republican presidential candidate, Dwight D. Eisenhower, that he rewarded her with the Rome embassy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ambassador Luce took an uncompromising attitude toward Italy&#x2019;s Communist Party, the world&#x2019;s second largest, and skillfully helped settle the fraught Trieste crisis between Italy and Yugoslavia. She was then stricken by a mysterious case of&nbsp; poisoning that the CIA kept secret, suspecting a Communist plot to assassinate her. The full story, told here for the first time, reads like a detective novel.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Price of Fame </i>goes on to<i> </i>record the crowded later years of the Honorable Clare Boothe Luce, during which she strengthened her friendships with Winston Churchill, Somerset Maugham, John F. Kennedy, Evelyn Waugh, Lyndon Johnson, Salvador Dal�, Richard Nixon, William F. Buckley, the composer Carlos Ch�vez, Ronald Reagan, and countless other celebrities who, after Henry Luce&#x2019;s death, visited her lavish Honolulu retreat. In 1973, she was appointed by Nixon to the President&#x2019;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, a position she continued to hold in the Ford and Reagan administrations.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sylvia Jukes Morris is the only writer to have had complete access to Mrs. Luce&#x2019;s prodigious collection of public and private papers. In addition, she had unique access to her subject, whose death at eighty-four ended a life that for variety of accomplishment qualifies Clare Boothe Luce for the title of &#x201c;Woman of the Century.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Sylvia Jukes Morris </b>was born and educated in England, where she taught English literature before immigrating to America. She is the author of <i>Rage for Fame: The Ascent of Clare Boothe Luce</i> and <i>Edith Kermit Roosevelt: Portrait of a First Lady</i>. She<i> </i>lives in New York City and Kent, Connecticut, with her husband, the writer Edmund Morris.1<br><br>Delayed Entrance<br><br>He who would accomplish anything must learn to limit himself.<br><br>&#x2014;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe<br><br>Two dozen red roses and a contingent of Washington correspondents and photographers awaited the new Republican Congresswoman from Fairfield County, Connecticut, at Union Station on Monday, January 4, 1943. Clare Boothe Luce was by far the smartest, most famous, and most glamorous member of the House of Representatives&#x2014;the last quality not much evident elsewhere in the wartime capital.<br><br>When the cars of her express emptied onto the windy platform, twenty-two minutes late, a United Press man noted perplexedly, &#x201c;Mrs. Luce wasn&#x2019;t on it.&#x201d; Had Clare been coming only from New York, she might have chosen to take the next commuter special. But she was booked on the last leg of a journey from Los Angeles, where she had just finished a screenplay for 20th Century-Fox.<br><br>Aware that the thirty-nine-year-old Congresswoman had written four Broadway comedies&#x2014;three of them hits and made into movies&#x2014;the UP reporter suspected she might have pulled off an old theatrical trick, the incognito step from the wings, melting into the crowd in nondescript clothing. Also, as the wife of the publisher of Time, Life, and Fortune, Clare was media-savvy enough to know that the best way to attract press attention was to elude it. On a hunch, he called the swank Wardman Park Hotel, and asked to speak to Mrs. Henry Luce. A secretary answered, and professed not to know where her employer was.<br><br>Sure now that Clare had concealed her arrival, he complained that he and his colleagues were being given the brush-off. There followed a click as the secretary hung up.<br>Next morning, the elusive Representative called a press conference in her new quarters, suite 1631 on the sixth floor of the new House Office Building. Attendees were baffled as to how a freshman member of Congress had acquired such a coveted space, with its two entrances, ample reception hall, large office with private bathroom, and second office for three or more assistants, with enclosed &#x201c;lavabo.&#x201d;<br><br>Freshman or not, Clare knew how to operate on Capitol Hill. She was the stepdaughter of the late Representative Dr. Albert Elmer Austin, and had just won back the seat he had lost in 1940. She had often visited him in his cramped quarters in the old Cannon Building, and realized that they would not satisfy her fastidious standards. Throughout her life she had aimed for the best of everything, and usually gotten it. Hearing shortly after her election that a few suites were available, she had sent an aide to stand in line for this one, and beaten out seventy or so other applicants.<br><br>She arrived ten minutes late&#x2014;another coup de th��tre&#x2014;and faced a battery of flashbulbs and newsreel klieg lights. Her appearance touched off pandemonium. Photographers stood on tables and unpacked storage boxes, yelling for her attention: &#x201c;Just one more shot, please.&#x201d;<br><br>Female reporters seemed more irritated by Clare&#x2019;s tardiness than their male colleagues, as well as envious of her stylish beauty. Cool, slender, and immaculately groomed for her &#x201c;debut,&#x201d; she wore a red wool-crepe dress with deep pockets, and daisy-patterned gold-and-diamond earrings. Black velvet bows nestled in her blonde hair, upswept and softly waved above the brow. Her extraordinary translucent skin and blue eyes, shimmering with intelligence, invariably captivated men, as did her outsize personality and charm. Much of her seductiveness&#x2014;and success as a playwright&#x2014;came from her wit. &#x201c;The difference between an optimist and a pessimist,&#x201d; she would drawl, in cultivated tones harking back to private school, &#x201c;is that the pessimist is usually better informed.&#x201d;<br><br>She began by apologizing for having sneaked away from Union Station the day before. Claiming to have been four days without a change of clothes, she said that she had exited the last car and rushed to her hotel to freshen up for an evening appointment. In any case, she had assumed reporters on the platform were waiting for some labor officials on the same train.<br><br>Even the most hardened Washington pressmen were beguiled. One was overheard saying that there was &#x201c;no labor leader living who would interest him if Mrs. Luce were around.&#x201d; A barrage of questions followed. What were her views on taxation, women&#x2019;s rights, the war, and the GOP&#x2019;s election chances next year?<br><br>&#x201c;I hope to do what I can,&#x201d; Clare said. &#x201c;It might be little, or nothing, or much.&#x201d; Not wanting to sound flip, she added that voters in her district were &#x201c;interested in precisely the same things as other people&#x2014;gasoline rationing among them.&#x201d; Some issues she was not yet &#x201c;up on.&#x201d; But she had been an advocate of women&#x2019;s rights for some twenty-five years now, and vowed to continue fighting for them. As for her party, the GOP, its priorities must be to defeat President Franklin Roosevelt in 1944, and to win the war.<br><br>Never one for false modesty, Clare stated that since she had spent many months of the past three years reporting from both the East and West battlefronts, she felt qualified for a spot on the Foreign Affairs Committee.<br><br>&#x201c;Places on that committee are supposed to go to seasoned Congressmen,&#x201d; a reporter reminded her. Clare realized she had let her ambition show, and said lamely that she would of course abide by House rules.<br><br>&#x201c;When are you going to make your maiden speech?&#x201d; a voice shouted.<br><br>&#x201c;When I have something to say.&#x201d;<br><br>At this point a lobbyist for a dried-milk company, who had managed to infiltrate the room, asked if she would vote in favor of his product. She replied with a straight face that as yet, she had taken no position on the desiccation of anything.<br><br>The bedlam increased. Newsmen scrambled over wires. Somebody kicked an electric socket, causing a loud explosion. The room grew increasingly airless, but with her customary sangfroid, Clare began talking about her three weeks in Hollywood. She said she had worked on a script about the birth of modern China, called The 400 Million. The Red scare in that overpopulated country had been on her mind when she visited a state-of-the-art steel mill, set not in a town but amid the orange groves of Fontana, California.<br><br>&#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t there be more of this kind of thing?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;If we can move the factories to the farms and give our people some land to live on, most of their troubles will disappear. . . . Communism does not thrive when people are satisfied and happy.&#x201d; With a prod at the current administration, she asserted that &#x201c;little people&#x201d; deserved a better incentive to succeed in life &#x201c;than they are likely to get from the New Deal.&#x201d; Only capitalism was capable of satisfying the world&#x2019;s material, spiritual, and cultural aspirations.<br><br>Thus, on her first full day in Washington, Representative Luce touched on vital themes that would preoccupy her for the next four years: equal rights, foreign affairs, and democracy versus authoritarianism. With only ten minutes left before the Republican caucus was due to begin, she edged toward the door.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you going to hold regular press conferences?&#x201d; a woman called out.<br><br>&#x201c;I think not. In fact I know not. The answer is No. Period.&#x201d;<br>Clare rose early on Wednesday. Before leaving for the Hill, she went to the Wardman Park beauty shop. In the manner of one used to giving orders, she asked the proprietor to telephone her maid or chauffeur and tell them to bring her some reading material. After several calls, and irritated promptings from the Congresswoman, a package was delivered. Other customers looked on intrigued as Clare ordered coffee and a rye crisp. When told that the caf� served only toast, she said she would take that. But when it appeared, she waved it away and demanded a proper breakfast from room service. Soon a waiter appeared with a loaded table. Evidently she could be, in the words of one of her profilers, &#x201c;a lady with a whim of iron.&#x201d;<br><br>The scene, duly reported in a Washington gossip column, could have come from The Women, Clare&#x2019;s greatest Broadway success. Her script for that play, with its lacerating portraits of spoiled New York socialites in beauty and exercise salons, had given her a reputation for astringency. Few in the shop had ever seen such a fuss over food. Yet after the perfumed whirlwind had gone, they felt bereft, such was the force of her persona.<br>At noon, the 78th Congress of the United States convened. Clare again made a delayed entrance, this time from behind Speaker Sam Rayburn&#x2019;s platform, and slipped into her assigned seventh-row seat, fifth from the right aisle. The six other women on the floor&#x2014;five of them Republicans&#x2014;were already in place, dressed uniformly in black, corsages being their only splash of color. Clare thought them all frumps, except for Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, an unassuming, effective politician whom she admired. The others were Edith Nourse Rogers of Massachusetts, an advocate of programs for veterans; Frances P. Bolton, a fluffy-haired two-termer from Ohio; and Jessie Sumner of Illinois, a prim isolationist. From New York came a slim lawyer, Winifred Stanley, six years younger than Clare but prematurely gray. The sole Democrat, senior to all of them, was New Jersey&#x2019;s Mary T. Norton. Her party held a working majority of 222, compared with 209 Republicans, 3 Progressives, and 1 Labor member.<br><br>In contrast with her soberly clad peers, Clare dazzled in a custom-made, form fitting purple dress. Her black-and-blue-striped ascot matched her hair bows, clipped atop two golden coronet braids. Flat-heeled black shoes supported her regal five-foot-five frame. To observers in the visitors&#x2019; gallery, she looked like a leading lady, with her lustrous complexion, straight thick brows, discreetly remodeled nose, and pearly, slightly crooked teeth. Most enchanting of all were her ready smile and infectious laugh.<br><br>Other freshmen might have been awed by the presence of the President&#x2019;s wife in the visitors&#x2019; gallery, but Clare was not. Some years earlier, Mrs. Roosevelt had seen her satire Kiss the Boys Goodbye, and publicly predicted that &#x201c;Miss Boothe&#x201d; would become a first-class playwright someday, &#x201c;when the bitterness of the experiences which she has evidently had are completely out of her system.&#x201d; She had invited Clare to visit the White House for a talk. &#x201c;I think it would be pleasant for both of us.&#x201d; Later, at the war&#x2019;s onset, Clare had accompanied her husband to a private dinner with both Roosevelts. FDR had welcomed them as anti-isolationists and proponents of his Lend-Lease program, which made old American ships available to the embattled Royal Navy. He shared the anti-Nazi views that Time Inc. magazines had propounded many months before Pearl Harbor.<br><br>Few Congressmen looked happy that afternoon at having yet another woman invade their domain. On either side of the aisle, it was the most conservative House since the days of Herbert Hoover. However, the man to Clare&#x2019;s right shook hands with her, and the one on her left engaged her in a lengthy conversation.<br><br>Not wanting to miss anything of the opening ceremony, she took out a white handerkerchief and polished a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles. She seemed nervous, removing and chewing the glasses, folding and refolding a pamphlet in her lap. From time to time, she rested a cheek on one hand. Her reply of &#x201c;Present&#x201d; to the roll call was scarcely audible.<br>Though much of Clare&#x2019;s adult life could be seen as preparation for elective office, her origins were not auspicious. She had been born illegitimate in 1903, in an insalubrious part of New York City&#x2019;s Upper West Side, to William Franklin Boothe, a gifted violinist and former piano executive, who had come down in the world, and was reluctantly working as a patent-medicine salesman. Women found the handsome, clever, and athletic &#x201c;Billy&#x201d; irresistible. Son of a Baptist clergyman, he had forsaken his moralistic upbringing and drifted into multiple liaisons and marriages. While still wedded to his second wife, he had met Anna Clara Schneider, a violet-eyed beauty less than half his age. The poor daughter of Bavarian Lutheran immigrants, she was no stranger to Manhattan saloons. In two successive years, 1902 and 1903, she had given her lover his only children, David Franklin and Ann Clare Boothe.<br><br>Clare had always found it hard to acknowledge, or even look into, the more obscure facts of her parents&#x2019; relationship. But apparently they never married. In 1907, William Boothe had taken his family first to Memphis and then to Nashville and Chicago, where he became a member of the Lyric Opera orchestra. But his musician&#x2019;s salary had not satisfied the luxury-loving Anna, and in 1913 she had left him and returned East with her son and daughter. Clare had seen her father only once after that. He was to die estranged from his children in 1928, eking out a living as a violin teacher in Los Angeles.<br><br>As the self-restyled &#x201c;Ann Snyder Boothe,&#x201d; Clare&#x2019;s mother had prospered in New York City from the largesse of lovers. The most generous of her gentleman callers was Joel Jacobs, a Jewish industrialist. He helped finance city apartments for her, as well as a summer house in Sound Beach, Connecticut, and paid the private school fees of both children. At age ten, in early evidence of theatrical talent, Clare had contributed to the family income by understudying Mary Pickford on Broadway, and two years later acted in an Edison silent movie, The Heart of a Waif.<br><br>In 1922, at age forty, Ann had married a Connecticut physician, Albert Elmer Austin&#x2014;the future Congressman whose seat Clare now occupied. Dr. Austin was not wealthy, to his stepdaughter&#x2019;s chagrin (&#x201c;Mother always told me to marry for money, but she didn&#x2019;t do it herself&#x201d;). But Jacobs had become part of the Austin m�nage, lavishing jewelry on Ann, escorting her to the racetracks, and playing pinochle with the doctor.<br><br>Clare, removed early from her father&#x2019;s academic and cultural influences, had acquired much of Ann&#x2019;s money mania, vampishness, and free attitude to sex. Some teenage trips to Europe had helped mitigate this dominance and nurture Clare&#x2019;s intellectual curiosity. Chatting to traveling diplomats confirmed the precocious penchant for politics she had shown in debates at the Castle School in Tarrytown, New York. Flirting with a White Russian spy interested her in the Bolshevik Revolution, and sparked a lifelong passion for espionage. Collecting mementos of World War I on the battlefields of northern France helped her understand the importance of military preparedness. She experienced at first hand the devaluation of the currency in Weimar Germany, which taught her the importance of national solvency. Her aptitude for the theater was fed by avant-garde performances of Wedekind plays in Berlin. On one homebound crossing, she had impressed the Austrian producer Max Reinhardt, who seriously considered casting her in his extravaganza The Miracle. The role went to Rosamond Pinchot, but her friendship with Reinhardt endured.</p><h2>Riding the Iron Rooster</h2><p>Paul Theroux invites you to join him on the journey of a lifetime, in the grand romanttic tradition, by train across Euope, through the vast underbelly of Asia and in the heart of Russia, and then up to China. Here is China by rail, as seen and heard through the eyes and ears of one of the most intrepid and insightful travel writers of our time.</p><p>Theroux (The Old Patagonian Express, The Great Railway Bazaar) spent a year exploring China by train, and his impressions about what has and has not changed in the country, as gathered in hundreds of conversations with Chinese citizens, make up a large portion of the book. The Cultural Revolution and the vandalism of the Red Guards have left scars on both the land and the people. Mao's death brought a collective sigh of relief from the population; reforms brought about under Deng Xiaoping have generally been welcomed. Still, this is not a political book. Whether describing his dealings with a rock-hard bureaucracy, musing over the Chinese flirtation with capitalismthey've "turned the free market into a flea market"or commenting on the process of traveling, Theroux conducts the reader through this enormous country with wisdom, humor and a crusty warmth. Along the way are anecdotes about classic Chinese pornography (forbidden to the citizenry, but all right for "foreign friends"); 35-below-zero weather; the Chinese penchant for restructuring nature; and the omnipresent thermos of hot water for making tea. The last chapter, "The Train to Tibet," deals with the extremes to which the Chinese have gone in their attempts to subjugate the Tibetan people. Theroux develops an understanding of China through his travels, but he falls in love with Tibet. As in his previous works, he gives the reader much to relish and think about. BOMC featured selection. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Theroux's penchant for train travel is well knownhis Great Railway Bazaar and The Old Patagonian Express are modern travel classics. On his latest jaunt he takes almost a year to crisscross China, traveling on 40 trains from the southern tropics to the wastelands of the Gobi in western Xinjiang to the dense metropolises of Shanghai, Beijing, and Canton. What emerges is a curious melange of ancient and modern: while some things are literally changing overnight, the Chinese still manufacture spittoons and steam engines. For Theroux, traveling is both about peopletheir thoughts, customs, and peculiaritiesand a form of autobiography, and here we learn as much about his own quirks and fancies as we do about the intriguing world of contemporary China.

Edwards Award. She lives in Oregon.PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2014;The team that created the "Catwings" series (Scholastic) has collaborated on this pleasing meditation. Both the story and text are simple: a cat's dreams are filled with kibble and cream, scaring away dogs, and climbing catnip trees. But when the dream turns nightmarish by a flock of squawking blue jays, the reality of a warm lap nearby is even better. <i>Cat Dreams</i> offers a satisfying read for cat lovers who can enjoy the tranquil illustrations, rendered in watercolor and gouache. Many of the elements of the animal's dream&#x2014;a day when it rains mice, sleeping in a blue jay's nest&#x2014;are revealed in the squares of the quilt on which the feline lies with such cozy charm (observant readers should also look out for a few catwings flying by). But the highlight of the book is the reinforcement of the conceit that humans somehow enrich a cat's life. The rhyming text is concise and easy enough for emerging readers.

"It was," they admit sadly, "an inside job." <p> Why, at the end of the 20th century, should we give a hoot in the first place about a brutal, misogynist society that rose to greatness on the back of slaves? Because, they argue, it <i>was</i> the first place; for all the faults of ancient Greece, the seeds of what Western civilization is today were planted there. "What we mean by Greek wisdom," they explain, "is that at the very beginning of Western culture the Greeks provided a blueprint for an ordered and humane society that could transcend time and space, one whose spirit and core values could evolve, sustain, and drive political reform and social change for ages hence." </p><p> But Hanson and Heath are not content to simply make a fiery, articulate case for what's <i>right</i> about understanding this particular ancient civilization in a contemporary world where more and more non-Western societies openly seek to embrace the democratic spirit. They go on to launch a deliciously vituperative jeremiad on what's <i>wrong</i> with the priorities of those entrusted with passing on this wisdom. Classics departments, as portrayed in <i>Who Killed Homer?</i>, appear to be filled with politically correct, insecure footnote fawners who, steeped in minutiae, miss the Big Picture. Hanson and Heath have a plan, sure to raise the hackles of tenured professors, for reviving classical studies that emphasizes the importance of teaching, communicating, and popularizing over publishing arcane monographs in journals not even the writer's family will ever read, insisting that the alternative--the extinction of a vivid intellectual pursuit--borders on cultural suicide. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist at California State University.</p><h2>Psychological Commentaries on the Teaching of Gurdjieff &amp; Ouspensky (Vol. 4)</h2><p>Discusses how to apply the philosophical and psychological principles of Georges Gurdjieff and P.D.

Until recently historians often dismissed these descriptions as elaborate fictions created by judicial interrogators eager to find evidence of stereotypical pacts with the Devil. Although this paradigm is now routinely questioned, and most historians acknowledge that there was a folkloric component to familiar lore in the period, these beliefs and the experiences reportedly associated with them, remain substantially unexamined. Cunning-Folk and Familiar Spirits examines the folkloric roots of familiar lore from historical, anthropological and comparative religious perspectives. It argues that beliefs about witches&#39; familiars were rooted in beliefs surrounding the use of fairy familiars by beneficent magical practitioners or &#39;cunning folk&#39;, and corroborates this through a comparative analysis of familiar beliefs found in traditional native American and Siberian shamanism. The author explores the experiential dimension of familiar lore by drawing parallels between early modern familiar encounters and visionary mysticism as it appears in both tribal shamanism and medieval European contemplative traditions. These perspectives challenge the reductionist view of popular magic in early modern British often presented by historians.</p><p><b>Emma Wilby</b> is an honorary fellow at the University of Exeter.<p>&#x201c;Wilby&#x2019;s thesis is that the image of the familiar spirit is not an elite fiction imposed by prosecutors, but represents the folk beliefs of magical practitioners&#x2014;cunning folk who practiced beneficent magic, and witches who were more malevolent. She goes further, arguing that the concept of the witch&#x2019;s familiar derives from ancient British animistic religion. . . . Wilby points out, correctly, that we do not think of cunning folk as mystics because they do not conform to the pious and ascetic norms established by Christian saints. The book is carefully organized and clearly written.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014;Moira Smith, <i>Journal of Folklore Research</i><br><br></p><p>&#x201c;Emma Wilby examines in abundant detail the statements in which witches and cunning folk described their encounters with spirits . . . [and] argues that these statements . . . are evidence of archaic animistic beliefs persisting into early modern times; occasionally, they hint at experiences of religious intensity comparable not merely with shamanism, but with the visions of medieval Christian mystics. This is bold stuff . . . Emma Wilby&#x2019;s views challenge those of other current historians, notably Owen Davies, who sees cunning folk as far more pragmatic and down-to-earth, and Diane Purkiss, who interprets the encounters of witches with fairies as compensatory psychological fantasies. The debate between these and other scholars will be very instructive.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014;Jacqueline Simpson, <i>Folklore</i><br><br></p><p>&#x201c;Wilby&#x2019;s book is fascinating and well researched. It is a genuine contribution to what is known about cunning folk and lays very solid foundations for future work on the subject.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014;Brian Hoggard, <i>White Dragon </i><br><br></p><p>&#x201c;Wilby valuably sets the ground for further exploration of the role and character of folk magic within community and tradition and is to be recommended for that.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014;John Billings, <i>Northern Earth</i></p></p><h2>Cognitive Psychology: Theory, Process, and Methodology</h2><p><p><strong>Cognitive Psychology</strong> is a student-friendly text that introduces cognitive psychology&#x2019;s main topics by demonstrating how cognitive processes have been and continue to be studied by researchers.

Feel the warmth of it, the joy of it, and the freedom that comes with it. Love is an inner state of being. It does not have to be talked about, for it expresses itself in a thousand and one little ways: a look, a touch, an action. Love is everywhere, but you have to be aware of it to appreciate it fully. The air you breathe is everywhere, but you take it all for granted unless you stop and become aware of it and of the fact that it keeps you alive. Take nothing for granted, for when you do, it takes all the joy and sparkle out of life. Love starts with small beginnings and grows and grows. When you truly love one another, you have faith and trust in each other. Keep that love flowing and let nothing stand in the way. Let My divine love flow through everything, and know that peace which passes all understanding. <br><br><b>April 3</b> <br><br>The key to your happiness and contentment lies deep within you, within your own heart and mind. The way you start each day is very important; you can start off on the right foot or the wrong one. You can wake up with a song of joy and gratitude in your heart for the new day, for being alive, for the very wonder of living, and for being in tune and harmony with the rhythm of all life. You can expect the very best from the coming day, and therefore draw it to you. Or you can start the day with a chip on your shoulder, disgruntled and out of rhythm. You are responsible for what today will bring, and knowing it gives you an even greater responsibility than those souls who are not aware of it and therefore know no better. You cannot blame your state of mind on anyone else. It all rests with you. <br><br><b>June 26</b> <br><br>Once a chick has emerged from its shell or a butterfly from its chrysalis, there is no going back, but there is a continuous unfolding into the new. Let the action of unfolding be a day-by-day, hour-by-hour, minute-by-minute process for you. Feel the excitement and expectancy in all that is taking place. There is never a dull moment in this life when you keep on your toes; there is always something happening. Let it happen and never try to hold up progress, but go along with it all. I tell you, all that unfolds will be for the very best and for the growth and benefit of the whole. Find that perfect rhythm in life and give of your very best to it. Flow with it, not against it, for only in this way will you find peace of heart and mind; and when you are at peace within, you are open and ready for the new to unfold. <br><br><b>August 2</b> <br><br>Learn to act spontaneously, to act by intuition, and to do what your heart prompts you to do, not just what your mind tells you is reasonable or sensible. Some acts of pure love may appear to be very unreasonable, even foolish, in the eyes of others but it matters not. When you are prompted to act, do so and do not stop to weigh it up or even wonder why you are doing it. That small act of love may have some very far-reaching effect. It may not even reveal itself to begin with. Do not waste time looking for results; simply do what you know you must do, and then leave the rest to Me. Sometimes it may take a long time for that seed of love to germinate in a hard, cold heart, but once it has been planted, sooner or later it will show itself. All you have to do is to do your part in faith, and know that all is very, very well. <br><br><b>November 16</b> <br><br>The primary lesson to learn in life is to love. Love is so strong that it is unbreakable and yet it is intangible. You can know it; you can feel it; and yet you cannot hold on to it; for as soon as you try, it will slip away like quicksilver. Love cannot be possessed; it is as free as the wind and moves where it will. Move with it. Love is unity and wholeness. Love knows no limitation, no barriers. With love comes freedom. It is fear that binds and limits a soul; it is love that frees and cuts away all bonds. Love opens all doors, changes lives and melts the hardest of hearts. Love is creative; it builds up, creating beauty, harmony and oneness. It works for, not against, anything. Love brings such joy that it cannot be repressed. It dances and sings through life. Is there love in your heart? Love for each other? It starts in you and works out and out.</p><h2>Career Development Interventions in the 21st Century, 4th Edition (Interventions that Work)</h2><p><p> <b>Note: This is the bound book only and does not include access to MyCounselingLab�.

Doing so requires us to live alert, listening for &#x201c;heart drops,&#x201d; hints from those in our lives who need a helping hand or a generous dose of encouragement. Living alert lifts our own spirits, showing us that blessing others blesses us even more.</p><p><em>Listen, Love, Repeat</em> offers biblical teaching and suggests doable actions that are simple, heart-tugging, sentimental, even sneaky and hilarious. This message:</p><p>� Presents scriptural examples of those who lived alert, including Jesus, who noticed those who least expected to be seen.</p><p>� Explains the role of good works for followers of Christ. They aren&#x2019;t our ticket to heaven but they are our marching orders on earth.</p><p>� Gives creative ideas for showing love to friends and family, and suggests practical ways to reach out to the lonely, the marginalized, the outcast, and the odd duck. Additionally, it helps you comfort the grieving, showing what you can do when you don&#x2019;t know what to say.</p><p>� Provides inspiration for blessing the &#x201c;necessary people&#x201d; in your life, those often-overlooked souls who help you get life done every day, and teaches you how to hug a porcupine by genuinely loving the hard-to-love.</p><p>As we scatter love, we create a safe space where we can openly share the gospel. We get to see lives changed right before our eyes. Most importantly, <em>Listen, Love, Repeat</em> will enable you to live a life that is full of kind deeds, not to selfishly shout, &#x201c;Hey! Look at me!&#x201d; but to humbly implore, &#x201c;Will you look at Him?&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Karen Ehman is a Proverbs 31 Ministries speaker, a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, and a writer for First 5, a Bible study app that reaches over 2 million people daily.

Now, in this third edition, Jay M. Feinman offers a fully updated survey of American law that incorporates fresh material on 2009 Supreme Court cases, the legal response to the war on terror (including the Guantanamo detainees and electronic surveillance), and to the latest developments in Internet law. <br><br>In a book brimming with legal puzzles, interesting anecdotes, and thought-provoking questions, Jay M. Feinman's clear introduction to the law provides us with a solid understanding of the American legal tradition and covers the main subjects taught in the first year of law school. Readers are introduced to every aspect of the legal system, from constitutional law and the litigation process to tort law, contract law, property law, and criminal law. Feinman illuminates each discussion with many intriguing, outrageous, and infamous cases, from the scalding coffee case that cost McDonald's half a million dollars, to the sensational murder trial in Victorian London that led to the legal definition of insanity, to the epochal decision in <em>Marbury v. Madison </em>that gave the Supreme Court the power to declare state and federal law unconstitutional. He broadens the reader's legal vocabulary, clarifying the meaning of everything from "due process" and "equal protection" in constitutional law to the distinction between "murder" and "manslaughter" in criminal law. Perhaps most important, we learn that though the law is voluminous and complex, it is accessible to all. <br><br>Everyone who wants a better grasp of current legal issues--from students contemplating law school, to journalists covering the legislature or the courts, to fans of Court TV--will find here a wonderful source of information: a complete, clear, and colorful map of the American legal system.</p><p><br><strong>Jay M. Feinman </strong>serves as Distinguished Professor of Law at Rutgers University School of Law, Camden. He is the author of five previous books, including <em>1001 Legal Words </em>and <em>Un-Making Law: The Conservative Campaign to Roll Back the Common Law.</em><br>&#34;An engaging introduction to just about every aspect of law.&#34;--The American Lawyer &#34;All the benefits of that first year of law school without the tedium, the terror, and the sleep deprivation...These legal lessons are presented in a style nearly always engaging and very often humorous.&#34;--Jurist &#34;An entertaining and informative introduction to the law...For journalists, those interested in the law, and fans of television law dramas, this book should be required reading.&#34;--Library Journal &#34;A layperson&#39;s introduction to the legal subjects that assault every first-year law student. From constitutional law to contracts to Dickensian procedures that guide civil suites, the book gives an approachable overview of the cases and concepts that combine to form our legal system.&#34;--NewarkStar-Ledger &#34;Though a book is aimed at laypersons, it offers a good refresher course to update legal practitioners and paraprofessionals in areas where they do not specialize. A good read overall for those interested in the law.&#34;--Booklist &#34;Law 101 attempts to teach you how to think like a lawyer--without requiring that you dedicate three years and tens of thousands of dollars to the task. The result? A practical book that is also a pleasure to read.&#34;--The Trenton Times &#34;This basic text offers nonlawyers a concise, accessible overview of topics typically introduced in the first year of law school. Feinman, a law professor at Rutgers, cites seminal cases to highlight key concepts in the fields of constitutional law, civil procedure, torts, contracts, property, criminal law and criminal procedure. He does not minimize the actual complexity of these subjects, conceding variously that contract law has &#34;tormented the most students,&#34; property law &#34;most irritates students,&#34; conflicts of law &#34;tortures students&#34; and civil procedure is &#34;the most alien.&#34; Nevertheless, he distinguishes his book from the various how-to-be-your-own-lawyer manuals on the market: &#39;This one is fun to read.&#39; ...But many readers, particularly those contemplating law school, will find this a painless introduction to American legal theory and practice.&#34;--Publishers Weekly (Praise for the Second Edition) &#34;Many readers, particularly those contemplating law school, will find this a painless introduction to American legal theory and practice.&#34;--Publishers Weekly &#34;Feinman&#39;s style makes for easy reading, and Law101 is chock full of analyses, anecdotes, examples, questions, and legal reasoning set out in lay terms. Overall, the book provides an excellent explanation of what American law is, and it frequently suggests ways in which it might be improved.&#34;--TheFederal Lawyer</p><h2>Analytical Greek New Testament (Including Greek Text Analysis) (Baker&#39;s Greek New Testament Library, 1) (English and Greek Edition)</h2><p>This Analytical Greek New Testament covers Koine Creek morphology and syntax.

Evans takes readers inside the nexus of southern and Jewish histories, from the earliest immigrants to the present day. Evoking the rhythms and heartbeat of Jewish life in the Bible belt, Evans weaves together chapters of recollections from his youth and early years in North Carolina with chapters that explore the experiences of Jews in cities and small towns across the South. He presents the stories of communities, individuals, and events in this quintessential American landscape that reveal the deeply intertwined strands of what he calls a unique "Southern Jewish consciousness." <p>First published in 1973 and updated in 1997, <i>The Provincials</i> was the first book to take readers on a journey into the soul of the Jewish South, using autobiography, storytelling, and interpretive history to create a complete portrait of Jewish contributions to the history of the region. No other book on this subject combines elements of both memoir and history in such a compelling way. This new edition includes a gallery of more than two dozen family and historical photographs as well as a new introduction by the author.</p></p><p>"[A] spell-binding portrait of growing up in the South during the last century. . . . [An] absolute must for anyone who wants to understand something of the history of the South."-- Durham <i>Herald Sun</i> <br>In this classic portrait of Jews in the South, Evans takes readers inside the nexus between southern and Jewish histories from the earliest immigrants to the present day, weaving together chapters on recollections from his youth with chapters exploring the experiences of Jews in a number of southern cities. This new edition includes a gallery of family and historical photos as well as a new introduction by the author.</p><h2>Home and Work: Housework, Wages, and the Ideology of Labor in the Early Republic</h2><p>Over the course of a two hundred year period, women's domestic labor gradually lost its footing as a recognized aspect of economic life in America. The image of the colonial "goodwife," valued for her contribution to household prosperity, had been replaced by the image of a "dependent" and a "non-producer." This book is a history of housework in the United States prior to the Civil War. More particularly, it is a history of women's unpaid domestic labor in the context of the emergence of an industrialized society in the northern United States. Boydston argues that just as a capitalist economic order had first to teach that wages were the measure of a man's worth, it had at the same time, implicitly or explicitly, to teach that those who did not draw wages were dependent and not essential to the "real economy." Developing a striking account of the gender and labor systems that characterized industrializing America, Boydston explains how this effected the devaluation of women's unpaid labor.<br></p><p>Jeanne Boydston is at University of Wisconsin, Madison.<br>"A provocative analysis of women's long-ignored economic activity in the Early Republic and the rhetorics that surrounded it. Ideal for undergraduate courses in women's and labor history and essential for graduate students in American history."--Philip Scranton, <em>Rutgers University</em><p></p><br>"Boydston's thoughtful, stimulating, and carefully researched study has taken us a large step forward in our understanding of the history of early American women's work."--<em>Journal of Economic History</em><p></p><br>"Boydston's focus on women's unpaid labor in the home within the broad context of changes in the antebellum northern economy sets her work off from a myriad of other books....Boydston has achieved a goal that many women's historians strive toward: she has demonstrated that only through examining the 'women's sphere' in its most classic sense can we understand the shape of American history in the antebellum years."--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Boydston, in her quiet, analytical way, delivers suggestive or unconventional ideas at about one per page....Brief, brilliantly complex, consistently engaging, her book will influence scholars of the subject for years to come."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"Boydston's study of housework stands out in the recent and growing literature on the subject for the details she provides, but more so for the profound questions she raises about the valuing of labor."--<em>Pennslyvania Magazine of History and Biography</em><p></p><br>"Boydston makes ambitious arguments that are predicted on a belief in a changing ideology."--<em>Journal Of The Early Republic</em><p></p><br>"This valuable study...provides a useful vehicle for assessing how the field has evolved in the United States since the end of the 1960's."--<em>International Review of Social History</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Ecotechnic Future: Envisioning a Post-Peak World</h2><p><p><b> How to survive and thrive in the post-industrial age </b></p><p> In response to the coming impact of peak oil, John Michael Greer helps us envision the transition from an industrial society to a sustainable ecotechnic world-not returning to the past, but creating a society that supports relatively advanced technology on a sustainable resource base. </p><p> Fusing human ecology and history, this book challenges assumptions held by mainstream and alternative thinkers about the evolution of human societies. Human societies, like ecosystems, evolve in complex and unpredictable ways, making it futile to try to impose rigid ideological forms on the patterns of evolutionary change. Instead, social change must explore many pathways over which we have no control. The troubling and exhilarating prospect of an open-ended future, he proposes, requires dissensus-a deliberate acceptance of radical diversity that widens the range of potential approaches to infinity. </p><p> Written in three parts, the book places the present crisis of the industrial world in its historical and ecological context in part one; part two explores the toolkit for Ecotechnic Age, and part three opens a door to the complexity of future visions. </p><p> For anyone concerned about peak oil and the future of the industrial society, this book provides a solid analysis of how we got to where we are, and a practical toolkit to prepare for the future. </p></p><p><p> How to survive and thrive in the post-industrial age </p><blockquote><p><i> Greer's work is nothing short of brilliant. ... entertaining, illuminating, and practically informative. Not to be missed. </i><br> Richard Heinberg, Senior Fellow, Post Carbon Institute, and author of <i> Peak Everything </i></p></blockquote><p> As peak oil reshapes the terrain of our future, John Michael Greer offers an inspiring vision of cultural evolution rooted in environmental science. Human societies are ecosystems, subject to the same rules as other living communities, and follow trajectories of change over which we have no control. </p><p> The crisis of the industrial world can be seen as the first stage in a complex and challenging transition that leads, not back to past social patterns, but forward to a new kind of human ecology -- the ecotechnic societies of the far future -- that can support relatively advanced technologies on a sustainable resource base. </p><p><i> The Ecotechnic Future </i> prepares us for the long transition to the ecotechnic age by offering: </p><ul><li> a compelling exploration of the future taking shape ahead of us, </li><li> a useful guide to the tools and resources needed to navigate the transition, and </li><li> a vision of the open-ended possibilities of a world we are called upon to create. </li></ul><p> For anyone concerned about peak oil and the future of industrial society, this book is an essential guide to the deep patterns of change wracking the world today, and a practical toolkit for building a sustainable future. </p><blockquote><p><i> Greer brilliantly inspires us to ... construct local communities which concretely exemplify [his] comprehensive vision of a post-industrial milieu. </i><br> -- Carolyn Baker, author of <i> Sacred Demise: Walking The Spiritual Path of Industrial Civilization's Collapse </i> , and publisher/editor, <i> Speaking Truth to Power </i> (CarolynBaker.net) </p></blockquote><p><b> John Michael Greer </b> is a certified Master Conserver, organic gardener, and scholar of ecological history.

The facts of his life, known from surviving documents, are sparse. He was one of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a merchant of some standing in his community. William probably went to the King&#x2019;s New School in Stratford, but he had no university education. In November 1582, at the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior, who was pregnant with their first child, Susanna. She was born on May 26, 1583. Twins, a boy, Hamnet ( who would die at age eleven), and a girl, Judith, were born in 1585. By 1592 Shakespeare had gone to London working as an actor and already known as a playwright. A rival dramatist, Robert Greene, referred to him as &#x201c;an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers.&#x201d; Shakespeare became a principal shareholder and playwright of the successful acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men (later under James I, called the King&#x2019;s Men). In 1599 the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men built and occupied the Globe Theater in Southwark near the Thames River. Here many of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were performed by the most famous actors of his time, including Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, and Robert Armin. In addition to his 37 plays, Shakespeare had a hand in others, including <i>Sir Thomas More</i> and <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, and he wrote poems, including <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and <i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>. His 154 sonnets were published, probably without his authorization, in 1609. In 1611 or 1612 he gave up his lodgings in London and devoted more and more time to retirement in Stratford, though he continued writing such plays as <b>The Tempest</b> and <b>Henry VII</b> until about 1613. He died on April 23 1616, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford. No collected edition of his plays was published during his life-time, but in 1623 two members of his acting company, John Heminges and Henry Condell, put together the great collection now called the First Folio.Chapter 1<br><br>list of parts<br><br>RICHARD, Duke of Gloucester, later King RICHARD III<br>Duke of CLARENCE, his brother<br>Duke of BUCKINGHAM<br>Lord HASTINGS, the Lord Chamberlain<br>Sir William CATESBY<br>Sir Richard RATCLIFFE<br>Lord LOVELL<br>BRACKENBURY, Lord Lieutenant of the Tower<br>Lord Stanley, Earl of DERBY (sometimes addressed as Derby and sometimes as Stanley, here given speech prefix Derby)<br>KING EDWARD IV, Gloucester's older brother<br>QUEEN ELIZABETH, his wife<br>PRINCE EDWARD, their older son<br>Duke of YORK, their younger son<br>Lord RIVERS, Elizabeth's brother<br>Lord GREY, Elizabeth's son by her first husband<br>Marquis of DORSET, his brother<br>Sir Thomas VAUGHAN<br>Lady ANNE, Widow of Edward, Prince of Wales, later Duchess of Gloucester<br>QUEEN MARGARET, widow of<br>Henry VI<br>DUCHESS OF YORK, mother to Gloucester, Clarence, Edward IV<br>BOY Clarence's<br>DAUGHTER children<br>Earl of RICHMOND, later King Henry VII<br>Earl of OXFORD<br>Sir JAMES BLUNT<br>Sir WALTER HERBERT<br>Sir WILLIAM BRANDON<br>Duke of NORFOLK<br>Earl of SURREY<br>CARDINAL, Archbishop of<br>Canterbury<br>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK<br>BISHOP OF ELY<br>SIR CHRISTOPHER, a priest<br>Sir John, a PRIEST<br>Lord MAYOR of London<br>Three CITIZENS<br>JAMES TYRRELL<br>Two MURDERERS<br>MESSENGERS<br>KEEPER<br>PURSUIVANT<br>PAGE<br>Ghost of KING HENRY VI<br>Ghost of EDWARD, his son<br>Two Bishops, Soldiers,<br>Halberdiers, Gentlemen, Lords, Citizens, Attendants<br><b>Act 1 Scene 1</b> <i>running scene 1<br></i><br><i>Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester, solus</i><br><br>RICHARD Now is the winter of our discontent<br>Made glorious summer by this son of York:<br>And all the clouds that loured upon our house<br>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.<br>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,<br>Our bruis�d arms hung up for monuments,<br>Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,<br>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.<br>Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front,<br>And now, instead of mounting barb�d steeds<br>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,<br>He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber<br>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.<br>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,<br>Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass:<br>I, that am rudely stamped, and want love's majesty<br>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph:<br>I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,<br>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,<br>Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time<br>Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,<br>And that so lamely and unfashionable<br>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them -<br>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,<br>Have no delight to pass away the time,<br>Unless to see my shadow in the sun<br>And descant on mine own deformity.<br>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,<br>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,<br>I am determin�d to prove a villain<br>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.<br>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,<br>By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,<br>To set my brother Clarence and the king<br>In deadly hate the one against the other.<br>And if King Edward be as true and just<br>As I am subtle, false and treacherous,<br>This day should Clarence closely be mewed up<br>About a prophecy, which says that 'G'<br>Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.<br>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here Clarence<br>comes.-<br><br><i>Enter Clarence, guarded, and Brackenbury</i><br><br>Brother, good day.

Sometimes we want to learn more about that wine. And sometimes we want to&nbsp;feel&nbsp;something about wine.<br><br>In&nbsp;<em>Vignette</em>, sommelier Jane Lopes recommends the 100 bottles of wine (and some spirits and beers) to best expand your wine journey, giving you a complete palate education of the important styles, grapes, regions, and flavors&nbsp;of this magical and ever-growing world. Alongside that, you will find imaginative ways to engage with the foundational wine knowledge that underpins a good drinking experience. And then there is Jane's own narrative &#x2013; the stories of&nbsp;triumph and defeat&nbsp;that&nbsp;comprise her&nbsp;life in wine. It's part memoir and part wine book, but a lot more fun than either alone.<br><br>These are wines to live with, learn from and take solace in &#x2013; a joyous, surprising, and revelatory response to that age-old question, "What should I drink?"</p><p>Jane Lopes is an American-born sommelier. She has worked at New York&#39;s Eleven Madison Park, Nashville&#39;s The Catbird Seat, and Chicago&#39;s The Violet Hour, and she is currently the wine director at Attica, Australia&#39;s most celebrated restaurant. In September of 2018, Jane passed the prestigious Master Sommelier exam, becoming the only woman in Australia to do so, and one of only 34 women in the world (and 274 people in total since the 1960s). Jane has finally put her University of Chicago literature degree to good use in publishing her first book.'This is such a unique and wonderful book. Jane invites you in, takes you on a journey, and before you know it, the journey has become yours. Along the way you'll drink many delicious things, learn a ton, have a boat load of fun, and, importantly, find your own truth about wine. Jane's story telling is clever, playful, and exceptionally well designed all of which renders the complex clear, quick, and intuitive. May we also say, Jane is one courageous human. It has been a pleasure to watch her grow as a professional. She's tackled the most daunting situations with aplomb, proving herself a person of true character and substance. She's one of the finest wine professionals in the world.' <b>-Richard Betts and Carla Rzeszewski</b><br><br>'Working with Jane in the dining room at Eleven Madison Park I got to see firsthand the incredible approach she took in talking with our guests about wine, almost tricking them into learning through her thoughtful and playful storytelling. In this exceptionally creative book, she does more of the same, bringing hospitality to the world of wine education by making it personal, fun and engaging to learn.' <b>-Will Guidara, Eleven Madison Park</b><br><br>'<i>Vignette</i> is an enthralling medley of education, emotion, and wonder. Through the lens of one of the world's most thoughtful (and accomplished) sommeliers, the reader not only learns about 100 classic wines but also grows a genuine attachment to them through Lopes' personal anecdotes. Whether a novice wine drinker or a master sommelier - you will love this book' <b>-Victoria James, sommelier and author of <i>Drink Pink: A Celebration of Ros�</i></b><br><br>'Seeing Jane in action in the dining rooms of Eleven Madison Park and Attica, it's no wonder why she is a world-wide force through wine. She has an ease, yet grace about her. This is her super power - her ability to invite you in, to adore an unassuming bottle, a story, a history, a vine, a craft through the simple ease of a single sip or a smile.' <b>-Christina Tosi, chef and owner Milk Bar, author</b><br><br>'Jane has written the most honest and accurate books I have read on life, love, and alcohol. Essential reading for anyone who drinks to learn.' <b>-Jason Wise, writer and director of <i>SOMM</i></b><br><br>'Jane Lopes is as brilliant an author as she is a sommelier. <i>Vignette</i> is a rare work of impassioned storytelling, love, vulnerability and regeneration that will inform, engage and delight any student of wine at any point in her or his journey. It is also a newly seminal educational wine book and must-read for anyone either looking to impress friends at dinner parties or pass a notoriously difficult exam.' <b>-Jordan Salcito, founder of Drink Ramona, sommelier</b><br><br>'In her brilliant, utterly personal book, Jane Lopes offers not only the knowledge of an expert sommelier, but also makes the reader realize wine that is a beautiful window to the world, inside and outside.' <b>-Pascaline Lepeltier, Master Sommelier, Best Sommelier of France, author and winemaker</b><br><br>'I'm certain by reading this book you'll learn to love wine - if you don't love it already - in the same way that I did: from Jane.

Written to help sleep-deprived parents of children ages one to five, <i>The No-Cry Sleep Solution for Toddlers and Preschoolers </i>offers loving solutions to help this active age-group get the rest they--and their parents--so desperately need.</p> <p>A follow-up to Elizabeth Pantley's megahit <i>The No-Cry Sleep Solution</i>, this breakthrough guide is written in Pantley's trademark gentle, child-centered style. Parents will discover a wellspring of positive approaches to help their children get to bed, stay in bed, and sleep all night, without having to resort to punishments or other negative and ineffective measures. <i>The No-Cry Sleep Solution for Toddlers and Preschoolers </i> tackles many common nighttime obstacles, including:</p> <ul> <li>Refusals to go to bed </li><li>Night waking and early rising </li><li>Reluctance to move out of the crib and into a big-kid bed </li><li>Nighttime visits to the parents' bed </li><li>Naptime problems </li><li>Nightmares, "night terrors," and fears </li><li>Special sleep issues of twins, special needs children, and adopted children </li><li>Sleepwalking, sleep talking, snoring, and tooth grinding </li></ul></p><p><p><b>Elizabeth Pantley</b> is the author of the parenting classic <i>The No-Cry Sleep Solution</i> as well as <i>Gentle Baby Care</i>, <i>Perfect Parenting</i>, <i>Hidden Messages</i>, and <i>Kid Cooperation</i>.

It provides answers to better sleep for &nbsp;children from the day of birth through toddlerhood. My youngest &nbsp;child was a very frequent night-waking, all-night breastfeeding-baby. My experience learning how to help him sleep all night was the incentive for me to write my first no-cry sleep book. Since then, I have corresponded with tens of &nbsp;thousands of parents, and I have expanded my research up through the preschool years to bring you this edition of The No-Cry Sleep Solution.<br><br>Because the magic of children is that they are all very different from one another, and that they are unique in their transitions from one stage of growth to the next, this edition of&nbsp;<em>The No-Cry Sleep Solution&nbsp;</em></i><em>crosses paths with the first for that in-between stage from baby to toddler. It then moves forward through the preschool years, and for many children, into the primary grades as well.<br>I hope to guide you along a gentle, peaceful journey to good sleep for everyone in your family.</em></p><h2>Albert Speer: His Battle With Truth</h2><p>With 24 pages of photographs</p><p>Gitta Sereny's biography meticulously re-creates for the reader the professional, emotional, and psychological life of Albert Speer, Hitler's architect and later his Minister of Armaments. Throughout the 12-year history of the Third Reich, Speer remained one of Hitler's most trusted confidants and one of the most powerful political leaders of the Nazi party. Researched and written over an eight year period, <i>Albert Speer</i> weaves together information from innumerable personal interviews with Speer, his family, close friends, and professional colleagues, the author's own solid grasp of German history, and critical readings of Speer's own writings, including various drafts of his memoirs, <i>Inside the Third Reich</i>, first published in 1969. <p> Throughout, Sereny consciously avoids the pitfall of many Speer biographers, who seek to either blame or exculpate Speer for the Nazi's atrocities. Instead, she succeeds in helping the reader understand a "morally extinguished" man and place into context "all the crimes against humanity which Hitler initiated, which continue to threaten us today, and of which Speer, who was in many ways a man of excellence, sadly enough made himself a part." Well over 700 pages, <i>Albert Speer</i> is not a quick read, but superbly written and meticulously researched, it is a pleasure to read, providing unprecedented insight into one of the most complex figures in modern German history. <i>--Bertina Loeffler</i></p>s of photographs</p><h2>The Figure in Motion: A Visual Reference for the Artist</h2><p>Photographs show male and female nudes leaping, bending, stretching, marching, dancing, and turning</p><p><b>Thomas Easely</b>, whose paintings are in many distinguished private collections, lives in South Lake Tahoe, California. <b>Mark Smith</b>, whose photographs appear in fine periodicals and travel books, is based in Venice, Italy.</p><h2>The Silver Way: Techniques, Tips, and Tutorials for Effective Character Design</h2><p>The Silver Way: Techniques, Tips and Tutorials for Effective Character Design by Stephen Silver offers invaluable instruction from one of best teachers in the industry.

Habermas takes up the challenge posed by the radical critique of reason in contemporary French poststructuralism. Tracing the odyssey of the philosophical discourse of modernity, Habermas's strategy is to return to those historical "crossroads" at which Hegel and the Young Hegelians, Nietzsche and Heidegger made the fateful decisions that led to this outcome. His aim is to identify and clearly mark out a road indicated but not taken: the determinate negation of subject-centered reason through the concept of communicative rationality. As The Theory of Communicative Action served to place this concept within the history of social theory, these lectures locate it within the history of philosophy. Habermas examines the odyssey of the philosophical discourse of modernity from Hegel through the present and tests his own ideas about the appropriate form of a postmodern discourse through dialogs with a broad range of past and present critics and theorists. The lectures on Georges Bataille, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Cornelius Castoriadis are of particular note since they are the first fruits of the recent cross-fertilization between French and German thought. Habermas's dialogue with Foucault&#x2015;begun in person as the first of these lectures were delivered in Paris in 1983 culminates here in two appreciative yet intensely argumentative lectures. His discussion of the literary-theoretical reception of Derrida in America&#x2015;launched at Cornell in 1984&#x2015;issues here in a long excursus on the genre distinction between philosophy and literature. The lectures were reworked for the final time in seminars at Boston College and first published in Germany in the fall of 1985. </p></p><p>These lectures constitute Jurgen Habermas&#39;s response to the challenge posed by the radical critique of reason in contemporary French poststructuralism.J�rgen Habermas is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of Frankfurt and Professor of Philosophy at Northwestern University. He was recently awarded the 2004 Kyoto Prize for Arts and Philosophy by the Inamori Foundation.

This C Level manual builds on material covered in The United States Pony Club Manual of Horsemanship: Basics for Beginners/D Level. Whether you are a Pony Clubber who has passed the D Level tests or simply a rider who has mastered the same basics, this manual will enable you to increase your skills and teach you what you must know in order to ride independently and correctly with good position, balance, and use of the aids on the flat, over fences, and in the open. At the intermediate level you are expected to take more responsibility for the care and management of your pony, and you will learn how to do this as well. In addition, you will learn the skills needed for conditioning and preparing your pony and yourself for competitions and special events. From the C Level, you may go on to higher Pony Club ratings such as B, H A, or A Ratings, or specialize in such disciplines as dressage, show jumping, eventing, and showing. Or you may just want to have the pleasure of caring for your horse or pony and participating in your favorite riding activities. Either way, The United States Pony Club Manual of Horsemanship: Intermediate Horsemanship/C Level will give you an excellent basis in horsemanship for the lifelong enjoyment of horses and horse sports.</p><p>About the Author Susan E.

"And yet, in our memory, what character is more alive?" <br>----Widely regarded as the world's first <br>modern novel, Don Quixote chronicles the famous picaresque adventures of the noble knight-errant Don Quixote de La Mancha and his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, as they travel through sixteenth-century Spain. This Modern Library edition presents the acclaimed Samuel Putnam translation of the epic tale, complete with notes, variant readings, and an Introduction by the translator. <br>----The debt owed to Cervantes by literature is immense. From Milan Kundera: "Cervan- <br>tes is the founder of the Modern Era. . . . The novelist need answer to no one but <br>Cervantes." Lionel Trilling observed: "It can be said that all prose fiction is a variation on the theme of Don Quixote." Vladmir Nabo-kov wrote: "Don Quixote is greater today than he was in Cervantes's womb. [He] looms so wonderfully above the skyline of literature, a gaunt giant on a lean nag, that the book lives and will live through [his] sheer vitality. . . . He stands for everything that is gentle, forlorn, pure, unselfish, and gallant. The parody has become a paragon." And V. S. Pritchett observed: "Don Quixote begins as a province, turns into Spain, and ends as a universe. . . . The true spell of Cervantes is that he is a natural magician in pure story-telling." <br> <br> <br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun- <br>dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hardbound editions of important works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inaugurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.Introduction A. J.

Courses in psycholinguistics/psychology of language range from large, lower-level courses to specialized seminar-style courses, taught within Psychology departments, Linguistics departments, and other departments or programs that deal with aspects of language and communication. This new book provides a broad, introductory survey to psycholinguistics that will remain relevant to students whether or not they continue on in the field. <em>Language in Mind</em> addresses important questions and approaches, reflecting a variety of theoretical orientations and viewpoints and provoking a sense of curiosity about language and the structures in the mind and brain that give rise to it. Intriguing stories--presented in an accessible, energetic writing style--set the stage with a question; students then work through a series of theoretical refinements and counterarguments, guided through these unfolding stories with the help of suggested classroom demonstrations and activities. The result is a creative, pleasurable, and deep level of engagement by the student. Throughout, the author communicates the dynamic and evolving nature of the field, synthesizing the key ideas underpinning psycholinguistics research. This approach, in conjunction with the presentation of actual sample stimuli and results, prepares students to be more successful consumers of primary source material.<br> <br> <strong>KEY FEATURES</strong><br> <br> *<strong>Well-crafted prose</strong> presents the material in a plot-driven way that makes students (and instructors) want to read the text.<br> <br> *A range of simple to in-depth <strong>"fieldwork" and in-class Web Activities and Projects</strong> encourages students to work with data, to notice patterns and generalizations, and to generate hypotheses. Brief summaries in the text are supported by materials on the book's Companion Website.<br> <br>*<strong>Special boxes</strong> (1) provide sample stimuli and key data, to assist students in reconstructing the logic of complex experiments and (2) address specific methods implemented by researchers.<br> <br> *<strong>"Language at Large" text modules</strong> relate key concepts to fascinating examples pertinent to the world outside of academia--e.g., advertising, popular culture, the law. These modules are intended to reinforce newly-learned concepts and to stimulate thinking about how abstract ideas can be applied to concrete questions. Additional, updated examples, some drawn from the author's various blogs, will reside on the Companion Website.<br> <br> *End-of-chapter <strong>"Digging Deeper" modules</strong> present topics of outstanding debate in the literature and point to additional readings. Students are encouraged to consider what kind of data or experimental design might help advance the debate. The modular structure of these sections gives instructors the flexibility to assign them or not, without sacrificing students' grasp of material in subsequent chapters.<br> <br> *<strong>Full-color illustrations</strong> support the concepts presented in the text, and create a visually compelling layout.<br> <strong>RESOURCES</strong><br> <br> <em>For the Student</em><br> <strong>Companion Website </strong><br> The Companion Website for <em>Language in Mind</em> includes: all the Web Activities and Projects from the textbook, including supporting materials; additional "Language at Large" modules, updated frequently; Web links; Web essays; and annotated bibliographies.<br> <br> <em>For the Instructor</em><br> <strong>Test Bank</strong><br> A Test Bank is now available for<em> Language in Mind</em>.

She received her Ph.D. in 1997 from the University of Rochester, where she was involved in pioneering research in the use of eye movement methods for studying spoken language comprehension. She held an academic appointment in the Cognitive &amp; Linguistic Sciences at Brown University from 1997 to 2009, where she continued her interdisciplinary research program, and garnered consistently outstanding teaching reviews. She has published more than thirty articles and chapters, and has served as Associate Editor for <em>Linguistics and Philosophy</em>, and as Consulting Editor for the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition</em>. She currently holds an adjunct appointment at the University of Calgary, and divides her time between research/teaching and writing. She is the lead author of the popular science book <em>Sold on Language: How Advertisers Talk to You and What This Says About You</em> (John Wiley and Sons), and blogs regularly for outlets such as <em>Discover Magazine</em> and <em>Language Log</em>.<br><br>"This is a phenomenal textbook. Julie Sedivy writes with incredible clarity about the still relatively murky field of psycholinguistics. All the main areas of psycholinguistics are very accessibly covered." <br>--Judith Degen, <em>Stanford University</em><p></p><br>"It's by far the best textbook on this subject. Sedivy's research background and her skills as a science writer make a great combination." <br>--Adele Goldberg, <em>Princeton University</em><p></p><br>"<em>Language in Mind </em>is an introductory textbook that provides a broad perspective on psycholinguistics in an engaging and accessible way. I highly recommend it to both instructors and students who are looking for a good starting point for psycholinguistics or language science." <br>--Heeju Hwang, <em> The Quarterly Review of Biology</em><p></p><br>"Designed as an undergraduate textbook, <em> Language in Mind: An Introduction to Psycholinguistics </em>is an essential handbook for navigating the sea of text, images, and sound that comprise our communication environment. Sedivy describes herself as having an 'incurable infatuation with language', which is energetically transmitted through <em>Language in Mind</em>, instantiating psycholinguistics as a course that many universities will now want to offer. Overall, the daunting complexities of brain and communication research are approached in a clear and instructive manner. Sedivy encourages readers to critically assess the experimental methods that produced our current knowledge, pushing students to devise their own methods to test hypotheses as well as providing model after model of how to determine the parameters and limitations of an experiment. It would be a joy to teach using this book." <br>--Gwyneth Sutherlin, <em>London School of Economics and Political Science </em>book review<p></p><br></p><h2>Cat Wars: The Devastating Consequences of a Cuddly Killer</h2><p><p><b>Why our cats are a danger to species diversity and human health</b></p><p>In 1894, a lighthouse keeper named David Lyall arrived on Stephens Island off New Zealand with a cat named Tibbles. In just over a year, the Stephens Island Wren, a rare bird endemic to the island, was rendered extinct. Mounting scientific evidence confirms what many conservationists have suspected for some time&#x2015;that in the United States alone, free-ranging cats are killing birds and other animals by the billions. Equally alarming are the little-known but potentially devastating public health consequences of rabies and parasitic <i>Toxoplasma</i> passing from cats to humans at rising rates. <i>Cat Wars</i> tells the story of the threats free-ranging cats pose to biodiversity and public health throughout the world, and sheds new light on the controversies surrounding the management of the explosion of these cat populations.</p><p>This compelling book traces the historical and cultural ties between humans and cats from early domestication to the current boom in pet ownership, along the way accessibly explaining the science of extinction, population modeling, and feline diseases. It charts the developments that have led to our present impasse&#x2015;from Stan Temple's breakthrough studies on cat predation in Wisconsin to cat-eradication programs underway in Australia today. It describes how a small but vocal minority of cat advocates has campaigned successfully for no action in much the same way that special interest groups have stymied attempts to curtail smoking and climate change.</p><p><i>Cat Wars</i> paints a revealing picture of a complex global problem&#x2015;and proposes solutions that foresee a time when wildlife and humans are no longer vulnerable to the impacts of free-ranging cats.</p></p><p><p>"Very few people enjoy thinking about the calamitous problem of free-roaming cats and biodiversity, and even fewer dare to talk about it openly. Marra and Santella's book is therefore doubly welcome. It's not only important reading for anyone who cares about nature. With its engaging storytelling, its calmly scientific approach, and its compassionate handling of a highly fraught issue, this is also a book that a person might actually read for pleasure."<b>--Jonathan Franzen</b></p><p>"Cats, most of them unowned free-ranging cats, kill as many as four billion birds in the United States each year. What, if anything, should be done about it? <i>Cat Wars</i> tackles this difficult dilemma. If you are a cat lover, a bird lover, a philosopher, an ethicist, or just anyone interested in gut-wrenching dilemmas, you will find this a gripping book."<b>--Jared Diamond, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i></b></p><p>"Here, at last, is what native-ecosystem advocates have been waiting for--a complete, dispassionate examination of America's free-ranging cat debacle. It's all here--from the horrendous bird mortality to the cat-borne pathogens blighting wildlife and humans to the cruelty and futility of Trap-Neuter-Return. Everyone gets to speak--including the feral-cat lobby."<b>--Ted Williams, environmental journalist</b></p><p>"The level-tempered approach of <i>Cat Wars</i> will win many advocates. Anyone interested in the broader topics of a healthy environment and healthy human society will benefit from reading this book. It's as powerful as TV ads featuring the &#x2018;crying Indian' in the antilittering campaign of the early 1970s."<b>--Bill Thompson III, editor of <i>Bird Watcher's Digest</i></b></p><p>"In <i>Cat Wars</i>, Peter Marra and Chris Santella lay out the extraordinary (and extraordinarily devastating) toll that America's favorite pet inflicts on America's favorite birds. At a time when native bird populations are in desperate trouble, and the number of free-ranging cats has never been higher, the authors bring clear-eyed science and commonsense solutions to one of the most polarizing issues in avian conservation. This is an important book, even if the message is not a comfortable one."<b>--Scott Weidensaul, author of <i>Living on the Wind: Across the Hemisphere with Migratory Birds</i></b></p><p>"A great overview of a complex and often emotional challenge. <i>Cat Wars</i> unravels yet another layer of the global decline in biodiversity and frames the potentially drastic consequences of inaction."<b>--Grant Sizemore, American Bird Conservancy</b></p><p>"<i>Cat Wars</i> is a brave, engaging, and careful accounting of the cats we love and the devastation they inflict on birds and other wildlife."<b>--John M. Marzluff, author of <i>Welcome to Subirdia: Sharing Our Neighborhoods with Wrens, Robins, Woodpeckers, and Other Wildlife</i></b></p><b>Peter P.

Students will learn to use statistical tools to analyze quantitative data and then apply that knowledge to common questions and problems they will encounter as they continue their studies. </p><p> The fourth edition has been fully updated with new content that reflects the changing face of the kinesiology discipline, including the following: </p><p> � A new chapter on clinical measures, including information on relative risk, odds ratios, and diagnostic testing, that will be especially pertinent to students in athletic training, physical therapy, and other fields dealing with clinical or rehabilitation populations </p><p> � More detailed coverage of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), which is becoming the technique of choice for analyzing pretest&#x2013;posttest control group design </p><p> � New material on statistical inference and correlations, including information on hypothesis testing, types of error, confidence intervals, and partial correlations </p><p> � Additional information on the quantification of reliability and its applications in kinesiology </p><p><i>Statistics in Kinesiology, Fourth Edition</i>, begins with a thorough introduction to basic concepts such as measurement and research; organizing and displaying data; percentiles; mode, median, and mean; and measures of variability. The text then explores more advanced topics, including correlation and regression, t tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and analysis of nonparametric data. While the book offers an overview of the most important statistical concepts and techniques, the emphasis remains on those commonly used concepts in kinesiology disciplines, such as repeated measures ANOVA and the interpretation of interactions in factorial ANOVAs. </p><p> The fourth edition features extensive problem sets that will help students begin to calculate and interpret data. To enhance learning, students are encouraged to practice the calculations manually, but knowledge of advanced mathematics is not required. The examples given involve only basic algebra skills. Information on computer-based application is also provided throughout the book. In becoming familiar with the mathematical formulas used by software programs, students will learn to critically evaluate computer results and interpret data with greater confidence and ease. </p><p> In updating this text, the authors have been careful to retain the features that have made past editions such a success. Examples drawn from exercise physiology, biomechanics, physical education, and physical therapy help students relate to how the techniques are used and how those techniques allow them to answer questions in their chosen fields. The problem sets are designed to help students interact more fully with the content, thereby aiding in their comprehension of concepts and techniques. Answers for each of the problem sets are located in the back of the text and give students the opportunity to check their work as they progress. Chapter summaries and key words lists identify content that students should carefully review. </p><p> With <i>Statistics in Kinesiology, Fourth Edition</i>, students will gain a solid understanding of the statistical techniques used in physical activity fields. The book&#x2019;s practical approach, based on the authors&#x2019; more than 50 years of combined experience in teaching statistics, will make it easy for students to learn these important, but often intimidating, concepts. </p></p><p><p><b>William J.

Featuring a lively narrative that synthesizes the latest scholarship, this volume will engage undergraduate readers on several levels while serving the pedagogical needs of their professors.I look forward to adopting <em>Ways of War</em> as the main textbook in my own United States at War course.&#x2019; <em>&#x2015;</em>Gregory J. W. Urwin, Professor of History, Temple University, USA</p> <p>&#x2018;The data is accurate. The analysis is perceptive. The material is well organized. The text is crisply written.

This is, in short, not merely a model course text, but a valuable general-audience survey of the American military experience.&#x2019; &#x2015; Dennis Showalter, Colorado College, USA</p> <p>&#x2018;The authors wrote <em>Ways of War</em> for two related audiences. Undergraduate students of American Military History gain the base breadth of coverage and depth of detail necessary for them to go on into the specialized monographs and articles. Instructors are assured that the diligent and attentive student will have the context and bibliographic starting points that allows the instructor to examine specific topics, campaigns or battles, and provides enough introduction to support the assignment of substantive papers and research topics.&#x2019; &#x2015; Joseph Fitzharris, University of St Thomas, USA</p> <p>&#x2018;<em>Ways of War: American Military History: From the Colonial Period to the Present</em> offers a detailed yet expansive view of U.S. military history.The authors deftly survey America&#x2019;s military past, exploring definitive wars and campaigns, but also issues of policy, strategy and leadership.This is a useful and informative text, especially for introductory college courses examining the broad sweep of American military history.&#x2019; &#x2015; Lesley J. Gordon, University of Akron, USA</p> <p>'In their new survey for Routledge, military historians Matthew S. Muehlbauer and David J. Ulbrich move beyond a simplified critique of Russell F. Weigley&#x2019;s critical &#x201c;American Way of War&#x201d; thesis to offer a reassessment of how the construct evolved from a number of original influences to take on various forms and applications as circumstances dictated.&nbsp; The end result is a view of American military affairs that is marked by an inherent flexibility that has on occasion been hamstrung by misperceptions on the part of the nation&#x2019;s civilian and military leaders.&nbsp; Based on a wide range of secondary scholarship in American Military History, <em>Ways of War: American Military History from the Colonial Era to the Twenty-First Century</em> (Routledge, 2013) offers far more analytical and narrative detail than many other like-minded surveys, making it a worthy candidate for supplementing and succeeding Weigley&#x2019;s original 1973 work.' <em>&#x2015;</em> Bobby Wintermute, <em>New Books in Military History</em></p> <p>"The authors are well aware of trends in military history to include far more than narrations of battles and campaigns, and each chapter is replete with context, both political and social...these are individually strong chapters, and they are well suited to the classroom. The authors are up-to-date; the old stories and the newer slightly revised versions are all there. It is well illustrated, well organized, and designed to get students to think critically about the use of force and the strategies behind that use." <em>&#x2015;</em>Wayne Lee, University of North Carolina, USA </p> <p>"As a whole, <em>Ways of War</em> (and its website) are rich in detail and will lead serious students to examine&#x2015;or re-examine&#x2015;the primary source material in their areas of particular interest. Matthew Muehlbauer and David Ulbrich deserve high marks for refusing to whitewash recent or long-ago mistakes made by the American military. Their open and honest approach serves them well in their effort to convey the broad scope of US military history and its relevance to American society as a whole. Their ambitious book merits a place on the same shelf as the work of Russell Weigley and in undergraduate or graduate survey courses in American military history." <em>&#x2015;</em>Nathan Albright, <em>Michigan War Studies Review </em></p> <p>�Au-del� d&#x2019;une introduction ne manquant pas de revenir sur un certain nombre de fondamentaux de la th�orie strat�gique, le contexte militaire mondial dans lequel se d�veloppent les forces am�ricaines n&#x2019;est pas oubli� : il est ainsi question des effets de la r�volution militaire, du r�le des femmes dans les forces arm�es, de strat�gie des moyens et de conceptions doctrinales mais aussi de la centralit� des arm�es et du fait militaire dans l&#x2019;histoire am�ricaine.

The sections on the 'ways of war' of the American Indian juxtaposed with the European settlers' practices are exemplary and engage the reader with the newest ideas and concepts. Many textbooks give the early American wars of the European colonists short shrift, but this book gives them a surprising amount of space given its nature as a textbook which must of necessity be highly selective about its subject." &#x2015; Richard W. Stewart, <i>International Bibliography of Military History</i></p> <p>"Already adopted into the U.S. Air Force Academy's core curriculum, <em>Ways of War</em> serves as an excellent primer for officers, noncommissioned officers, and federal civilians seeking understanding of how American warfare has evolved between the colonial period and the 2010s. ...

I reply that it has gone. Then why, he asks, do I look like that? Feel that life is wholly unendurable, and decide madly to get a new hat&#39; It&#39;s not easy being a Provincial Lady in Devonshire in the 1920s, juggling a grumpy husband, mischievous children and a host of domestic dilemmas - from rice mould to a petulant cook. But this Provincial Lady will not be defeated; not by wayward flower bulbs, not by unexpected houseguests, not even by the Blitz. She will continue to preside over the W.I., endure rain-drenched family picnics and succeed as a published author, all the while tending to her strawberries. The Diary of a Provincial Lady is a brilliantly observed comic novel, as funny and fresh today as when it was first written. Widely regarded as one of the funniest English authors and an heir to Jane Austen, E.M. Delafield was born in Sussex in 1890. She took the name Delafield to distinguish herself from her mother (De la Pasture), also a novelist, and wrote over 30 books which could be &#39;as laugh-out-loud funny as PG Wodehouse&#39; before her death in 1943.</p><p>Widely regarded as one of the funniest English authors and an heir to Jane Austen, E.M.

After major retrospectives at the Jewish Contemporary Museum, the Whitney Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Frankenthaler&#39;s work gained significant recognition both within the art world and with the general public. Apart from painting, Frankenthaler also worked in sculpture, ceramics and printmaking, and her oeuvre is the subject of three monographs. Institutions that have recently exhibited her work include the Jeanie Tengelson Gallery at the Art League of New York, Turner Contemporary (England), and Leslie Sacks Fine Art (Los Angeles).</p><h2>Misunderstood: Why the Humble Rat May Be Your Best Pet Ever</h2><p>As much a moving memoir as it is an amusing pet manual, <i>Misunderstood</i> is a unique nonfiction book for teens and tweens about domesticated rats in general and a wonderful rat named Iris in particular. Brimming with smarts and energy just like its furry subjects, Rachel Toor's text blends history and science with profiles of interesting people and autobiographical anecdotes as it joyfully sets the record straight about why this reviled creature is actually a most amazing species. Readers will come away with a deeper understanding and appreciation of domestic rats&#x2015;and may be convinced to adopt one themselves.</p><p><b>Rachel Toor</b> has been an admissions officer at Duke University, a high school cross country coach at the North Carolina School of Science and Math, an SAT prep tutor, and she currently teaches writing at Eastern Washington University in Spokane. A featured columnist for <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, she is the author of four previous books including the YA novel <i>On the Road to Find Out.</i>Gr 6 Up&#x2014;Have you ever considered owning a pet rat? Would you believe that rats make great, low-maintenance pets? Toor aims to reverse negative attitudes toward rats by informing readers of their pleasant nature and many amazing abilities and providing some personal anecdotes about her own rat, Iris. Hesitant readers will immediately be drawn in by the first line of the introduction: "For three and a half years I was in love with someone the size of a hot dog bun." Toor mixes humor with genuine affection as she details how she came to appreciate rats while also debunking some common myths students may be familiar with. For instance, she clarifies that rats alone did not cause the Black Plague; rather, it was the fleas that lived on them (which carried the disease in the form of a bacterial microbe) that were largely responsible. In addition, she briefly covers the concepts of evolution, genetics, and domestication to show how environment and circumstance can influence how a creature develops and acts. The true highlight of this work is the relationship between Toor and Iris during a challenging period in Toor's life (her mother was diagnosed with cancer). Students will feel close to the loving and sweet-tempered Iris. However, tenderhearted readers should be warned that Toor's mother and Iris both die. The author includes material on ratteries (rat breeders), different rat varieties (based on color and coat), and questions to consider before opting for a pet rat.

It depicts an image of God reaching out to touch his creation, Adam. Similarly, the cover of Using MIS 10e depicts a woman wearing augmented reality glasses reaching out to touch the finger of a robot.

Today its 30,000 robots have reduced operating expenses by 20 percent, reduced fulfilment times from 60 minutes down to 15 minutes, and increased inventory capacity by 50 percent.

He ran risks, too, from stray coastguard bullets and sudden double-crosses. But it was the only way he could keep his boat, keep his independence, and keep his belly full. &#34;This active, passionate life on the verge of the tropics is perfect material for the Hemingway style, and the reader carries away from the book a sense of freshness and exhilaration; trade winds, southern cities and warm seas all admirably described by the instrument of precision with which he writes.&#34; - &#34;New Statesman&#34;.</p><p>First things first: readers coming to <i>To Have and Have Not</i> after seeing the Bogart/Bacall film should be forewarned that about the only thing the two have in common is the title. The movie concerns a brave fishing-boat captain in World War II-era Martinique who aids the French Resistance, battles the Nazis, and gets the girl in the end. The novel concerns a broke fishing-boat captain who agrees to carry contraband between Cuba and Florida in order to feed his wife and daughters. Of the two, the novel is by far the darker, more complex work.<p> The first time we meet Harry Morgan, he is sitting in a Havana bar watching a gun battle raging out in the street. After seeing a Cuban get his head blown off with a Luger, Morgan reacts with typical Hemingway understatement: "I took a quick one out of the first bottle I saw open and I couldn't tell you yet what it was. The whole thing made me feel pretty bad." Still feeling bad, Harry heads out in his boat on a charter fishing expedition for which he is later stiffed by the client. With not even enough money to fill his gas tanks, he is forced to agree to smuggle some illegal Chinese for the mysterious Mr. Sing. From there it's just a small step to carrying liquor--a disastrous run that ends when Harry loses an arm and his boat. Once Harry gets mixed up in the brewing Cuban revolution, however, even those losses seem small compared to what's at stake now: his very life.</p><p> Hemingway tells most of this story in the third person, but, significantly, he brackets the whole with a section at the beginning told from Harry's perspective and a short, heart-wrenching chapter at the end narrated by his wife, Marie. In between there is adventure, danger, betrayal, and death, but this novel begins and ends with the tough and tender portrait of a man who plays the cards that are dealt him with courage and dignity, long after hope is gone. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>5 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Homer&#39;s Odyssey: A Commentary bases on the English Translation of Richmond Lattimore</h2><p><p>Peter Jones provides a line-by-line commentary on Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> that explains the factual details, mythological allusions, and Homeric conventions that a student or general reader could not be expected to bring to an initial encounter with the <i>Odyssey</i>.

In this edition Lewis Carroll&#39;s original story of little Alice&#39;s tumble down a rabbit hole is brought to life by stunning illustrations from John Tenniel. The book also features an elegant bonded-leather binding, a satin ribbon bookmark and decorative endpapers.</p><p>That Alice. When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here.

Six years later, annual sales had soared from $5 billion to $16 billion with significant improvement in profitability. The secret? Making fewer, bigger, and bolder bets and stopping a lot of small stuff. Kellogg School professor Mohanbir Sawhney discovered a similar formula for stellar results&#x2014;focus and simplicity&#x2014;in advising Fortune 500 companies.</p><p></p><p>Now Khosla and Sawhney have combined their experiences into a seven-step model for sustained profitable growth in any market, based on fewer but better bets. Drawing on case studies that feature dozens of companies, from Cisco to Hyatt to Spirit Airlines, the authors show how their program applies to global giants, small startups, and any organization in between.</p><p></p><p><i>Fewer, Bigger, Bolder</i> is contrarian and sometimes startlingly counterintuitive. But in an era of chronically tight budgets and dangerously short attention spans, it provides a proven formula for moving ahead with success.</p><p></p></p><p>As president of Kraft Foods&#x2019; developing markets, Sanjay Khosla oversaw revenue growth from $5 billion to $16 billion in six years across over sixty countries. Since 2013, he has been serving as a management consultant, a senior fellow at Northwestern University&#x2019;s Kellogg School of Management, and a senior adviser at BCG.<b>CHAPTER 1<br>THE SEDUCTION OF MORE</b><p>The quest for growth leads companies to expand into new markets, new product categories, new geographies, and new customer segments. Each move seems logical when made, but expansion without focus often leads only to disappointment. Capabilities get stretched beyond the company&#x2019;s comfort zone. Complexity increases faster than revenues. Complications arise with acquired businesses. After meandering for years in pursuit of expansion, companies retreat to refocus on their core. Many business leaders have confessed to us in private: It seemed like a good idea at the time, but I wish we had been more mindful.</p><p>Consider the foray into the consumer market of Cisco Systems, the hugely successful provider of networking equipment. Cisco had survived a bumpy ride after the dot-com bust that began in 2000 and recovered strongly under John Chambers, the widely admired long-term CEO. But by 2007, the company was feeling new pressure to grow revenues, and Chambers and his team began to succumb to the pressures of expansion. The logic seemed impeccable&#x2014;technology was spreading explosively, the consumer market was mushrooming, and opportunities in the &#x201c;consumerization of technology&#x201d; beckoned. In 2010, at the annual weeklong Cisco Live conference for networking and communication professionals, Chambers proudly told a vast audience of guests in Las Vegas that Cisco had introduced four hundred new products in the last year. More than thirty initiatives came in what the company called adjacencies&#x2014;markets and products that seemed close to current Cisco businesses.</p><p>Probably nothing symbolized the company&#x2019;s changing vision more than its pursuit of the Flip, the popular and handy little camcorder. Since its founding in 1984, Cisco had kept its eyes trained on business markets, but in 2009 Cisco paid $590 million to buy Pure Digital, the Flip&#x2019;s maker&#x2014;a leap into consumer products. Why not? The whole world was getting into the consumer market, spurred by Apple&#x2019;s phenomenal success and by the drive to put a device&#x2014;preferably several&#x2014;in the hands of just about everyone. How was Cisco going to keep up if it was nothing more than a &#x201c;plumber&#x201d; of the technology world, as Chambers once put it?</p><p>Just two years later, Cisco shut down its Flip division. Though the camera continued to sell well, the margins were relatively low and the device faced growing competition from smartphones. Chambers said the Flip&#x2019;s demise was part of an effort to bring operations back in line with Cisco&#x2019;s core networking business.</p><p>The Flip was only a tiny piece of the giant Cisco, but the camera&#x2019;s fate was the tip of a very large iceberg. Between the time the company announced Pure Digital&#x2019;s acquisition on March 19, 2009, and the announcement of the Flip&#x2019;s shutdown on April 12, 2011, Cisco&#x2019;s margins slipped and net income was uneven. The company lost share in its core routing and switching markets as it expanded aggressively into dozens of adjacent markets, including high-end videoconferencing, energy-management gear, and consumer products. As Zeus Kerravala of the Yankee Group told Network World in February 2011, &#x201c;Why wouldn&#x2019;t they stick to the stuff they do well and move into 10 markets instead of 30?&#x201d;</p><p>After several quarters of disappointing results and a 30 percent fall in Cisco&#x2019;s stock price from April 2010 to April 2011 (even as the NASDAQ rose 15 percent), Chambers got the message. In April 2011, he announced that Cisco would &#x201c;address with surgical precision what we need to fix in our portfolio.&#x201d; He outlined a streamlined strategy focused on a handful of key areas, including Cisco&#x2019;s core networking business as well as video, collaboration, and data-center technology. He also announced that Cisco would simplify its bloated and overly complex organization, which had ended up confusing its employees and disappointing its investors. After flirting disastrously with mindless expansion, Cisco has rediscovered the power of focus.</p><p>Cisco&#x2019;s experience suggests how seemingly logical growth moves can have unintended consequences. Carlos Dominguez, a senior vice president at Cisco, told Mohan in an interview, &#x201c;People in big companies are not stupid. The senior managers at Cisco are really brilliant people. They&#x2019;ve got the right heart, they&#x2019;ve got the right desire. They&#x2019;re operating in the best interests of customers and shareholders. Each move Cisco made was a logical evolution of where we needed to go into adjacent markets. But every time you respond to issues that come up in the market by developing new products, expanding into adjacent businesses, or making acquisitions, you end up with very complex organizations. It sneaks up on you. Eventually, you have to prioritize. You have to ask: What are the things that made us what we are? What are we good at? What are the essential things we want to do? And you move from all of these opportunities into a very, very finite set of things that you&#x2019;re going to do and you&#x2019;re going to do very well. And I think that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ve done.&#x201d;</p><p>Cisco&#x2019;s experience is hardly isolated. Over the years and through various economic climates, companies have heedlessly turned to expansion&#x2014;too often without a disciplined approach. The notion of quality gets confused with quantity. It can happen with a sprawling multinational, such as Hewlett-Packard, which is struggling to compete in everything from mobile devices to printers to business services, and it can afflict midsize companies, such as Skullcandy, which has introduced several hundred models of headphones. Even nascent technology start-ups can fall into the trap of chasing too many opportunities at the same time and losing focus before they have their first product. Whatever the situation, the mindless pursuit of growth usually results in stumbles from which it can take years to recover.</p><p>These unfocused expansions are very understandable, very human, in a sense. Logic underlies virtually all of them. Companies need to open new markets, launch new products, explore new businesses. Every extension usually brings some additional revenue, at least in the short term, so there&#x2019;s rarely a push back. In isolation, every opportunity looks good. And from the vantage point of a product manager or a business unit leader looking at his or her silo, every new product or market seems promising. But expansion can become addictive, and after a while companies tend to binge like junkies on product variants, brands, acquisitions, and new markets.</p><p>We call this syndrome the Seduction of More. The siren song can take a variety of forms. Sometimes it taps into a basic imperative to get bigger, as leaders are pressured by investors to grow the top line. Other times, the herd mentality takes over&#x2014;everyone else is building a tablet or everyone else is moving into India or China, hence, we should, too. Sometimes ego is the driving force&#x2014;when it comes to acquisitions, for example. Closing a deal and acquiring something becomes a payoff in itself.</p><p>Even the best-run companies aren&#x2019;t immune to the seduction. Consider the story of Illinois Tool Works (ITW), a one-hundred-year-old conglomerate. Founded in 1912, ITW grew to nearly $18 billion in annual revenues by 2012 by acquiring hundreds of small companies over several decades. This acquisition binge resulted in a sprawling confederation of 850 autonomous businesses operating in fifty-eight countries. Each unit brought in an average of less than $30 million in revenues.</p><p>In 2012, the company operated seven primary business segments and an additional &#x201c;miscellaneous&#x201d; segment. A company video proudly noted, &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s wrapped, scrapped, fastened, or welded; built, connected, balanced, or sliced; decorated, packaged, labeled, or protected, chances are Illinois Tool Works is behind it.&#x201d;</p><p>For the transportation industry, ITW makes components, fasteners, fluids, and polymers. For industrial packaging, it manufactures steel, plastic, and paper products used for building, shipping, and protecting goods in transport. The power systems and electronics unit manufactures power conversion and electronics. The food equipment segment builds commercial food equipment. In construction products, ITW builds tools, fasteners, and other construction products. The polymers and fluids unit manufactures adhesives, sealants, lubricants, and other fluids. The decorative services unit manufactures items such as countertops and flooring.</p></p><h2>First with the Most: Nathan Bedford Forrest</h2><p>This is an excellent older biography of Nathan Bedford Forrest.

Using an approach that was both artistically and scientifically ambitious he recorded, in words and pictures, the traces of the traditional Indian way of life that was already beginning to die out. <p>With tireless personal commitment Curtis visited American Indian tribes from the Mexican border to the Bering Straits, gaining their confidence by his patience and sensitivity. This, his photographic life&#x2019;s work, was printed in 20 volumes between 1907 and 1930 as The North American Indian. There were only 272 copies in total, so original copies are now extremely rare. This book gives lasting life to Curtis&#x2019;s great achievements by making the photographs available again.</p></p><p>Originally used to illustrate a 20-volume encyclopedia of Native American history and culture, these photographs from the first decades of the 20th century are a valuable document of history. From a striking 1905 portrait of Geronimo to the seal-hunting Eskimos of Nunivak Island, Edward S. Curtis&#39;s pictures reflect the diversity of cultures that existed among the various Indian tribes. Their quality is superb--Curtis used the then-state-of-the-art photogravure process to reproduce his images--and the 1906 critique from Theodore Roosevelt remains valid: &#34;In Mr. Curtis we have both an artist and a trained observer ... whose work has far more than mere accuracy, because it is truthful.&#34;Hans Christian Adam (born 1948) works as a photographic consultant in G�ttingen. He has published many articles and some books on photography, including TASCHEN&#x2019;s monograph on Karl Blossfeldt.</p><h2>Disquiet, Please!: More Humor Writing from The New Yorker</h2><p><i>The New Yorker</i> is, of course, a bastion of superb essays, influential investigative journalism, and insightful arts criticism. But for eighty years, it&#x2019;s also been a hoot. In fact, when Harold Ross founded the legendary magazine in 1925, he called it &#x201c;a comic weekly,&#x201d; and while it has grown into much more<b>,</b> it has also remained true to its original mission. Now an uproarious sampling of its funny writings can be found in a hilarious new collection, one as satirical and witty, misanthropic and menacing, as the first, <i>Fierce Pajamas</i>.

Steve Martin&#x2019;s pill bottle warns us of side effects ranging from hair that smells of burning tires to teeth receiving radio broadcasts. Andy Borowitz provides his version of theater-lobby notices (&#x201c;In Act III, there is full frontal nudity, but not involving the actor you would like to see naked&#x201d;). David Owen&#x2019;s rules for dating his ex-wife start out magnanimous and swiftly disintegrate into sarcasm, self-loathing, and rage, and Noah Baumbach unfolds a history of his last relationship in the form of Zagat reviews.<br><br>Meanwhile, off in a remote &#x201c;willage&#x201d; in Normandy, David Sedaris is drowning a mouse (&#x201c;This was for the best, whether the mouse realized it or not&#x201d;).<br><br>Plus asides, fancies, rebukes, and musings from Patty Marx, Calvin Trillin, Bruce McCall, Garrison Keillor, Veronica Geng, Ian Frazier, Roy Blount, Jr., and many others. <br><br>If laughter is the best medicine, <i>Disquiet, Please</i> is truly a wonder drug.</p><p>David Remnick is the editor of The New Yorker.<br><br>Henry Finder is the editorial director of The New Yorker.&#x201c;A complete delight from beginning to end.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<b><i>The New York Times</i>, on <i>Fierce Pajamas</i></b></p><h2>Fabric Of Reality</h2><p>An extraordinary and challenging synthesis of ideas uniting Quantum Theory, and the theories of Computation, Knowledge and Evolution, Deutsch&#39;s extraordinary book explores the deep connections between these strands which reveal the fabric of realityin which human actions and ideas play essential roles.</p><p>"Our best theories are not only truer than common sense, they make more sense than common sense," writes physicist David Deutsch. In <i>The Fabric of Reality</i>, Deutsch traces what he considers the four main strands of scientific explanation: quantum theory, evolution, computation, and the theory of knowledge. "The four of them taken together form a coherent explanatory structure that is so far-reaching, and has come to encompass so much of our understanding of the world, that in my view it may already properly be called the first Theory of Everything." Deutsch covers some difficult material with unusual clarity. Each chapter ends with a summary and definitions of important terms, which makes the work an invaluable sourcebook.DAVID DEUTSCH&#39;s research in quantum physics has been influential and highly acclaimed.

(Arthur's little sister) books since then.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also illustrated twelve other books with his wife--author, illustrator, and psychologist Laurie Krasny Brown.<br><br>As a child, Marc Brown's passion for drawing was encouraged by his grandmother Thora, who saved his artwork in the bottom drawer of her bureau.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I knew it must be special," recalls Brown, "because she didn't save many things."&nbsp;&nbsp;His grandmother later provided an education fund that helped Brown pay for art school.&nbsp;&nbsp;He attended the Cleveland Institute of Art from 1964 to 1969.<br><br>Grandma Thora is just one person in Marc Brown's life who has afforded the inspiration for one of his characters.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many other characters are based on children he knew while he was growing up and going to school in Mill Creek, Pennsylvania.&nbsp;&nbsp;His sisters--Bonnie, Colleen, and Kimberly--have all served as models for his characters D.W. and Francine.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown patterned Buster after Terry Johnson, his best friend in elementary school, while Mr. Ratburn is based on "the meanest algebra teacher ever."<br><br>Brown was born in 1946 in Erie, Pennsylvania.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he created the Arthur series, he worked at a variety of jobs, including stints as a truck driver, short-order cook, college professor, soda jerk, actor, chicken farmer, and television art director.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in addition to developing the Arthur television series on PBS, Brown continues to create new books both for Random House Children's Publishing and Little, Brown Books for Young Readers. <br><br>Marc Brown lives in Hingham, Massachusetts, and Martha's Vineyard with Laurie and their young daughter, Eliza.&nbsp;&nbsp;He also has two grown sons, Tolon and Tucker.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown looks to his three children for inspiration and story ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;He also gets many suggestions from children he meets in schools, libraries, and bookstores around the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most interesting--and the funniest--things," Brown says, "happen in real life."Two books take young readers on interactive tours of a typical neighborhood. A companion to Arthur Goes to School, Marc Brown's Arthur's Neighborhood features punch-out play figures that slip into slots in the pages, so they fit comfortably at a table, in a boat, on a rocking horse or into a pair of platform boots at the shoe store.

On the morning of July 22, 1864, Confederate forces under the command of General John Bell Hood squared off against the Army of the Tennessee led by General James B. McPherson just southeast of Atlanta.</p><p>Having replaced General Joseph E. Johnston just four days earlier, Hood had been charged with the duty of reversing a Confederate retreat and meeting the Union army head on. The resulting Battle of Atlanta was a monstrous affair fought in the stifling Georgia summer heat. During it, a dreadful foreboding arose among the Northerners as the battle was undecided and dragged on for eight interminable hours. Hood's men tore into U.S. forces with unrelenting assault after assault. Furthermore, for the first and only time during the war, a U.S. army commander was killed in battle, and in the wake of his death, the Union army staggered. Dramatically, General John "Black Jack" Logan stepped into McPherson's command, rallied the troops, and grimly fought for the rest of the day. In the end, ten thousand men---one out of every six---became casualties on that fateful day, but the Union lines had held.</p><p>Having survived the incessant onslaught from the men in grey, Union forces then placed the city of Atlanta under siege, and the city's inevitable fall would gain much-needed, positive publicity for Lincoln's reelection campaign against the peace platform of former Union general George B. McClellan.<br>Renowned Civil War historian Gary Ecelbarger is in his element here, re-creating the personal and military dramas lived out by generals and foot soldiers alike, and shows how the battle was the game-changing event in the larger Atlanta Campaign and subsequent March to the Sea that brought an eventual end to the bloodiest war in American history. This is gripping military history at its best and a poignant narrative of the day Dixie truly died.</p></p><p><p>GARY ECELBARGER is a Civil War historian and has conducted several tours of the Atlanta Campaign battlefields. He has written or co-written eight books, including <i>The Great Comeback: How Abraham Lincoln Beat the Odds to Win the 1860 Republican Nomination</i>, along with biographies of Civil War generals "Black Jack" Logan and Frederick W. Lander and military histories of the Shenendoah Valley campaign and the First Battle of Kernstown. He lives in northern Virginia with his wife and three children.</p><b>1</b>&nbsp;<br><b>CLOSING THE VISE</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A brass-laden brigade band blared forth a spirited rendition of &#x201c;The Star-Spangled Banner&#x201d; as the blue-clad soldiers of the Army of the Tennessee marched westward toward Atlanta, the objective point of an arduous and angst-filled campaign. The army had begun that trek in Chattanooga seventy-five days and 100 miles earlier. Since then they had crossed three rivers; fought three battles and skirmishes nearly every day between them; all the while enduring hardships from both anticipated and unexpected sources. Six days earlier, 15 men in one division were killed or wounded by a single lightning strike during a violent storm blanketing the Chattahoochie River valley, a freakish bolt that did not discriminate between foot soldiers, artillery men, or mule drivers. Thousands more fell dead or wounded from Confederate lead, iron, and steel over the two months prior to that deadly storm. But on Wednesday morning, July 20, 1864, Atlanta and ultimate victory stood just 6 miles away from the surviving Union soldiers.1<br>The army was not surprised to be so close to its campaign destination. Named for a major river&#x2014;as were most Union armies in the field&#x2014;the Army of the Tennessee, in the haughty words of one of its members, expected &#x201c;nothing but victory&#x201d; at the completion of its campaign. The soldier trumpeted that boast the previous autumn, a prediction borne out by ultimate success in the field. It was a statement that proved true in every major campaign in which the army participated before that: at Fort Donelson, Shiloh, and Corinth in 1862; and at Vicksburg and Chattanooga in 1863. This was the army previously commanded by the two most important generals in the Union: Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. With only a smattering of setbacks on battlefields and two and a half years of continuous victories in military campaigns&#x2014;including the surrender of Confederate armies at Fort Donelson, Tennessee, and Vicksburg, Mississippi&#x2014;the collective opinion of soldiers within the Army of the Tennessee was that the capture of Atlanta was inevitable. They expected nothing less, for they laid claim to be the most successful army on the continent.2<br>In Georgia the Army of the Tennessee was not operating alone. Since the fall of 1863 it moved and fought as a collective unit called the Military Division of the Mississippi. The district was named for a major river as were the three armies under its umbrella&#x2014;the Army of the Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland, and the Army of the Ohio. Major General William T. Sherman led that army group, a command of seven infantry corps, nearly two corps of cavalry, and 250 cannons. It was a formidable Union force approaching 100,000 officers and men.3<br>Sherman had taken over many of the duties left by Ulysses S. Grant, who had departed during March of 1864 to head east as a lieutenant general in charge of all the Union armies in the field. Sherman&#x2019;s promotion carried him from the immediate command of the Army of the Tennessee, a position he had taken once Grant was chosen to head the armies in the Western theater in the fall of 1863, to overall command of the Military Division of the Mississippi. Consequently, throughout the Atlanta campaign of the spring and summer months of 1864, command of the Army of the Tennessee belonged to Sherman&#x2019;s replacement&#x2014;Major General James Birdseye McPherson.<br>McPherson was the darling of all the Union armies in the field&#x2014;at least in the eyes of the two men who mattered the most: Grant and Sherman. He came to Grant&#x2019;s army in the winter of 1861&#x2013;1862 (several months before it was officially called the Army of the Tennessee) and served initially as his chief engineer. By the end of 1862 McPherson had risen from lieutenant colonel to major general and held the helm of Grant&#x2019;s XVII Corps. The corps was active and successful throughout the Vicksburg campaign and even though &#x201c;Mac&#x201d; was overlooked for promotion after Grant was elevated, he was awarded command of the Army of the Tennessee upon Sherman&#x2019;s ascension to Grant&#x2019;s position in March of 1864.<br>The command of an army was the appropriate reward and a seemingly perfect fit for McPherson, the ultimate &#x201c;A&#x201d; student of the Army of the Tennessee. McPherson had graduated first in his West Point class of 1853, a class including the likes of Major General John M. Schofield (in charge of the Army of the Ohio), Major General Philip Sheridan (soon to be in charge of the Union forces in the Shenandoah Valley), and Confederate General John Bell Hood, who stood in his path to Atlanta. Schofield claimed that McPherson was not overly inventive, but &#x201c;his was the most completely balanced mind and character with which I have ever been intimately acquainted....&#x201d; The stress of war had begun to prematurely gray the beard of the thirty-five-year-old Ohioan, but McPherson was otherwise the model of health and fitness. McPherson fit his uniform well. He stood erect, close to the 6' mark, fully bearded with a pleasant face. McPherson was attractive in intellect, personality, and appearance.4<br>He was also taken. McPherson was engaged to Emily Hoffman, a Baltimore belle whom he met at a party in San Francisco during the spring of 1859. Miss Hoffman was twenty-five years old when he met her, young and beautiful, blessed with dainty features and striking blue eyes. It appears that they fell in love at first sight, but the war postponed their wedding, which they had planned for 1861. Just three days after he sailed away from her in August of that year, McPherson poured his heart and soul out to her. &#x201c;You cannot imagine how much I miss you, though each hour is adding to the distance which separates us,&#x201d; he wrote en route to New York from San Francisco. &#x201c;But I thank Heaven every day and hour of my life, dearest Emily, that there are invisible cords stronger and more enduring than any ever made by hands which bind me to you; cords which will withstand the fury of the tempest, the rude shock of battle, and the allurements of an active, exciting life, and cause me to return to you with a heart overflowing with love and devotion.&#x201d;5<br>Active campaigning kept the two lovers apart for nearly three years. McPherson confessed to Sherman his love for her while the generals wrapped up affairs in Vicksburg late in the winter of 1864. In an effort to help out his friend, Sherman arranged for McPherson &#x201c;to steal a furlough&#x201d; late in March of 1864. McPherson arranged to travel to Baltimore to the Hoffman home where he planned to marry Emily. That was a coup in itself because the Hoffman family&#x2014;particularly Emily&#x2019;s mother&#x2014;were passionate Southern sympathizers who swallowed their aversions to allow a Union army commander into their home to wed one of their own. But telegrams sent by Sherman interrupted McPherson&#x2019;s plans while traveling north&#x2014;one announcing his promotion to army command and the other ordering him to northern Alabama to help plan the Georgia campaign. When the frustrated and heartbroken McPherson arrived from the postponed wedding, Sherman empathized. &#x201c;Mac,&#x201d; he told him, &#x201c;it wrings my heart but you can&#x2019;t go now.&#x201d; Sherman followed up by personally writing to Emily Hoffman to smooth over the ruffled feathers and to assure her that McPherson was worth the wait.6<br>The problem for McPherson was that his performance at the initiation of the Atlanta campaign did not exemplify a confident commander. McPherson&#x2019;s letters home reveal his own self-doubts at the time, confessing to his mother, &#x201c;I have a much greater responsibility than I desire.&#x201d;7 His overbearing sense of caution captured him at a moment when the Union needed a risk taker for a swift and victorious end to the campaign. That was exhibited at the opening of the campaign, just west of the town of Resaca on May 9. Instructed to hustle his army through Snake Creek Gap and cut the rail line in the rear while Sherman&#x2019;s other two armies demonstrated in the gaps of Rocky Face Ridge against General Joseph E. Johnston&#x2019;s Army of Tennessee (Confederates named their armies for regions, not rivers), McPherson marched the Army of the Tennessee (at that time consisting of two corps totaling 25,000 men) through the mountain pass and placed the men within striking distance of the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad and the town of Resaca, several miles south of Johnston&#x2019;s Confederates and guarded by only 4,000 troops. McPherson had at least 6,000 men deployed on the hills overlooking that poorly defended locale.<br>If McPherson deployed and charged his men upon Resaca that day, brushing away the overmatched force there and taking control of the railroad and the town, the Southerners would have been trapped in a vise closing upon them from the north and south without a good avenue for escape. The campaign could have&#x2014;and perhaps should have&#x2014;ended with McPherson&#x2019;s offensive, but he vacillated and eventually gave in to his caution, pulling his men back several miles into the gap rather than charging them one mile upon the town. It was a very costly decision, for General Johnston was able to use the railroad and pull his Confederate army unimpeded down to Resaca where they fought three hard days to keep possession of the town from May 13&#x2013;15.

Yet Bataille&#x2019;s thought is complex, and his books make few concessions to the reader. The first series of texts here, however, were written for a wider audience by Bataille and his friends, in the form of a dictionary, and they provide a witty, poetic and concise introduction to his ideas. <p>The Critical Dictionary appeared in the magazine edited by Bataille, Documents, the second series of texts, the Da Costa Encyclop�dique was published anonymously after the liberation of Paris in 1947 by members of the Ac�phale group and writers associated with Surrealists. Both cover the essential concepts of Bataille and his associates: sacred sociology; scatology, death and the erotic; base materialism; the aesthetics of the formless; sacrifice, festival and the politics of the tumult etc: a new description of the limits of being human. Humour, albeit, sardonic, is not absent from these remarkable redefinitions of the most heterogeneous objects or ideas: Camel, Church, Dust, Museum, Spittle, Skyscraper, Threshold, Work &#x2014; to name but a few. </p><p>The Documents group was celebrated for joining together artists, authors, sociologists and ethnologists (among the most important of their time) in a literary and philosophical project. The Ac�phale group was more mysterious, even its membership is only vaguely known, and its activities remain secret. The origins of the Da Costa only became known in 1993, the present volume reveals for the first time its principal compilers: Robert Lebel, Isabelle Waldberg and Marcel Duchamp, even so, the identity of the authors of a large part of it remain unknown.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchFor those who have acquired the taste for surrealist intellectual feasts, this encyclopedia is right on target: it is no less than a cornucopia of thoughts, images, and illustrations reflecting the avant-garde "anti-tradition." Three sets of texts are translated and assembled here: the first two, Critical Dictionary and Related Texts, first appeared in issues of Documents from 1929 and 1930 and primarily were edited by George Bataille; the third, Encyclopaedia Da Costa, appeared anonymously in 1947, though Alastair Brotchie's well-documented historical introduction reveals the identity of its editors (Robert Lebel and Isabelle Waldberg). Contributors to these texts were members of the London and Paris surrealist groups as well as those of the secret society Acephale: artists, writers, sociologists, and ethnologists providing their own interpretation of the meaning of daily life, art, and philosophy. This title is a very useful compendium of surrealist thinking and provides a good introduction to the many-faceted aspects of Surrealism as a movement.<br><i>Danielle Mihram, Univ. of Southern California, University Park</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Science With Plants</h2><p>Scientific activities which encourage children to explore the intriguing nature of plants.

The Prayer is God's gift to all humankind, and in this gorgeously illustrated volume, its simple, archetypal practice unfolds like a fragrant, many-petaled flower, joining words and movements into a single luminous event that engages our entire being.<br><br>These ancient rituals are presented here as a gift for anyone with a heartfelt desire to set aside for a moment the concerns of every day and enter a sacred time and space in which to explore the beckonings of the spirit. The authors take us through the words, movements, and hidden meanings of the Call to Prayer, the Ablutions, The Prayer itself, and the Peaceful Embrace afterwards. Faithful practice lends a sacred rhythm to each day and creates a psychological force that helps us nurture and express a profound inner harmony.<br><br>This first, marvelously accessible interpretation of The Prayer also offers a compelling introductin to the wisdom and teachings of the beloved contemporary Sufi master Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, who brought new life to this mystical tradition by opening a passage to its deepest, universal realities. It is the loving handiwork of two of Bawa's best-known students, Coleman Barks and Michael Green, who also created The Illuminated Rumi.<br><br>Like a jewel given extra brilliance by its setting, The Prayer is surrounded by the wisdom and understanding of the thirteenth-century Sufi master Rumi, whose generous poetry has become an essential canon for modern-day seekers in the West. The final gift is the Primeval Kalima, the core practice and most profound teaching of the Sufi, the "open secret" that leads to Divine Luminous Wisdom.</p><p>Coleman Barks published his first book of poetry, The Juice, in 1972. From the late seventies to the present time, he has been known for his translations of the thirteenth-century mystic Jelaluddin Rumi. He has published versions of other mystical poets as well as his own poetry, and he has collaborated with a variety of artists, dancers, and musicians in the presentation of his material. He is a professor emeritus of English at the University of Georgia.<br><br>Michael Green is a critically acclaimed artist/author, who is working to create a new kind of sacred art for our time. "Some of the most luminous images of our civilization," said the Woodstock Times about The Illuminated Rumi. His other books include Zen &amp; the Art of the Macintosh, Unicornis, The Book of the Dragontooth, and The I-Ching Records. He lives in Pennsylvania's Brandywine Valley.With only a few exceptions, the mystical tradition of Sufism has received little attention outside Muslim countries. Ernst's carefully constructed anthology and Barks and Green's entertaining volume are among the best recent examples of new interest in--and improved publications about--the subject. Ernst (religious studies, Univ. of North Carolina) uses translations from primary sources and his own fine connecting material to shed crucial light on topics such as ethics, music, the mystical understanding of the Qur'an, and saints. (He is especially good on the lives of Sufism's women saints.) This book, which does not dilute or Westernize the originals, should become an essential introduction. Barks and Green's work is more popular in approach and limited in scope, but it is a delightful, skillfully written, and imaginatively illustrated book; it too seems indispensable for a beginner in the mystical traditions of Islam.

In 1776 he drafted the Declaration of Independence, and throughout the Revolution and in the posts he held thereafter - governor of Virginia, minister to France, secretary of state, vice president, and president - Jefferson's responsibilities were enormous and his accomplishments profound. Yet during those years he also was able to design his own house, Monticello, the magnificent Palladian mansion in central Virginia, and later to establish the University of Virginia and to plan its principal buildings.<br>And, through all this, Jefferson made purchases for a lifetime. Needing to furnish not only Monticello but also the ministerial residence in Paris - the Hotel de Langeac - and the President's House in Washington, Jefferson bought with consummate taste and an extraordinary eye for the newest in American, English, and French styles. Fascinated by science and the growing field we now call "technology," Jefferson procured or had built devices for copying letters, telescopes for exploring the stars, and even dumbwaiters to minimize dependence on servants at mealtimes.<br>He was keenly curious about his native land and devoted to promoting its virtues, and he acquired examples of its fossils, flora, and fauna and studied its indigenous peoples. Determined that the former colonies should both enjoy their cultural patrimony and preserve their own history, he purchased original paintings and had copied what could not be bought. He commissioned busts of his intellectual heroes, as well as of the heroes of the American struggle for independence.<br>The Worlds of Thomas Jefferson assembles more than 150 of the objects Jefferson acquired - the first time they have been seen together since the contents of Monticello were dispersed at his death. This astonishing collection reveals the limitless range of his curiosity and the acuteness of his taste, portraying not only Jefferson the statesman but also Jefferson the architect, amateur scientist, connoisseur, farmer, and historian.<br>The articles pictured and described range from priceless historical treasures, such as the lap desk on which the Declaration of Independence was composed, to the personal and homely, such as the wrist strap and dumbbell Jefferson was obliged to use after an injury; from precious objects of art, such as Gilbert Stuart's portraits of Jefferson, to the shards of porcelain found in excavations at Monticello; from the finely worked silver tumblers known as the "Wythe-Jefferson Cups" to the Mandan buffalo robe that was part of his collection of Native American artifacts; from the great Entrance Hall clock he designed for Monticello to the silk damask-upholstered chairs he purchased in Paris.<br>In all, it is a collection that mirrors both the mind of America's greatest statesman and the tastes and styles of the time in history when the American people secured their own independence and offered the world an example of a free people in a democratic state.<br>The Worlds of Thomas Jefferson is written by Susan R. Stein, curator of Monticello, who provides an introduction placing Jefferson's acquisitions within the context of his political career, family life, and intellectual pursuits. In the catalogue each object is described individually with details about its history as well as its importance to Jefferson.</p><p>The neoclassical facade of Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's Virginia mansion, concealed busy interiors crammed with his eclectic collection of paintings, engravings, sculpture, scientific instruments, clocks, maps, Native American artifacts, specimens of natural history, musical instruments, silver, furniture, ceramics and personal objects. This sumptuous catalog with 327 illustrations (107 in color) of an exhibit at Monticello commemorating the 250th anniversary of Jefferson's birth provides a window on his polymathic activities as architect, naturalist, amateur scientist, gardener, historian and connoisseur. Objects shown here range from the desk on which the Declaration of Independence was written to moose antlers and Jefferson's walking stick. In her engaging essay, Stein, curator of Monticello, portrays a passionate collector who displayed both untutored taste and worldly sophistication. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Thomas Jefferson was a man of immense talents and interests. He was not only a distinguished statesman but also a noted scientist, architect, inventor, geographer, and lover of the arts. Monticello's curators have assembled a remarkable exhibition of more than 150 objects owned by Jefferson that reveal the broad range of his interests, from furniture to natural history specimens and writing instruments. The eclectic collection, fully illustrated and detailed in this stunning volume, has been gathered together for the first time since the contents of Monticello were dispersed to mark the 250th anniversary of Jefferson's birth. An insightful essay by Stein places the objects within the context of Jefferson's multifaceted life. Highly recommended for collections on American history and decorative arts.<br><i>- H.

These early thinkers constructed a new intellectual and spiritual world, Wilken shows, and they can still be heard as living voices in the modern world.<br>In chapters on topics including early Christian worship, Christian poetry and the spiritual life, the Trinity, Christ, the Bible, and icons, Wilken shows that the energy and vitality of early Christianity arose from within the life of the Church. While early Christian thinkers drew on the philosophical and rhetorical traditions of the ancient world, it was the versatile vocabulary of the Bible that loosened their tongues and minds and allowed them to construct the world anew, intellectually and spiritually. These thinkers were not seeking to invent a world of ideas, Wilken shows, but rather to win the hearts of men and women and to change their lives.<br>Early Christian thinkers set in place a foundation that has endured. Their writings are an irreplaceable inheritance, and Wilken shows that they can still be heard as living voices within contemporary culture.<br></p><p>Also available by Robert Louis Wilken: The Christians as the Romans Saw Them&#34;By turns scholarly, contemplative, and argumentative, this is an exposition in which the early Christian writers speak for themselvesand to us.&#34; Jaroslav Pelikan, author of The Christian Tradition; &#34;An elegant and learned introduction to the giants of Christian antiquity, this book shows brilliantly how the Church can live by continually pondering the Word of God.&#34;Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J., Fordham University</p><h2>Heritage Studies 3: Student Text</h2><p>Students travel through the growing pains of the new nation from the Constitutional Convention through the Civil War and the westward expansion.

These mothers, wives, and daughters were locked in a web of loyalty and betrayal that would ultimately change the course of English history. In a captivating, multigenerational narrative, Gristwood traces the rise and rule of the seven most critical women in the wars: from Marguerite of Anjou, wife of the Lancastrian Henry VI, who steered the kingdom in her insane husband's stead; to Cecily Neville, matriarch of the rival Yorkist clan, whose son Edward IV murdered his own brother to maintain power; to Margaret Beaufort, who gave up her own claim to the throne in favor of her son, a man who would become the first of a new line of Tudor kings.<br><br>A richly drawn, absorbing epic, <i>Blood Sisters</i> is a tale of hopeful births alongside bloody deaths, of romance as well as brutal pragmatism. It is a story of how women, and the power that women could wield, helped to end the Wars of the Roses, paving the way for the Tudor age and the creation of modern England.<br></p><p>Biographer and journalist Sarah Gristwood attended Oxford University and has been a regular contributor to the <i>London Times, Telegraph, Guardian</i>, and <i>Independent</i>. She is the author of seven previous books, including the best-selling <i>Arbella: England's Lost Queen</i> and <i>Elizabeth and Leicester: Power, Passion, Politics</i>. Gristwood lives in London and Kent.<b><i>Literary Review</i></b><br> Entertaining and vividly drawn . This is the true story of the most important women of the period, their travails and suffering; but also of the links between them, their friendships and ambitions, their cooperation, their courage and pragmatism. It is a different way of looking at this complex period, and Gristwood weaves the story with considerable skill. The battles and bloodshed that led to the loss of so many of the old nobility of England form a backdrop to the narrative, but the real emphasis is on half-a-dozen women whose extraordinary experiences of triumph and disaster, often in a bewilderingly short period of time, brought them to the edge of despair but did not, in the end, lessen their commitment to their families. They provided continuity as the world fell apart around them . Gristwood is to be congratulated for her highly readable account of their lives&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Asbury Park Press</i></b><br> Gristwood crafts a compelling narrative about these fascinating women, not by straying from the truth, but by filling in details and by deducing plausible motives from what little is known.

In this gem of a book, she effortlessly interweaves the dramatic, often tragic, lives of seven royal women . In telling their stories in this original way, and focusing on their diverse roles in the conflict between Lancaster and York, Gristwood reveals how they influenced a male-dominated world. Her text is further enlivened by incisive analysis, exquisite detail and an elegant and witty style . It's the book that I wish I had written.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Toronto Star</b></i><br> [Gristwood's] is a revolutionary approach. For too long, history has been the purview of men, of kings and their battles, wars, conquests, murders and thirst for power.... Gristwood's perspective and lively writing are refreshing.... Certainly there have been individual biographies of each of these seven powerful women but by tracing the connections among them, Gristwood digs into motives and aspirations of royals too long overlooked.... Through them, she gives us an unconventional history of the wars between relations, arguing that their actions mattered as much as battles, and certainly played a significant role in ending the war and establishing the peace.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>The Spectator</b></i><b> (London)</b><br> Sarah Gristwood's sensitive approach marks out <i>Blood Sisters</i> as much more than the narrative of an age . It is an exploration of what it meant to be a medieval queen . In describing what these noble women had in common, Gristwood is able to paint a compelling portrait of this bloody age, complete with the heartbreak and triumphs that went with it .. Medieval queens were far from being mere pawns in the game of thrones.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Sunday Times</i> (London)</b><br> Most of the leading players in the Wars of the Roses have traditionally been thought to be the men. Historian Sarah Gristwood stands this on its head. She examines seven women, whose lives were bound together across the best part of a century, and tries to see the wars from their points of view . Gristwood successfully evokes the lives of all these women, and in doing so brings a new and welcome perspective on the Wars of the Roses.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Maclean's</b></i><br> While most historians focus on the men of the Plantagenet dynasty who tore their families and nation apart during the Wars of the Roses, Gristwood weaves a dizzying array of Yorkists and Lancastrians into an engaging and coherent history by focusing on seven women...who played crucial roles in the bloody feuds known as the cousins' war.'&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br> Gristwood has written a compelling narrative of what went on behind the scenes and away from the battlefields . [<i>Blood Sisters</i>] is an engaging, well written, and thoroughly-researched page turner that should delight academics as much as fans of Philippa Gregory's historical novels about several of the same notable women.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Library Journal</b></i><br> [<i>Blood Sisters</i>] deftly navigates a period of shifting alliances in a clear, concise fashion.

If you tuned in to the CBC show back then, you&#x2019;d have seen five well-dressed venture capitalists shifting around uncomfortably in mismatched chairs in some anonymous warehouse in downtown Toronto.<br>&nbsp;<br>The cast that first season consisted of Jim Treliving, of Boston Pizza fame; Robert Herjavec, who made a fortune in Internet security software; Laurence Lewin, who had an enviable job helming a lingerie empire; and Jennifer Woods, a whip-smart cattle mogul. One after the other, jittery entrepreneurs descended a staircase to present their business proposals, in hopes of scoring much-needed injections of capital to take them to the next level. Much like in the real world, we invested in some, but we dismissed most. I have to admit that on more than one occasion<br>&nbsp;<br>during the shoot, I thought I had made a mistake aligning myself with this strange TV show that had originated, naturally, in Japan. Back then, the pitchers were corralled in a hot tent in the middle of an industrial pit in downtown Toronto. We were fed bad food, worked long hours, and, frankly, were less than impressed with the quality of business ideas being brought to us. I&#x2019;d seen the British version of <i>Dragons&#x2019; Den</i>, which by then was heading into its second successful season, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure that a show about venture capitalism would really take off in Canada. I find the world of venture capitalism to be the most exciting arena known to man. But it&#x2019;s also full of dry jargon, where you bat around terms such as ROI (return on investment), EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), and valuation (what you think your company&#x2019;s worth). Riveting stuff to my ilk. But I worried that producers would have to cut out the business essentials in order to make a show like this palatable to the average viewer, thereby alienating its core audience of business fans.<br>&nbsp;<br>We debuted on October 3, 2006, to lackluster ratings&#x2014;a disappointment, but not a surprise. Every week, however, the ratings seemed to creep up a bit. By the end of season one, we were a cult hit&#x2014;by no means as big as we are now, but people had begun to tune in. I started to become recognized in public, at first in the business arena, and then at the odd restaurant or function, and now I was being gawked at in an airport washroom!<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, I shot the guy a look, as though to say, &#x201c;Do you mind?&#x201d; And there it was, that flicker of recognition.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; this stranger asked, &#x201c;are you Kevin O&#x2019;Leary? From that TV show <i>Dragons&#x2019; Den</i>?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I am.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I love that show!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But <i>you </i>are a total asshole.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, really?&#x201d; I said, a little shocked by such an insult. &#x201c;Why do you say that?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Because you and those other Dragons stole that company from those kids last night. Asking for 50 percent. It&#x2019;s outrageous! You completely stole their company and their souls.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He was talking about a company called JobLoft, created by three savvy MBA students. They had built an easily navigable website that advertised minimum-wage jobs in restaurants and other franchises. I, and a few other Dragons, leapt on it. During the pitch, Jim Treliving alluded to the increasing difficulty in finding restaurant workers for that high-turnover industry, and here was a website that corralled them. (The deal fell apart during the check handover, in a spectacular storm of post&#x2013;due diligence hubris. More on that in chapter 9.)<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Wait a minute,&#x201d; I said to the irate guy in the bathroom. &#x201c;Those kids built a great website, but they&#x2019;ve never run a business. We have every right to want control. That&#x2019;s what you do when you get into business with novices who&#x2019;ve never made a dime.<br>&nbsp;<br>They&#x2019;ll learn a lot from us. And that knowledge, my friend, doesn&#x2019;t come free.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Still,&#x201d; the guy said, throwing his spent paper towel in the garbage can, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re an asshole.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Maybe so,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but assholes get rich because they&#x2019;re not afraid to ask for what they want.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The gentleman left in a huff. He saw a woman standing outside the washroom.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Guess who&#x2019;s in there,&#x201d; he said as he passed her. &#x201c;That asshole Kevin O&#x2019;Leary from <i>Dragons&#x2019; Den</i>.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; the woman said, smiling wearily. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>That woman was Linda, my wife.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since that incident, I have been called much worse names than &#x201c;asshole&#x201d;&#x2014;on and off the screen. And I&#x2019;ll tell you why it has never bothered me: because I speak the truth. Not just because I&#x2019;m a nice guy and want to do the right thing, both of which are mostly true. I tell the truth because I don&#x2019;t like to lead people astray or to waste time. Money&#x2019;s great, money&#x2019;s the point of everything, and I can always earn more. But time is a scarce commodity. It is the true universal currency, because you can&#x2019;t invent, manufacture, or buy time. And not a day goes by when I don&#x2019;t lament that fact. Therefore, I have no time for people, places, or things that waste it.<br>&nbsp;<br>A few months ago, I received a pitch from a smart-sounding sales guy about launching O&#x2019;Leary Funds in India. It was an interesting proposition, but midway through the conversation, obstacles began to surface in my mind. As this man was speaking, I realized that the hurdles we&#x2019;d have to overcome were too high at this juncture in our company&#x2019;s growth cycle. There&#x2019;d be no way to structure the funds so that they&#x2019;d get the kind of yield that O&#x2019;Leary Funds investors were accustomed to. I interrupted the pitch and told the sales guy that, for now, expanding into India was not a viable plan. But thanks anyway. He asked me if we could still book lunch, if only to lay the groundwork for a possible future collaboration. I said no, we wouldn&#x2019;t be meeting for lunch.<br>&nbsp;<br>He implored me. I said no again. There was an uncomfortable pause. Instead of calling me an asshole, which is what I think was on the tip of his tongue, he thanked me and got off the phone. I had clearly hurt his feelings. But my only thought was, &#x201c;Oh well.&#x201d; Unless there&#x2019;s money to be earned, I don&#x2019;t take meetings with people I don&#x2019;t know or need to see. That hour of lunch went into a precious &#x201c;time bank&#x201d; I guard as fiercely as I would a few bars of gold. You might say that this man could have become a valuable contact, someone I could eventually do business with. Maybe. But instead of spending my time on more remote possibilities, I prefer to spend it on current ventures I know will yield results. That&#x2019;s why I said no. It&#x2019;s not personal. I call myself the Merchant of Truth because I speak the truth to everybody all the time. And it can sound blunt to the unaccustomed ear. It might make me come across as an asshole, but that&#x2019;s only because the brutal truth is so rarely spoken these days. It&#x2019;s like an ancient tribal language we&#x2019;ve forgotten we know how to speak. But it&#x2019;s a language I learned at the feet of a woman who was a master with money: my mother, Georgette.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>NEVER LET THEM SEE YOU SWEAT . . . AND NEVER PAY WITH CREDIT</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>I was born in Montreal, Canada, in 1954, smack dab in the middle of the baby-boom generation, about as statistically average as you can get. But nothing about my family was average. On my mother&#x2019;s side, I&#x2019;m descended from a long line of Lebanese merchants, who passed down that vital Phoenician blood. The Phoenicians were merchant mariners&#x2014;traders and sailors&#x2014;who basically put a price tag on one-half of the Mediterranean, selling it to the other half. Silk, tin, wood, or textiles&#x2014;it didn&#x2019;t matter as long as they could make a buck. That Phoenician facility with money, coupled with my biological father&#x2019;s Irish charisma and gift of the gab&#x2014;a laboratory couldn&#x2019;t blend a better vintage of salesman DNA than mine. Business is bred in my bones.<br>&nbsp;<br>In 1904, my maternal grandfather, Joseph Bookalam, came to Canada from a small village in Lebanon. He was sixteen, and he headed straight to the mining town of Cobalt, Ontario, where he had an uncle who owned a general store. He worked like a dog for about three years, running the till, handling the inventory, and serving customers. Finally, he&#x2019;d saved enough money to buy a horse and sleigh, and he struck out on his own. Like his forebears and his progeny, he couldn&#x2019;t stand working for someone else, so he became a roving salesman, trading with indigenous populations that dotted the outlying villages. Like a true Phoenician, he didn&#x2019;t care who his clients were; he had no issues with their religion, ethnicity, or race. If you wanted what he had, he&#x2019;d sell it to you: cooking and hunting utensils, supplies for the fur trade, all of it for cash. The man didn&#x2019;t do credit.</p><h2>Occidental Mythology (Masks of God)</h2><p>A systematic and fascinating comparison of the themes that underlie the art, worship, and literature of the Western world.</p><p>Joseph Campbell was interested in mythology since his childhood in New York, when he read books about American Indians, frequently visited the American Museum of Natural History, and was fascinated by the museum's collection of totem poles. He earned his B.A. and M.A. degrees at Columbia in 1925 and 1927 and went on to study medieval French and Sanskrit at the universities of Paris and Munich. After a period in California, where he encountered John Steinbeck and the biologist Ed Ricketts, he taught at the Canterbury School, then, in 1934, joined the literature department at Sarah Lawrence College, a post he retained for many years. During the 1940s and '50s, he helped Swami Nikhilananda to translate the Upanishads and <b>The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna</b>. The many books by Professor Campbell include <b>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</b>, <b>Myths to Live By</b>, <b>The Flight of the Wild Gander</b>, and <b>The Mythic Image</b>. He edited <b>The Portable Arabian Nights</b>, <b>The Portable Jung</b>, and other works. He died in 1987."I consider this, as his other books, of outstanding importance and scholarship, clarity and depth.

Statistics about headaches and migraines are downright astonishing: One in six people have frequent headaches, and of those, one in ten suffers from migraines. You are not alone. Headaches and migraines result in more than 10 million doctor visits each year. If you struggle frequently with headache pain, this book offers a welcome solution. Trigger point therapy is an effective self-care approach you can use to get relief from headache pain.</p> <p>Trigger points form in a portion of the muscle cell where blood flow is reduced and metabolic wastes are not being exchanged for oxygen and nutrients. When enough trigger points are located together, they can form palpable knots in the tissue. Trigger points can cause pain, either in the area of the trigger point, or by referral to other areas of the body. Trigger points can be treated by applying pressure to affected areas, often providing instant relief. This book explains trigger point physiology and then offers a complete program for self-care that includes detailed illustrations of all pressure and stretching techniques. In addition, it provides an in-depth look at the factors that cause and perpetuate trigger points, such as body mechanics, injuries, diet and nutritional deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, and emotional factors, and provides solutions to address each perpetuating factor.</p></p><p><b>Trigger Point Therapy for Headaches and Migraines</b> offers the first self-treatment approach to use this clinically proven bodywork method to care for headaches and migraines--a great asset to both people in pain and the bodywork practitioners who care for them.Valerie DeLaune, L.Ac., is a licensed acupuncturist and certified neuromuscular therapist, with a master&#39;s degree in acupuncture from the Northwest Institute of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine and a bachelor of science degree from the University of Washington.

Recent figures in the news, such as the&nbsp;&nbsp;self-proclaimed messiah David Koresh of the Branch&nbsp;&nbsp;Davidians, and the prophetic Orthodox Rabbi&nbsp;&nbsp;Menachem Schneerson, are confounding reminders of the&nbsp;&nbsp;forceful vitality of messianism in the modern world.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are also sobering indicators that&nbsp;&nbsp;contemporary society needs to take seriously and understand&nbsp;&nbsp;the messianic mind set. In <i>The Scepter&nbsp;&nbsp;And The Star</i>, biblical scholar John J.&nbsp;&nbsp;Collins unearths the seeds of messianic thought in&nbsp;&nbsp;the Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and other ancient&nbsp;&nbsp;literature.Many of Collins's conclusions hinge on&nbsp;&nbsp;his recent discovery of profoundly important&nbsp;&nbsp;material in the Dead Sea Scrolls. In 1991, nearly fifty&nbsp;&nbsp;years after they were originally folind, the&nbsp;&nbsp;entire collection of the Dead Sea Scrolls was finally&nbsp;&nbsp;released to the public. Collins was one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;first scholars to examine the scrolls and realized&nbsp;&nbsp;that they contained enormously significant messianic&nbsp;&nbsp;texts. <i>The Scepter And The Star</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be the first scholarly work to explore fully&nbsp;&nbsp;the impact this new evidence has on our&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding of Jewish apocalypticism and messianism. In&nbsp;&nbsp;addition, Collins examines the crucial links and&nbsp;&nbsp;similarities between Jewish and Christian models of&nbsp;&nbsp;the messiah. How did Jewish communities, living in&nbsp;&nbsp;the turbulent century before the birth of Christ,&nbsp;&nbsp;envision the end of time? Did Jewish messianic&nbsp;&nbsp;figures influence the development of the Christian&nbsp;&nbsp;Messiah? Here, in careful detail and cogerit,&nbsp;&nbsp;accessible analysis, Collins explains the birth of&nbsp;&nbsp;messianic thought and its repercussions for Jews and&nbsp;&nbsp;Christians alike in ancient--as well as&nbsp;&nbsp;modern-times.</p><p>John J. Collins is Professor of Hebrew Bible at the University of Chicago Divinity School.In this fascinating survey, Collins traces the history and development of the idea of messiah from its earliest appearances in the Hebrew Bible to its culmination in the Judaism and Christianity of the first century c.e. Collins examines biblical and extrabiblical texts to explore the great variety of mantles, from eschatological prophet to Son of Man to Son of God, that messianic figures have worn. In his readings of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Collins discovers, contrary to traditional readings, that the messiah of that community is identified more with a teacher of righteousness than with an apocalyptic prophet who will lead the forces of light in the final battle against the forces of darkness. In addition, the Judaic belief in both a priestly messiah and a kingly (Davidic) messiah in the first century c.e. militates, Collins believes, against any easy identification of Jesus solely as Davidic. Finally, the author argues that careful study of the Scrolls may yet yield the common ground out of which the messianic ideas of Judaism and Christianity developed. Marked by judicious and accessible readings of primary texts, Collins's work is a significant contribution to Doubleday's outstanding biblical reference series. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Carpe Jugulum: Discworld Novel 23</h2><p>Mightily Oats has not picked a good time to be priest. He thought he was there for a simple little religious ceremony. Now he&#x2019;s caught up in a war between vampires and witches, and he&#x2019;s not sure there is a right side. There&#x2019;s the witches &#x2014; Agnes, Magrat, Nanny Ogg, and the formidable Granny Weatherwax... And the vampires: the stakes are high but they&#x2019;re intelligent &#x2014; not easily got rid of with a garlic enema or going to the window and saying &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about you, but isn&#x2019;t it a bit stuffy in here?&#x201d; They&#x2019;ve got style and fancy waistcoats. They&#x2019;re out of the casket and want a bite of the future.</p><p><i>Carpe Jugulum</i> is the 23rd Discworld novel, and with it this durable series continues its juggernaut procession onward. Pratchett is an author who inspires such devotions that his fans will fall on the novel with cries of joy. Nonfans, perhaps, will want to know what all the fuss is about; and that's something difficult to put into a few words. The best thing to do for those completely new to Pratchett is to sample him for themselves, and this novel is as good a place to start as any. But fans have a more precise question. They know that Discworld novels come in one of two varieties: the quite good and the brilliant. So, for instance, where <i>Hogfather</i> and <i>Maskerade</i> were quite good, <i>Feet of Clay</i> and <i>Jingo</i> were brilliant. While true fans wouldn't want to do without the former, they absolutely live for the latter. And with <i>Carpe Jugulum</i>, Pratchett has hit the jackpot again. This novel is one of the brilliant ones. <p> The plot is a version of an earlier Discworld novel, <i>Lords and Ladies</i>, with the predatory elves of that novel being replaced here by suave and deadly vampires, and the tiny kingdom of Lancre being defended by its witches. But plot is the least of Pratchett's appeal, and <i>Carpe Jugulum</i> is loaded with marvelous characters (not least the witches themselves, about whom we learn a deal more), comic touches and scenes of genius, and even some of the renowned down-to-earth Pratchett wisdom (about the inner ethical conflicts we all face and the wrongness of treating people as things). Pratchett's vampires are elegant Bela Lugosi types, and they come up against an unlikely but engaging alliance of witches; blue-skinned pixies like Rob Roy Smurfs; a doubting priest with a boil on his face; and a magical house-size Phoenix in a seamless, completely absorbing, and feel-good-about-the-universe mixture. Highly recommended. <i>--Adam Roberts, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>TERRY PRATCHETT is the acclaimed creator of the global bestselling Discworld series, the first of which, <i>The Colour of Magic,</i> was published in 1983.

While this is not a cookbook for beginners (some of the recipes run three pages in length), those who venture forth to try Heatter&#39;s masterpieces will not be disappointed. The Queen of Desserts, as she has been called for decades, has included handy cooking basics, from the best way to wash blueberries to how to tell if you really have a pint of strawberries (it will actually measure a quart and will weigh a pound). Her recipes are the stuff of heaven: Savannah Banana Pie with Macaroon Crust, Coffee and Cognac Cream Pie, Pear and Almond Tart, and Washington State Cherry Cobbler. Heatter&#39;s recipes, while on the longish side, are simple to follow. You&#39;ll pick up tips for making pies perfect and learn the difference between a buckle, a crisp, a cobbler, a crumble, and a betty. The book goes beyond tarts and pies to include other desserts such as bread puddings, flans, souffl�s, ices, sorbets, and mousses.Maida Heatter, a.k.a.

Somewhere between the second and third volumes of Jan Karon's Mitford Years series, dyed-in-the-wool bachelor Father Timothy Kavanagh and his next-door neighbor Cynthia Coppersmith tied the knot. The author left it to readers' imaginations to fill in the blanks. In this delightful story, Karon paints a complete picture of the events surrounding the wedding of Mitford's best-loved couple, and chronicles the poignant and often hilarious reactions to the nuptial news by the tightly knit North Carolina community.<p> All the details cherished by those who are enchanted by weddings are offered here, from the color of the bridal outfit (aquamarine) to the choice of flowers (virgin's bower and hydrangeas). When the wedding bells finally ring, the pews are packed with the people who make Mitford special: ornery Uncle Billy, delightful Miss Sadie, indispensable Louella, and the cantankerous Emma Newland. And there's not a dry eye in the house when Father Tim's problematic foster child Dooley Barlowe sings for the two people who love him the most.</p><p> <i>A Common Life</i> is not just a wedding story. It's also an intimate portrait of the unfolding love between Cynthia and the shy Father Tim, complete with fears and hesitations, professions of commitment, and Barnabas the dog delivering love letters. But there's nothing heavy-handed here. The tensions don't run any higher than wondering if Cynthia will make it to the wedding on time after getting locked inside her own bathroom, or guessing if Esther will make her famous three-layer orange marmalade cake for the reception. Told in the warm, down-home style that Karon has built her reputation on, <i>A Common Life</i> is sweet without being saccharine, charming without being cloying. It's an invitation to a literary reunion of the best kind, and like all weddings, it will probably coax a few tears and plenty of smiles. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i></p><b>Jan Karon</b>, who lives in Blowing Rock, North Carolina, was an award-winning advertising executive before following her dream of writing books.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the author of five Mitford novels.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>At Home in Mitford</i> and <i>Out of Canaan</i> appeared on the <i>New York Times</i> and other bestseller lists.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>At Home in Mitford</i> was named am ABBY Honor Book by the American Booksellers Association in 1996, 1997, and 1998.</p><h2>Come Rain or Come Shine (Mitford)</h2><p>Graduating from vet school and opening an animal clinic, Dooley Kavanagh, Father Tim Kavanaugh&#39;s adopted son, plans what he hopes will be a simple, affordable wedding with soulmate Lace Harper.

Not good. </p><p>&#x2018;Glad it happened with the heifers, so now we know.&nbsp; With Choo-Choo coming in a few weeks...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t want that big boy getting out,&#x2019; he said.</p><p>&#x2018;If he gets out we&#x2019;re dead in the water. He&#x2019;d head straight for Mink Hershell&#x2019;s cows.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Ah.&#x2019;&nbsp; He didn&#x2019;t know much about those things.</p><p>&#x2018;Mink&#x2019;s cows are small, he&#x2019;s got Dexters&#x2014;around six, seven hundred pounds.&nbsp; Choo-Choo is two years old and clocks in at fourteen hundred pounds.&nbsp; He makes big calves, which can be a serious problem with a small breed. Mink could lose cows if our guy gets in his pasture. Dystocia.&#x2019;</p><p>Life was happening fast.&nbsp; Dooley&#x2019;s graduation from vet school was coming up in a few weeks, then the bull delivery, then the practice turning over from Hal Owen, and on June fourteenth, the wedding... </p><p>&#x2018;So how&#x2019;s Choo-Choo&#x2019;s disposition?&#x2019;&nbsp; </p><p>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s got calves all over the county. He&#x2019;s famous for gettin&#x2019; the job done.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And you bought him because...?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not good timing, for sure, but the owner needed to let him go.&nbsp; It was me or somebody else.&nbsp; I could never top the price. Pliers.&#x2019;</p><p>Tales about Choo-Choo were circulating at the co-op, at least one of them embellished with a direct warning.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x2018;It&#x2019;ll be good to get out with your cattle in the evenings. Relaxing.&#x2019;&nbsp; He was repeating what the neighbors said about having &#x2018;a few head&#x2019; on the place. </p><p>&#x2018;We&#x2019;ll treat small animals at th&#x2019; clinic and I&#x2019;ll have my large animal practice out here on th&#x2019; back forty. I really wanted a mixed practice but there&#x2019;s a great vet just a few miles north. She does it all and does it well.&#x2019; Dooley wiped the sweat from his eyes. &#x2018;Hal loved doing it all but he says he won&#x2019;t miss it; he was on call twenty-four/seven. I&#x2019;d like to give it everything I&#x2019;ve got during the day, and have time in the evenings to spend with Lace&#x2014;with, you know...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Sure.&nbsp; With family. When you have children...&#x2019;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t mean to say that, not at all, it had popped out from overlong suppression.&nbsp; </p><p>The look on Dooley&#x2019;s face...</p><p>He had stepped in it, for sure.&nbsp; Craving grandkids was the vice of those wishing to assure mortality. </p><p>He let the air clear. &#x2018;So. Scared?&#x2019;</p><p>Dooley gave him an ironic look. &#x2018;Were you scared?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I was. Then the peace flowed in.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Need th&#x2019; crimper again,&#x2019; said Dooley.</p><p>It was cool to know what this stuff was.&nbsp; He hauled the thing out of the workbox.&nbsp; </p><p>&#x2018;Thanks, but that&#x2019;s the tamper.&#x2019;</p><p>So this is what people called the simple life.&nbsp; He wiped his face with a bandana and went diving for the crimper.</p><p>Ever since they moved to Meadowgate a month ago, the entire household had gone hammer and tong making the old place ready for the Big Knot. </p><p>They had re-painted the interior of the vet clinic, re-finished the clinic floors and installed new exam tables.&nbsp; He declined to help Cynthia and Lace make curtains for the farmhouse kitchen and drove with Harley to Holding for a pickup load of furniture for the reception room. Somewhere in there, he had conducted a house blessing and a clinic blessing, replete with thurible.&nbsp; Then came repairs on the barn, some minor guttering work on the house, and before Dooley wheeled in yesterday for the weekend, he and Harley and Willie had weed-whacked the fence line and had a serious conversation with the county agent about liming.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s your broom straw,&#x2019; said the agent.&nbsp; </p><p>&#x2018;What about it?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;It tells you your place needs lime. Nature&#x2019;s messenger.&#x2019;</p><p>The agent had given him a wealth of material to read on the subject of lime.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;For today&#x2019;s nut to crack, they were awarded the high-tensile-fence-fix-off.&nbsp; He had prayed for a more challenging retirement and here it was in living color. On the other hand, it was the most fun he&#x2019;d had in a coon&#x2019;s age.&nbsp; Not everybody got to watch a young couple build a whole new life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lace Harper studied the canvas on the easel.</p><p>Being stuck happened a lot these days.&nbsp; Maybe she shouldn&#x2019;t be painting to focus her mind or clear it or whatever she was hoping to do. Maybe she should be painting for passion&#x2019;s sake or not at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>But there was no passion in her&#x2014;she was painting by a kind of rote. Every energy had lately been spent on this vast and overwhelming life they were entering, a life they had dreamed of for years and wanted with all their hearts&#x2014;and&nbsp; now what had taken so long seemed so very sudden. </p><p>Suddenly their own kitchen with its amiable fireplace and big windows.&nbsp; Suddenly the old porches and creaking floors, the immense views, the enormous sky, the hundred acres, the doleful heifers with their bran breath&#x2014;all theirs, and right next door, their own animal clinic.&nbsp; It seemed so grown-up to have a place like this.&nbsp; </p><p>A few years ago, Dooley and the trust people bought more land from Hal and Marge Owen. If cattle were to be in the picture, additional acreage would be needed and Hal made sure the price was right, as he&#x2019;d done when Dooley bought out the practice.&nbsp; Everybody had walked away happy, with the Owens keeping the remaining thirty-five acres.&nbsp; So now Hal and Marge and Rebecca Jane lived in the house they built on the hill to the south, and Hal would work part-time during Dooley&#x2019;s first year in practice.</p><p>They were surrounded on every side by people older, wiser, and definitely more patient.&nbsp; This big, new life seemed truly perfect&#x2014;and also truly scary.&nbsp; The money Dooley inherited from Miss Sadie had stretched through his college and vet school years and bought most of the Meadowgate enterprise, with something left over.&nbsp; But there would be no tapping into the remainder of Miss Sadie&#x2019;s amazing trust, not for a long time. </p><p>All that lay ahead would be totally up to them. They had declined any further help from parents and would be living by their wits and on income from the clinic. It was important that the rest of the journey be theirs.&nbsp; </p><p>Bummer. She had no idea how to proceed with this painting.&nbsp; Maybe it was the subject itself.&nbsp; She was concocting apples from a cell phone photo and blurred imagination instead of working plein air beneath a tree heavy with winesaps.</p><p>But she wasn&#x2019;t trying to paint apples as God made them, she was painting at a slant&#x2014;slathering on color with a palette knife, trying to chase the way the light was moving.&nbsp; All she really wanted was an impression of apples, an impression of a basket, an impression of mountains in the background. Anyway, it wasn&#x2019;t a real painting, it was an exercise.</p><p>&nbsp;She stepped away and squinted at the work. Clearly, she was faking it. She could not afford the time required to fake a painting, exercise or not.</p><p>Somehow, she would make it work. Then maybe she could sell it.&nbsp; They needed money now, not just for the wedding, which would be really, really simple, but also for the upkeep of the property and payroll for Willie and Harley and the clinic employees.&nbsp; Only days ago she had sold an oil to Cynthia&#x2019;s friend, Irene McGraw, who was a fabulous painter.&nbsp; She hoped Irene hadn&#x2019;t bought the small picture because she knew &#x2018;the kids&#x2019; were just starting out.&nbsp; Irene had asked the price but she asked Irene to price it instead.</p><p>&#x2018;I can&#x2019;t do that,&#x2019; Irene said in her quiet way.&nbsp; </p><p>She had blurted out the first thing that came to mind. &#x2018;Four hundred!&#x2019; She didn&#x2019;t want to overestimate her work, not with Irene.&nbsp; At the same time, four hundred seemed overly modest. She felt awkward and gauche.</p><p>Irene smiled. &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve forced me to set the price, after all. It&#x2019;s wonderful piece. Twelve hundred.&#x2019;</p><p>She had the sensation that she might fall backward, and held on to the chair where she was standing.&nbsp; She had sold a lot of work before, but this was especially thrilling because Irene McGraw&#x2019;s paintings were masterful. </p><p>The blood had beat in her again for the work she loved, the gorgeous work with its resinous smells and silken brushes and the restless play of light.</p><p>She should stop now. Time was precious. The Big Knot, as Harley called it, was only weeks away and Dooley&#x2019;s graduation at NC State was practically here, with the bull arriving the day after and the new sign for the vet clinic going up and... </p><p>She turned away from the canvas.</p><p>....and maybe, hopefully, please, God&#x2014;Jack Tyler. </p><p>She felt her heart thump, something like a book dropped to the floor.</p><p>She and Dooley were taking on too much, everyone said that except Father Tim and Cynthia.&nbsp; Father Tim and Cynthia gave them all the liberty they needed, expecting them to do their best. Harley was the biggest objector. &#x2018;Th&#x2019; way y&#x2019;all are goin&#x2019;, you gon&#x2019; be gray-headed.&#x2019; </p><p>&#x2018;Put your teeth in and have a Snickers,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s a <i>pot-luck</i>, Harley. Everybody brings food.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s the least stressful thing in the world, a pot-luck wedding.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Then there&#x2019;s ol&#x2019; Choo-Choo comin&#x2019; in,&#x2019; said Harley. &#x2018;He&#x2019;s got ever&#x2019;body on th&#x2019; place rattled.&#x2019; </p><p>True, but why was their bull everybody&#x2019;s business?&nbsp; People should be concentrating on the wedding, on getting the post in the ground for the new sign to be hung. Every time she went to Farmer, people were telling stories about this really mean bull named Choo- Choo&#x2014;at the post office, the co-op, Jake&#x2019;s.&nbsp; </p><p>The grand wedding and honeymoon that her parents, Hoppy and Olivia, had hoped to give them would have eclipsed everything, bull included. She and Dooley were truly grateful, but they had to say they didn&#x2019;t want that.&nbsp; </p><p>She hated, hated to disappoint Olivia and Hoppy who had been so eager to adopt her, Lace Turner, a total rebellious stray from the Creek who should be eager to please them and wear a gorgeous gown and have a wedding with all the frills at Lord&#x2019;s Chapel.</p><p>Olivia had come from a wealthy family. The silver-framed family portraits in all the rooms at Olivia&#x2019;s house were a testament to her paternal line of coal money. But the day she and Dooley went to tell them the plan, both Hoppy and Olivia had laughed with a kind of childlike delight.&nbsp; Olivia thought a country wedding would be &#x2018;the best thing in the whole world&#x2019; and the idea of a potluck was hilarious, but in a good way. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s not our wedding,&#x2019; Olivia had said, giving them the best of hugs.&nbsp; &#x2018;It&#x2019;s yours.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll be your wedding photographer,&#x2019; said Hoppy, who had a Nikon and loved to use it.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll make the pies,&#x2019; said Olivia, who had learned pie-baking from a former housekeeper and was proud to call it her specialty. </p><p>&#x2018;Cherry!&#x2019; Dooley had said, about to throw up from stress.</p><p>That had gone so much better than expected; she felt really grateful and later wrote them a long letter.&nbsp; </p><p>But she and Dooley still had to tell Father Tim.&nbsp; Everyone knew he hoped to marry them in the Lord&#x2019;s Chapel rose garden that he and Harley and Dooley&#x2019;s brother, Sammy, recovered from ruin. Everyone knew he had trained the Seven Sisters vines to climb in a really special way on the arch, just for this day.</p><p>Lord&#x2019;s Chapel was where she and Dooley were confirmed and baptized, and where Father Tim and Cynthia and Hoppy and Olivia were married. It was the family church.</p><p>She and Dooley had gone one evening to the yellow house.&nbsp; &#x2018;Give me a sign,&#x2019; Dooley said, &#x2018;like when you think it&#x2019;s a good time.&#x2019;</p><p>There is no good time for this, she thought. </p><p>Cynthia had made spaghetti and later, they all sat by the fire in the study.&nbsp; Dooley jiggled his leg a lot and was finally able to say it. &#x2018;We just want to get married at home, Dad. At Meadowgate. With family and a few friends.&#x2019; </p><p>Father Tim had blinked and there was a long pause as if he were trying to absorb what he heard.&nbsp; </p><p>She looked at Dooley, who was miserable.&nbsp; They had tried so hard to do everything right. Like taking seriously the statistics of a high divorce rate in vet school and the rigor of the courses. They&nbsp; had gone through the awful hunger and frustration of being apart, and the endless road trips that connected the dots between Atlanta and Athens and Mitford and Chapel Hill and Farmer, and NC State where Dooley transferred after college.&nbsp; They had gone through four speeding tickets in as many years, two each, not to mention a huge stack of CDs. And now they both wanted to just be at home, please, God&#x2014;at Meadowgate with family. </p><p>Father Tim had smiled then, and nodded.&nbsp; &#x2018;Good,&#x2019; he said like he really, really meant it. &#x2018;Getting married at home is good.&#x2019; </p><p>She had also written them a long letter. </p><p>So no Vera or Oscar or hair bound up in a chignon. She knew all about those beautiful, seductive things; she had spent years looking at dresses and hair styles and being a bridesmaid at glamorous weddings. Then for some reason she never expected, none of that mattered anymore. She had done it in her head over and over&#x2014;the shoes, the jewelry, the music; she had walked down the aisle a thousand times and saw heads turning and heard the little gasps of approval.&nbsp; She felt a new kind of joy in knowing that she and Dooley would have something more wonderful than the grand wedding, the awesome honeymoon, the lingerie as ephemeral as mist.</p><p>&#x2018;We could even have a barefoot wedding,&#x2019; she said to Dooley.&nbsp; </p><p>&#x2018;Wait&#x2019;ll y&#x2019;uns step on a bee,&#x2019; said Harley. &#x2018;Or one of them black snakes.&nbsp; That&#x2019;ll cure y&#x2019; of barefooted, I can tell y&#x2019; that.&#x2019;</p><p>She and Dooley had dug deep to wait through the last years of college and vet school.&nbsp; How would she direct herself while he focused on academics? Her art instructors had been crazy about her portfolio; they said she could go anywhere and do anything and so she pursued jobs in publishing, in advertising, and then in design, but wherever she applied, it was &#x2018;the economy.&#x2019;&nbsp; Here, there, everywhere, &#x2018;the economy.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;While Dooley was on a totally defined path, she was constantly trying to figure things out in a wandering sort of way.&nbsp; She resisted, without really understanding why, Olivia&#x2019;s generous offer to underwrite a graduate program in Art and Design at Pratt, which anybody in their right mind would go for if they could get accepted.&nbsp; She adored Hoppy and Olivia, who had given her everything including their name and their amazing love, but the answer was no and so there she went again, wandering like an Israelite. </p><p>What saved her in these final couple of years was teaching art to children at a non-profit in Chapel Hill, where she moved to be near Dooley.&nbsp; She had learned more from them than she could ever teach. It had been, in some ways, the time of her life, and she had loved each of them fiercely.</p><p>Perhaps she would teach again one day. But what she wanted now was to work with Dooley in the clinic.&nbsp; Though it was an estab...</p></p><h2>The Arabian Nights: The Marvels and Wonders of the Thousand and One Nights</h2><p>A modern edition of the classic tales includes stories filled with humorous and valuable lessons</p><p>Full of mischief, valor, ribaldry, and romance, The Arabian Nights has enthralled readers for centuries.

In retrospect, Beckett dismissed it as written in "cheap flashy philosophical jargon."The essay served double duty as its author's aesthetic and epistemological manifesto, proclaiming on behalf of its ostensible subject: "We cannot know and we cannot be known." In dense and allusive language, Beckett credited his current influences (notably Schopenhauer and Calder�n) and forecast his future preoccupations, reading them into the prose of Marcel Proust: The laws of memory are subject to the more general laws of habit. Habit is a compromise effected between the individual and his environment, or between the individual and his own organic eccentricities, the guarantee of a dull inviolability, the lightning-conductor of his existence. Habit is the ballast that chains the dog to his vomit. Breathing is habit. Life is habit. Or rather life is a succession of habits, since the individual is a succession of individuals; the world being a projection of the individual's consciousness. Beckett went on to pinpoint his moral focus on the fundamental quandaries of human existence, disclaiming any involvement in social issues: Here, as always, Proust is completely detached from all moral considerations. There is no right and wrong in Proust nor in his world. (Except possibly in those passages dealing with the war, when for a space he ceases to be an artist and raises his voice with the plebs, mob, rabble, canaille.) Tragedy is not concerned with human justice. Tragedy is the statement of an expiation, but not the miserable expiation of a codified breach of a local arrangement, organised by the knaves for the fools. The tragic figure represents the expiation of original sin, of the original and eternal sin of him and all his 'soci malorum,' the sin of having been born.</p><p></p><h2>Going on Being: Buddhism and the Way of Change</h2><p>The bestselling author of <b>Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart </b>combines a memoir of his own journey as a student of Buddhism and psychology with a powerful message about how cultivating true self-awareness and adopting a Buddhist understanding of change can free the mind.<br><br>"Meditation was the vehicle that opened me up to myself, but psychotherapy, in the right hands, has similar potential. It was actually through my own therapy and my own studies of Western psychoanalytic thought that I began to understand what meditation made possible. As compelling as the language of Buddhism was for me, I needed to figure things out in Western concepts as well. Psychotherapy came after meditation in my life, but it reinforced what meditation had shown me."<br><br>Before Mark Epstein became a medical student at Harvard and began training as a psychiatrist, he immersed himself in Buddhism through experiences with such influential Buddhist teachers as Ram Dass, Joseph Goldstein, and Jack Kornfield. The positive outlook of Buddhism and the meditative principle of living in the moment came to influence his study and practice of psychotherapy profoundly. <b>Going on Being</b><i> </i>is Epstein&#x2019;s memoir of his early years as a student of Buddhism and of how Buddhism shaped his approach to therapy. It is also a practical guide to how a Buddhist understanding of psychological problems makes change for the better possible.<br><br>In psychotherapy, Epstein discovered a vital interpersonal parallel to meditation, but he also recognized Western psychology&#x2019;s tendency to focus on problems, either by attempting to eliminate them or by going into them more deeply, and how this too often results in a frustrating &#x201c;paralysis of analysis.&#x201d; Buddhism opened his eyes to another way of change. Drawing on his own life and stories of his patients, he illuminates the concept of &#x201c;going on being,&#x201d; the capacity we all have to live in a fully aware and creative state unimpeded by constraints or expectations.<br><br>By chronicling how Buddhism and psychotherapy shaped his own growth, Mark Epstein has written an intimate chronicle of the evolution of spirit and psyche, and a highly inviting guide for anyone seeking a new path and a new outlook on life.</p><p>Can you remember the childhood feeling of living happily moment to moment, without intrusive aims or fears? Psychoanalyst D.W. Winnicott called it the state of "going on being." Bestselling author Mark Epstein sees a similarity with the Buddhist practice of mindfulness, of just watching the mind and body without holding on or pushing away. Epstein excels at finding the similarities between Buddhist meditation and psychotherapy, and he is in top form in <i>Going On Being</i>. Offering an autobiographical account of his own gradual discovery of this nexus, Epstein tells of his encounters with such luminaries as Ram Dass, Joseph Goldstein, and Jack Kornfield, ruminating on them and then showing how his insights shed light on his work as a psychoanalyst. Ultimately, he finds that psychoanalysis can function as a kind of interpersonal meditation, helping the patient see aspects of the self that are hidden behind habitual ways of reacting to the world. <i>Going On Being</i> shows that, if done well, psychotherapy can offer some of the same benefits as Buddhist meditation. Eureka! <i>--Brian Bruya</i>"A thoughtful and compassionate view of what therapy can accomplish when it recognizes the indivisibility of the psyche and spirit."<br>&#x2013;<i>New Age</i><br><br>"Lucid and thoughtful."&#x2013;<i>Elle<br><br></i>"Like the best Buddhist masters, Epstein tells wonderful stories, full of wisdom and flashes of inspiration. From the stories emerges a way of being and seeing." &#x2013;<i>Booklist </i></p><h2>Morgawr (The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara, Book 3)</h2><p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Terry Brooks became the master of epic fantasy with the publication of his legendary debut, <i>The Sword of Shannara</i>. Since then, each new novel in the Shannara saga has brilliantly built upon and deepened the world of breathtaking magic, adventure, and intrigue he created. In <i>The Voyage of the</i> Jerle Shannara&#x2014;his third enchanting series&#x2014;he literally took his legions of loyal readers soaring to new heights as a colorful contingent of characters took to the skies aboard a magnificent airship on a quest fraught with wonder and danger. <br><br>Now in <i>Morgawr</i>, the quest at last draws to its climactic conclusion, as the forces of good and evil vying against each other to possess an ancient magic race towards an explosive clash&#x2014;and whatever fate awaits the victor . . . and the vanquished. Harrowing confrontations with the merciless Ilse Witch and the monstrous Antrax have already taken their toll on the intrepid heroes of the Four Lands. But their darkest adversary now snaps at their heels, in the form of the Morgawr&#x2014;master of the Ilse Witch, feeder upon the souls of his enemies, and centuries-old sorcerer of unimaginable might. <br><br>With a fleet of airships and a crew of walking dead men at his command, the Morgawr is in relentless pursuit of the <i>Jerle Shannara</i> and the crew that mans her. For the Morgawr, the goal is two fold: to find and control the fabled ancient books of magic, and to destroy the dark disciple who betrayed him&#x2014;the Ilse Witch. But the Ilse Witch is already a prisoner . . . of herself. Exposed to the awesome power of the Sword of Shannara, and forced to confront the truth of her horrifying deeds, she has fled deep into her own mind. Now at the mercy of those who seek vengeance against her, her only protector is her long-lost brother, Bek Ohmsford, who is determined to redeem his beloved sister . . . and deliver her to the destiny predicted for her by the Druid Walker Boh. <br><br>Once again, Terry Brooks weaves together high adventure, vividly wrought characters, and a spellbinding world into an irresistible story of heroism and sacrifice, love and honor. In <i>Morgawr</i>, fans of the Shannara mythos will find both a satisfying finale and the promise of new wonders yet to come.</p><p>A writer since high school, <b>Terry Brooks </b>published his first novel, <i>The Sword of Shannara</i>, in 1977. It was a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller for more than five months. He has published twenty consecutive bestsellers since, including <i>The Voyage of the </i>Jerle Shannara novels<i>: Ilse Witch</i> and <i>Antrax</i>, as well as the novel based upon the screenplay and story by George Lucas: <i>Star Wars</i>�: Episode I <i>The Phantom Menace</i>&#x2122;.

The hallway leading to his sleeping chamber was dark with nightfall's shadows, and the light from the wall lamps cast only scattered halos of fuzzy brightness. The lamps gave no help in this instance, and the Minister of Defense was given no chance either to flee or defend himself.<br><br>"A word, if you please, Minister."<br><br>The intruder was cloaked and hooded, and although Sen Dunsidan was reminded at once of the Ilse Witch he knew without question that it was not she. This was a man, not a woman--too much size and bulk to be anything else, and the words were rough and masculine. The witch's small, slender form and cool, smooth voice were missing. She had come to him only a week earlier, before departing on her voyage aboard <i>Black Moclips</i>, tracking the Druid Walker and his company to an unknown destination. Now this intruder, cloaked and hooded in the same manner, had appeared in the same way--at night and unannounced. He wondered at once what the connection was between the two.<br><br>Masking his surprise and the hint of fear that clutched at his chest, Sen Dunsidan nodded. "Where would you like to share this word?"<br><br>"Your sleeping chamber will do."<br><br>A big man himself, still in the prime of his life, the Minister of Defense nevertheless felt dwarfed by the other. It was more than simply size; it was presence, as well. The intruder exuded strength and confidence not usually encountered in ordinary men. Sen Dunsidan did not ask how he had managed to gain entry to the closely guarded, walled compound. He did not ask how he had moved unchallenged to the upper floor of his quarters. Such questions were pointless. He simply accepted that the intruder was capable of this and much more. He did as he was bidden. He walked past with a deferential bow, opened his bedroom door, and beckoned the other inside.<br><br>The lights were lit here, as well, though no more brightly than in the hallway without, and the intruder moved at once into the shadows.<br><br>"Sit down, Minister, and I will tell you what I want."<br><br>Sen Dunsidan sat in a high-backed chair and crossed his legs comfortably. His fear and surprise had faded. If the other meant him harm, he would not have bothered to announce himself. He wanted something that a Minister of Defense of the Federation's Coalition Council could offer, so there was no particular cause for concern. Not yet, anyway. That could change if he could not supply the answers the other sought. But Sen Dunsidan was a master at telling others what they expected to hear.<br><br>"Some cold ale?" he asked.<br><br>"Pour some for yourself, Minister."<br><br>Sen Dunsidan hesitated, surprised by insistence in the other's voice. Then he rose and walked to the table at his bedside that held the ice bucket, ale pitcher nestled within it, and several glasses. He stood looking down at the ale as he poured, his long silver hair hanging loose about his shoulders save where it was braided above the ears, as was the current fashion. He did not like what he was feeling now, uncertainty come so swiftly on the heels of newfound confidence. He had better be careful of this man; step lightly.<br><br>He walked back to his chair and reseated himself, sipping at the ale. His strong face turned toward the other, a barely visible presence amid the shadows.<br><br>"I have something to ask of you," the intruder said softly.<br><br>Sen Dunsidan nodded and made an expansive gesture with one hand.<br><br>The intruder shifted slightly. "Be warned, Minister. Do not think to placate me with promises you do not intend to keep. I am not here to waste my time on fools who think to dismiss me with empty words. If I sense you dissemble, I will simply kill you and have done with it. Do you understand?"<br><br>Sen Dunsidan took a deep breath to steady himself. "I understand."<br><br>The other said nothing further for a moment, then moved out from the deep shadows to the edges of the light. "I am called the Morgawr. I am mentor to the Ilse Witch."<br><br>"Ah." The Minister of Defense nodded. He had not been wrong about the similarities of appearance.<br><br>The cloaked form moved a little closer. "You and I are about to form a partnership, Minister. A new partnership, one to replace that which you shared with my pupil. She no longer has need of you. She will not come to see you again. But I will. Often."<br><br>"Does she know this?" Dunsidan asked softly.<br><br>"She knows nowhere near as much as she thinks." The other's voice was hard and low. "She has decided to betray me, and for her infidelity she will be punished. I will administer her punishment when I see her next. This does not concern you, save that you should know why you will not see her again. All these years, I have been the force behind her efforts. I have been the one who gave her the power to form alliances like the one she shared with you. But she breaches my trust and thus forfeits my protection. She is of no further use."<br><br>Sen Dunsidan took a long pull on his ale and set the glass aside. "You will forgive me, sir, if I voice a note of skepticism. I don't know you, but I do know her. I know what she can do. I know what happens to those who betray her, and I do not intend to become one of them."<br><br>"Perhaps you would do better to be afraid of me. I am the one who stands here in front of you."<br><br>"Perhaps. But the Dark Lady has a way of showing up when least expected. Show me her head, and I will be more than happy to discuss a new agreement."<br><br>The cloaked figure laughed softly. "Well spoken, Minister. You offer a politician's answer to a tough demand. But I think you must reconsider. Look at me."<br><br>He reached up for his hood and pulled it away to reveal his face. It was the face of the Ilse Witch, youthful and smooth and filled with danger. Sen Dunsidan started in spite of himself. Then the girl's face changed, almost as if it were a mirage, and became Sen Dunsidan's--hard planes and edges, piercing blue eyes, silvery hair worn long, and a half smile that seemed ready to promise anything.<br><br>"You and I are very much alike, Minister."<br><br>The face changed again. Another took its place, the face of a younger man, but it was no one Sen Dunsidan had ever seen. It was nondescript, bland to the point of being forgettable, devoid of interesting or memorable features.<br><br>"Is this who I really am, Minister? Do I reveal myself now?" He paused. "Or am I really like this?"<br><br>The face shimmered and changed into something monstrous, a reptilian visage with a blunt snout and slits for eyes. Rough, gray scales coated a weathered face, and a wide, serrated mouth opened to reveal rows of sharply pointed teeth. Gimlet eyes, hate-filled and poisonous, glimmered with green fire.<br><br>The intruder pulled the hood back into place, and his face disappeared into the resulting shadows. Sen Dunsidan sat motionless in his chair. He was all too aware of what he was being told. This man had the use of a very powerful magic. At the very least, he could shape-shift, and it was likely he could do much more than that. He was a man who enjoyed the excesses of power as much as the Minister of Defense did, and he would use that power in whatever way he felt he must to get what he wanted.<br><br>"I said we were alike, Minister," the intruder whispered. "We both appear as one thing when in truth we are another. I know you. I know you as I know myself. You would do anything to further your power in the hierarchy of the Federation. You indulge yourself in pleasures that are forbidden to other men. You covet what you cannot have and scheme to secure it. You smile and feign friendship when in truth you are the very serpent your enemies fear."<br><br>Sen Dunsidan kept his politician's smile in place. What was it this creature wanted of him?<br><br>"I tell you all this not to anger you, Minister, but to make certain you do not mistake my intent. I am here to help you further your ambitions in exchange for help you can in turn supply to me. I desire to pursue the witch on her voyage. I desire to be there when she does battle with the Druid, as I am certain she must. I desire to catch her with the magic she pursues, because I intend to take it from her and then to take her life. But to accomplish this, I will need a fleet of airships and the men to crew them."<br><br>Sen Dunsidan stared at him in disbelief. "What you ask is impossible."<br><br>"Nothing is impossible, Minister." The black robes shifted with a soft rustle as the intruder crossed the room. "Is what I ask any more impossible than what you seek?"<br><br>The Minister of Defense hesitated. "Which is what?"<br><br>"To be Prime Minister. To take control of the Coalition Council once and for all. To rule the Federation, and by doing so, the Four Lands."<br><br>A number of thoughts passed swiftly through Sen Dunsidan's mind, but all of them came down to one. The intruder was right. Sen Dunsidan would do anything to make himself Prime Minister and control the Coalition Council. Even the Ilse Witch had known of this ambition, though she had never voiced it in such a way as this, a way that suggested it might be within reach.<br><br>"Both seem impossible to me," he answered the other carefully.<br><br>"You fail to see what I am telling you," the intruder said. "I am telling you why I will prove a better ally than the little witch. Who stands between you and your goal? The Prime Minister, who is hardy and well? He will serve long years before he steps down. His chosen successor, the Minister of the Treasury, Jaren Arken? He is a man younger than you and equally powerful, equally ruthless. He aspires to be Minister of Defense, doesn't he? He seeks your position ...</p><h2>Religion And The Decline Of Magic</h2><p>Witchcraft, astrology, divination and every kind of popular magic flourished in England during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, from the belief that a blessed amulet could prevent the assaults of the Devil to the use of the same charms to recover stolen goods. At the same time, the Protestant Reformation attempted to take the magic out of religion, and scientists were developing new explanations of the universe.

The dry soil didn&#x2019;t seem to have dimmed the color of the petals. <i>Not particularly showy flowers, but they&#x2019;re tough,</i> Ayane thought, gazing out onto the veranda through the sliding glass door. <i>I&#x2019;ll have to water them when I get a chance.</i><br>&#x201c;Have you heard a single word I&#x2019;ve said?&#x201d; Yoshitaka asked.<br>She turned around and smiled faintly. &#x201c;Yes, everything. How could I not?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You might try answering more quickly, then.&#x201d; Yoshitaka, lounging on the sofa, uncrossed and recrossed his long legs. In his frequent workouts, he took pains not to put on too much lower-body muscle&#x2014;nothing that would prevent him from wearing the slim-cut dress pants he preferred.<br>&#x201c;I suppose my mind must&#x2019;ve wandered.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh? That&#x2019;s not like you.&#x201d; Her husband raised a single sculpted eyebrow.<br>&#x201c;What you said was surprising, you know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I find that hard to believe. You should be familiar with my life plan by now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Familiar&nbsp;... Maybe so.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What are you trying to say?&#x201d; Yoshitaka leaned back and stretched his arms out along the sofa top, ostentatious in his lack of concern. Ayane wondered if he was acting or if he truly was that nonchalant.<br>She took a breath and stared at his handsome features.<br>&#x201c;Is it such a big deal to you?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&#x201c;Is what a big deal?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Having children.&#x201d;<br>Yoshitaka gave a derisive, wry little smile; he glanced away, then looked back at her. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t been listening to me at all, have you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I <i>have</i> been listening,&#x201d; she said with a glare she hoped he&#x2019;d notice. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m asking.&#x201d;<br>The smile faded from his lips. He nodded slowly. &#x201c;It <i>is</i> a big deal. A very big deal. Essential, even. If we can&#x2019;t have children, there&#x2019;s no point to us being married. Romantic love between a man and a woman always fades with time. People live together in order to build a family. A man and woman get married and become husband and wife. Then they have children and become father and mother. Only then do they become life partners in the true sense of the word. You don&#x2019;t agree?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s all marriage is.&#x201d;<br>Yoshitaka shook his head. &#x201c;I do. I believe it quite strongly and have no intention of changing my mind. Which is to say, I&#x2019;ve no intention of continuing on like this if we can&#x2019;t have children.&#x201d;<br>Ayane pressed her fingers to her temples. She had a headache. She hadn&#x2019;t seen this one coming. &#x201c;Let me get this straight,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need a woman who can&#x2019;t bear your children. So you&#x2019;ll throw me out and switch to someone who can? That&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re telling me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No need to put it so harshly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re saying!&#x201d;<br>Yoshitaka straightened. He hesitated, frowning slightly, before nodding again. &#x201c;I suppose that from your perspective it would look that way, yes. You have to understand, I take my life plan very seriously. More seriously than anything else.&#x201d;<br>Ayane&#x2019;s lips curled upward, though smiling was the furthest thing from her mind. &#x201c;You like telling people that, don&#x2019;t you? How you take your life plan so seriously. It was one of the first things you said when we met.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What are you so upset about, Ayane? You have everything you ever wanted.

It had taken her three months to make it; she remembered the material, special ordered direct from a manufacturer in England.<br>She didn&#x2019;t need Yoshitaka to tell her how important children were. She had wanted them herself, desperately. How many times had she dreamed of sitting in a rocking chair, stitching a patchwork quilt, watching her belly grow larger with each passing day? But God, in his mischief, had made that impossible. So she had given up&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t like she&#x2019;d had a choice&#x2014;and resigned herself to living without. She had thought her husband would be okay with that.<br>&#x201c;I know it might seem silly to you, but can I ask one question?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br>Ayane faced him again, taking a deep breath. &#x201c;What about your love for me? Whatever happened to that?&#x201d;<br>Yoshitaka flinched, then gradually his smile returned. &#x201c;My love for you hasn&#x2019;t changed a bit,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I can assure you of that. I <i>do</i> still love you.&#x201d;<br>That was a complete lie, as far as Ayane was concerned. But she smiled and said that was good. She wasn&#x2019;t sure how else to respond.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d; Yoshitaka stood and headed for the door.<br>Ayane glanced at her dresser, thinking about the white powder hidden in a sealed plastic bag in the bottommost drawer on the right.<br><i>Guess I&#x2019;ll be using that soon,</i> she thought, the last glimmer of hope fading beneath the shadow inside her.<br>As she followed him out the door, she stared at Yoshitaka&#x2019;s back, thinking, <i>I love you more than anything else in this world. That&#x2019;s why your words were like a knife stabbing me in the heart.</i><br><i>That&#x2019;s why you have to die, too.</i><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2008 by Keigo Higashino<br></p><h2>The Last Promise</h2><p>Having followed her new husband to his native home in rustic Tuscany, Eliana distracts herself from her marital disappointments by caring for her asthmatic son and finds herself reevaluating her life when she meets a fellow art lover, American Ross Story. 450,000 first printing.</p><p>Richard Paul Evans is a number one <i>New York Times</i>bestselling author. <i>The Last Promise</i> is his seventh novel.The beautiful and romantic story of Eliana focuses on an American trapped in a marriage to a philandering Italian who forces her to stay in Italy, or lose her son.

Lincoln was asked to memorialize the gruesome battle. Instead, he gave the whole nation &#34;a new birth of freedom&#34; in the space of a mere 272 words. His entire life and previous training, and his deep political experience went into this, his revolutionary masterpiece. By examining both the address and Lincoln in their historical moment and cultural frame, Wills breathes new life into words we thought we knew, and reveals much about a president so mythologized but often misunderstood. Wills shows how Lincoln came to change the world and to effect an intellectual revolution, how his words had to and did complete the work of the guns, and how Lincoln wove a spell that has not yet been broken.</p><p>A former professor of Greek at Yale University, Wills painstakingly deconstructs Lincoln&#39;s Gettysburg Address and discovers heavy influence from the early Greeks (Pericles) and the 19th century Transcendentalists (Edward Everett). The author also probes Lincoln&#39;s decision to rely more on the Declaration of Independence than the U.S. Constitution, a decision Wills says represented a &#34;revolution in thought.&#34; He speaks effusively of the 272-word address: &#34;All modern political prose descends from [it]. The Address does what all great art accomplishes. [I]t tease[s] us out of thought.&#34; Wills&#39; book won the 1992 National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism.<b>Garry Wills,</b> former Henry R.

VOL. VI., P. 105.</i></p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b> One of the last untold stories of World War II is also one</b> of the greatest. It&#x2019;s a story of adventure, daring, danger, and heroics followed by a web of conspiracy, lies, and cover-up.</p><p>The story of Operation Halyard, the rescue of 512 Allied airmen trapped behind enemy lines, is one of the greatest rescue and escape stories ever, but almost no one has heard about it. And that is by design. The U.S., British, and Yugoslav governments hid details of this story for decades, purposefully denying credit to the heroic rescuers and the foreign ally who gave his life to help Allied airmen as they were hunted down by Nazis in the hills of Yugoslavia.</p><p>Operation Halyard was the largest rescue ever of downed American airmen and one of the largest such operations in the war or since. Hundreds of U.S. airmen were rescued, along with some from other countries, right under the noses of the Germans and mostly in broad daylight. The mission was a complete success, the kind that should have been trumpeted in newsreels and published on the front page of the newspapers. But it wasn&#x2019;t.</p><p>It is a little-known episode that started with one edge-of-your-seat rescue in August 1944, followed by a series of additional rescues over several months. American agents from the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor of the CIA, worked with a Serbian guerilla, General Draza Mihailovich, to carry out the huge, ultrasecret rescue mission.</p><p>These are the tales of young airmen shot down in the hills of Yugoslavia during bombing runs and the four secret agents who conducted their amazing rescue. These are the stories of young men&#x2014;many of them first-generation Americans, the proud, patriotic sons of European immigrants&#x2014;who were eager to join the war and fight the Germans, even finding excitement in the often deadly trips from Italy to bomb German oil fields in Romania, but who found themselves parachuting out of crippled planes and into the arms of strange, rough-looking villagers in a country they knew nothing about. They soon found that the local Serbs were willing to sacrifice their own lives to keep the downed airmen out of German hands, but they still wondered if anyone was coming for them or if they would spend the rest of the war hiding from German patrols and barely surviving on goats&#x2019; milk and bread baked with hay to make it more filling.</p><p>When the OSS in Italy heard of the stranded airmen, the agents began to plan an elaborate and previously unheard-of rescue&#x2014;the Americans would send in a fleet of C-47 cargo planes to land in the hills of Yugoslavia, behind enemy lines, to pluck out hundreds of airmen. It was audacious and risky beyond belief, but there was no other way to get those boys out of German territory. The list of challenges and potential problems seemed never ending: The airmen had to evade capture until the rescue could be organized; they had to build an airstrip large enough for C-47s without any tools and without the Germans finding out; then the planes had to make it in and out without being shot down.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b> The setting for this dramatic</b> chapter in history is a region that, for modern-day Americans, has become synonymous with brutal civil war, sectarian violence, and atrocities carried out in the name of ethnic cleansing&#x2014;an impression that, though it may ignore the region&#x2019;s rich cultural history, is not inaccurate. Serbia covers the central part of the Balkan Peninsula, also known as the Balkans, a region in southern Europe separated from Italy by the Adriatic Sea. Serbia borders Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; Albania and the Republic of Macedonia to the south; and Montenegro, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west.</p><p>Throughout history the area has been neighbor to great empires, a proximity that contributed to a rich mixture of ethnicities and cultures, but also to a long history dominated by wars and clashes between rival groups of the same country. The fractious nature of the region even led to the term &#x201c;Balkanization&#x201d; or &#x201c;Balkanizing&#x201d; as a shorthand for splintering into rival political entities, usually through violence. The word &#x201c;Balkan&#x201d; itself is commonly used to imply religious strife and civil war.</p><p>The former Yugoslavia is a region seemingly in a constant state of flux. During World War II, Serbia was part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which then became the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1945. In 1992 the country was renamed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, then the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro from 2003 to 2006. When Montenegro voted independence from the State Union, Serbia officially proclaimed its independence on June 5, 2006.</p><p>Serbian borders and regions are determined largely by natural formations, including the Carpathian Mountains and the Balkan Mountains, which create the mountainous region that formed a hurdle for crippled American bombers trying to return to their bases in Italy, but which also sheltered downed fliers from the German patrols hunting them.</p><p>From the 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria at Sarajevo, which set off World War I, to the Nazi occupation in World War II, the region was in the center of global conflicts while contending with its own internal strife. The former Yugoslavia is a mix of different ethnic and religious groups, including Serbs, Croats, Muslims, and Slo- venes. Throughout history, ancient and recent, most of the fighting in the region has been a struggle among these groups for the control of territory. After World War II, the Bosnian Muslims were strong supporters of Communist leader Josip Broz Tito, partly because he was successful at keeping the ethnic groups peaceful&#x2014;just as Italian dictator Benito Mussolini made the trains run on time. Serbs were the most populous ethnic group in the former Yugoslavia, with a national identity rooted in the Serbian Orthodox Church.</p><p>After World War I, the Serb monarchy dominated the new nation of Yugoslavia. During World War II, hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, and Gypsies were killed by Croat Fascists, called Ustashe, and by Germans. Some Muslims fought for the Nazis, while many other Muslims and Croats fought for the Partisans led by Tito. Serbs supported the exiled royal government.</p><p>These age-old hatreds and ethnic disputes erupted in 1992 to cause the bloodiest fighting on European soil since World War II. More than two hundred thousand people, most of them civilians, were killed and millions more were left homeless. As the fighting raged and the world learned of atrocities committed against civilian populations simply for being of the wrong ethnic background, European nations responded with numerous peace proposals that produced no peace. Then the United States moderated peace talks at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. The talks led to a November 21, 1995, peace accord that relied on sixty thousand NATO troops to stop the killing.</p><p>The Bosnian war of the 1990s was particularly vicious. While Serbs are generally considered the aggressors in the Bosnian conflict of the 1990s, there also are legitimate charges that Croats and Muslims operated prison camps and committed war crimes. Some critics accused former Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic of looking the other way while his Muslim soldiers committed war crimes in retaliation against Serb attacks. Many Serbs acknowledge the well-documented atrocities committed by Bosnian Serb militia against Muslim and Croat civilians, but they also argue that Serb civilians were the victims of similar crimes and that the Western media coverage was skewed by a bias in favor of the Muslim and Croat sides.</p><p>The Dayton accord did not completely end the violence in the region. Between 1998 and 1999, continued clashes in Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia, between Serbian and Yugoslav security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army prompted a NATO aerial bombardment that lasted for seventy-eight days. The peace among Serbs, Croats, and Muslims in the area of the former Yugoslavia still is a fragile one.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b> American fliers who parachuted out</b> of their bombers over Yugoslavia in World War II had little idea of the complex, troubled history of the country in which they were about to land, or of the international disputes in which they were about to become entangled. They sought refuge and a way back home, and they were humbled by the outpouring of support from the poor Serb villagers who risked their own lives to help the Americans drifting down out of the sky.</p><p>As the world came to know only the modern-day violence of the Bosnian wars, there was a small band of men who knew that the people in that distant country had once done a great service to the American people and to many young men who were scared, tired, and hungry. They held on to that story and told everyone they knew, yet the story slowly died with the forgotten 500.</p><p>Only a handful of the rescued airmen and OSS agents are still alive to tell the stories, their health and memories fading fast. But they insist that the world know the truth of what happened in Yugoslavia in 1944, including the series of almost unbelievable coincidences and near misses&#x2014;everything from an improbable meeting with a top Nazi officer&#x2019;s wife to a herd of cows that show up at just the right moment&#x2014;that made their rescue possible.</p><p>They never forgot, and they refuse to let the story die with them.</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p><i><b>We&#x2019;ll Get Them Out</b></i></p><p><i><b>Yugoslavia, August 1944</b></i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b> This village seemed just like every other village Clare</b> Musgrove had been through in the last four days, simple stone and thatch houses with minimal furnishings and even less food, occupied by people who welcomed him even though he had no idea who they were or what they intended to do with him. The smoke of a long-smoldering fireplace mixed with the earthy aroma of wet hay and livestock, the same pungent smells that permeated every one of these villages. Following the gesture of his armed escort, he entered the small house and looked nervously around, trying to assess what might happen. For all he knew, this was it; this was where they were bringing him. Was it some sort of safe house where he could hide from the Germans without running all the time? He had wondered that at every village where he and the other American airmen stopped in the past days, but each one turned out to be just a waypoint on a journey to . . . somewhere.

Eight days later, France accepted a humiliating defeat and foreign occupation. Subsequently, an eerie sense of normalcy settled over the City of Light. Many Parisians keenly adapted themselves to the situation-even allied themselves with their Nazi overlords. At the same time, amidst this darkening gloom of German ruthlessness, shortages, and curfews, a resistance arose. Parisians of all stripes-Jews, immigrants, adolescents, communists, rightists, cultural icons such as Colette, de Beauvoir, Camus and Sartre, as well as police officers, teachers, students, and store owners-rallied around a little known French military officer, Charles de Gaulle. <br><br>WHEN PARIS WENT DARK evokes with stunning precision the detail of daily life in a city under occupation, and the brave people who fought against the darkness. Relying on a range of resources---memoirs, diaries, letters, archives, interviews, personal histories, flyers and posters, fiction, photographs, film and historical studies---Rosbottom has forged a groundbreaking book that will forever influence how we understand those dark years in the City of Light.<br><br></p><p>Ronald C.

Book available.</p><p>With a title like this, it's no surprise that authors Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish had a monster bestseller on their hands when the book first appeared in 1988. From the subsequent deluge of readers' stories, questions, and issues, they have created nearly 50 pages of new material for this, the 10th anniversary edition. The central message remains the same, and sounds almost too simple: avoid comparisons. But parents know that's easier said than done. The value of Faber and Mazlish's discussions is precisely that they talk you through umpteen different situations and outcomes to help you teach your brawling offspring a new set of responses. The highly informative text is punctuated with helpful summary/reminder boxes and cartoons illustrating key points. It's a must-read for parents with (or planning on) multiple children. But parents of young children who get along fine (so far) should read it too--as the authors make very clear, rivalry is inevitable. The only question is how to manage the rivalry with intelligence and compassion, and on that subject they offer a wealth of good advice. <i>--Richard Farr</i><br><p>Internationally acclaimed experts on communication between adults and children, Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish have won the gratitude of parents and the enthusiastic endorsement of the professional community. </p><p>Their first book, <i>Liberated Parents/Liberated Children,</i> received the Christopher Award for "literary achievement affirming the highest values of the human spirit."

Within the next 24 hours, Regina has disappeared, with her car but without her clothes or her baby; and her ne'er-do-well husband Craig has been found, a hatchet through his head, on the stairs leading to their garage apartment. Then his best friend and former jailmate Rory also turns up, appearing stunned by Craig's death. It's soon decided that Hayden will have to be brought back to Corinth, Ohio, where Martin grew up and where there are relatives who might take the baby in. Martin owns an old, refurbished farmhouse on the outskirts of town where Craig and Regina had been living. Now, he and Roe can stay there until matters are settled. Once arrived, Roe struggles with the complex details of child care as she and Martin try to find the reason for Regina's disappearance and a permanent home for the baby.

Ellison lives in Nashville with her husband and twin kittens.</p><br><br><em>Nashville, Tennessee October 31 3:30 p.m.</em><br><br>Taylor Jackson stood at attention, arms behind her back, her dress blues itching her wrists. She was feeling more than a bit embarrassed. She'd asked for this to be done without ceremony, just a simple here you go, you're back in our good graces, but the chief was having nothing of it. He'd insisted she not only receive her lieutenant's badge again, but be decorated as well, in a very public ceremony. Her union rep was thrilled, and at her direction, had dropped the lawsuit she'd been forced to file against the department when they demoted her without cause. Taylor was pleased, as well. She'd been fighting to get reinstated, and she had to admit it was nice to put all of this behind her. But the pomp and circumstance was a bit much.<br><br>It had been a long afternoon. Taylor felt like a show pony, was flushed with the overly exuberant praise of her career, her involvement in catching the Conductor, a serial killer who'd killed two women back-to-back, kidnapped a third and fled Nashville with Taylor hot on his heels. She'd arrested him in Italy, and the story had immediately caught international headlines, because at the same time, she'd been party to the capture of one of Italy's most notorious serial killers, Il Macellaio. In the world of sound bites and news at your fingertips, taking two serial killers into custody had garnered so much attention that the chief had been forced into action.<br><br>Not only was she being reinstated; Taylor had command of the murder squad again, and her team was being reassembled. Detectives Lincoln Ross and Marcus Wade were shipped back up from the South Sector, and after a long discussion with the chief, she'd even talked him into allowing Renn McKenzie to become part of the permanent team. She had her boys back.<br><br>Most of them.<br><br>Pete Fitzgerald had fallen off the face of the earth. Taylor had last talked to him when he was in Barbados, anchored and waiting for a new part for his boat's engine. He'd called to let her know he thought he'd seen their old nemesis, and she hadn't heard from him since. She was sick with worry, convinced that Fitz had been taken by the Pretender, a killer so obscene, so cruel that he invaded her dreams and consumed her waking moments. A killer Taylor hadn't caught; the one who'd quite literally gotten away.<br><br>Her concerns had been compounded just last week, when the Coast Guard had picked up a distress signal off the coast of North Carolina. The GPS beacon matched the registered number for Fitz's boat. Despite countless days of searching, nothing had been found. The Coast Guard had been forced to call off the search, and the police in North Carolina couldn't get involved because there was no crime to be investigated. She had a call in to the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigations, in the hope they would see things differently, but she hadn't heard anything yet.<br><br>Taylor tried to shake off the thought of Fitz, of his body broken and battered, of what the Pretender was doing to him, or had done. The guilt spilled through her blood, making it chilly. She'd issued a challenge to the Pretender, told him to come and get her. Instead, she was positive he'd taken her friend, the man closest to her, aside from Baldwin. Her father figure. She had probably gotten Fitz killed, and she found that knowledge desperately hard to stomach.<br><br>She looked into the crowd, the sea of blue seated in compact rows before her. John Baldwin, her fianc�, sat in the front, grinning. His hair was too long again, the black waves falling over his forehead and ears in a tumble. She resisted the urge to roll her eyes; that was sure to get on the evening news, and she didn't want any more attention than she already had. She touched her engagement ring instead, twisting the channel-set diamonds around her finger.<br><br>Her team sat beside him: Lincoln Ross, hair grown out just enough to slip in some tiny dreadlocks; Marcus Wade, brown-eyed and sweetly happy. He was getting serious with his girlfriend, and Taylor had never seen him so content. The new member of the team, Renn McKenzie, was at Marcus's left. Taylor saw McKenzie's partner, Hugh Bangor, a few rows back. They'd been very discreet&#x2014;only Taylor and Baldwin knew they were an item.<br><br>Even her old boss Mitchell Price was there, smiling benevolently at her. He'd been a casualty of the events that led to Taylor losing her badge in the first place, but had moved on. He was running a personal protection service catering to country music stars, and had made it clear that anytime Taylor wanted to bail on Nashville Metro, she was welcome to join him.<br><br>Fitz was the only one missing. She forced the lump in her throat away.<br><br>The chief was pinning something to her uniform now. He stood back with a wide smile and started clapping. The audience followed suit, and Taylor wished she could disappear. This was not what she wanted, this open, public enthusiasm on her behalf.<br><br>The chief gestured to the microphone. Taylor took a deep breath and stepped to the podium.<br><br>"Thank you all for being here today. I appreciate it more than you know. But we really should be honoring the entire team who participated. I couldn't have done any of this without the help of Detective Renn McKenzie, Supervisory Special Agent John Baldwin, Detective James Highsmythe of the London Metropolitan Police, and all the officers of the Metro Police who participated, in small ways and in large, on the case. The city of Nashville owes these men and women a debt of gratitude. Now, enough of the hoopla. Let's go back to work."<br><br>Laughter rippled through the crowd, and they clapped again. Lincoln whistled, two fingers stuck in his mouth, and this time she did roll her eyes. Baldwin winked at her, his clear green gaze full of pride. With her back ramrod straight and her ears burning, she thanked the chief and the other dignitaries, nodded at her new boss, Commander Joan Huston, and made her way off the dais. People began milling about; the language of the force rang in her ears like a mother's lullaby. She was back, and it felt damn good.<br><br>Baldwin met her, took her hand. "So how's the Investigator of the Year?"<br><br>She took a deep breath and blew it out noisily. "Don't start," she said. "This is mortifying enough as it is."<br><br>He laughed and kissed her palm. A promise for later.<br><br>Lincoln and Marcus both hugged her, and McKenzie shook her hand.<br><br>"Congratulations, LT!" Lincoln's gap-toothed smile felt like coming home, and she clapped him on the back. Price joined their group, shaking her hand gravely, his red handlebar mustache neatly trimmed and waxed for the occasion.<br><br>"What's your first act as a newly restored lieutenant, Loot?" Marcus asked.<br><br>"Buying y'all a beer. It is Halloween, after all. Let's get out of here. How about we head down to Mulligan's and grab a Guinness?"<br><br>"You're on," Marcus said.<br><br>She gestured to her stiffly starched uniform. "I just need to change."<br><br>"Us, too. Race you to the locker rooms."<br><br>Ten minutes later, once again in civilian clothes&#x2014;jeans, cowboy boots, a black cashmere turtleneck and gray corduroy blazer, left open&#x2014;Taylor felt much more comfortable. She snapped her holster onto her belt, then risked a glance at her shield. Her phantom limb. Losing it had just about cost her everything. She lovingly caressed the gold for the briefest of moments, then attached it to her belt in front of her holster. Complete. Again. She slammed her locker shut and met the boys in the hall. She saw Baldwin's eyes stray to her waist and pretended she didn't see his satisfied smile.<br><br>As they left the Criminal Justice Center, Taylor's spirits lifted. The joshing, joking group of men behind her, Baldwin in step at her side, all served to remind her how lucky she was. Now, if she could only find Fitz and do away with the Pretender, life would be grand indeed.<br><br>They'd just passed Hooters when Taylor's cell rang. She looked at the screen, saw it was dispatch. She held up a hand and stopped on the sidewalk to answer.<br><br>"Jackson," she said.<br><br>"Lieutenant, we need your response at a 10-64J, possible homicide, 3800 Estes Road. Repeat, 10-64J."<br><br>The <em>J </em>designator made a shiver go up her spine. /meant the victim was a juvenile. She hated working crimes with kids involved.<br><br>"Roger that, Dispatch. I'm on my way." She slapped the phone shut. "Hey, guys, I'm sorry. I've got to go to this scene." She pulled her wallet out of her jacket's interior pocket and handed Lincoln two twenties. He shook his head.<br><br>"Hell, no, LT. You're back on the job, so are we."<br><br>"But you're not on today. Go on ahead."<br><br>"No way," Marcus said. They lined up shoulder to shoulder, a wall of testosterone and insistence. She knew better than to fight. They were all just as happy as she was to be back together.<br><br>"I'll drive," McKenzie offered.<br><br>She smiled at them, then turned to Baldwin. "Well, aren't you coming, too?"<br><br>"What, the Nashville police want the help of a profiler?" he teased, his green eyes flashing.<br><br>"Of course we do. Come on then, let's go. We'll have to take two cars."<br><br>They drove up West End, McKenzie in the lead, Taylor and Baldwin following. Getting to Green Hills at this time of day was difficult at best, the traffic stop-and-start, so McKenzie was leading them through the back roads. Up West End, then left on Bowling, through the gloriously wooded neighborhoods, wide green lawns, large homes set far back from the main streets.<br><br>Many of the houses were decorated for Halloween, some professionally, with complete horror tableaus on their front yards: Black-and-orange twinkling lights and tombstones and full-size mummies&#x2014;some crafted with the obvious hand of a child&#x2014;fake spider webs and friendly ghosts. On the corner of Bowling and Woodmont there was a large inflatable headless horseman. It was starting to get dark, and there had been rain earlier in the day. Fog rose in wispy streams from the lawns. A few jack-o'-lanterns had been lit, their insides glowing with sinister comfort.<br><br>Once they turned left onto Estes, it only took a moment to reach the address. The first responders&#x2014;firefighters and EMTs&#x2014;had already left. Patrol cars littered the street, crime-scene tape was strung across the road. Blue-and-white lights flashed in the evening sky, reflecting off the brick houses. Farther down the street, moving away from the commotion, small groups had started floating from door to door; the youngest trick-or-treaters escorted by their parents before full dark set in. Even if it hadn't been Halloween, it would have been an eerie scene.<br><br>Paula Simari was there, standing by her patrol car. Her canine partner, Max, was in the backseat, grinning a doggie smile at the activity. His services had not been needed tonight, it seemed.<br><br>The five of them approached and Paula held up her hands. "Whoa. No need to bring out all the big guns. Just one body up there." She gestured over her shoulder at the second story of an expansive Georgian red brick house. "How's it being back in charge, Lieutenant?"<br><br>"Very nice, Officer." Taylor liked Simari. She was good people, always ready with a quip, but knew when to be serious. "Why don't you brief us, then we'll take a cruise through the scene." She signed in to the crime-scene call sheet, then handed the pen to Baldwin. By the book, that was her new middle name.<br><br>"Sure. Body is that of a seventeen-year-old male Caucasian, name Jerrold King. His sister, Letha, came home from shopping with friends&#x2014;they both go to Hillsboro but they had a half day today. It's a teachers' in-service afternoon. Said she went into his room to borrow a CD and found him naked on the bed. She called 911 and they responded, but he was deceased when they arrived."<br><br>"Suicide?" Taylor asked.<br><br>"Not exactly," Simari replied grimly. "Not unless he was into pain."<br><br>"Pain?" Baldwin said, eyebrow raised.<br><br>Simari bit her lip. "I think you should see this for yourself. That's why I had dispatch call you directly."<br><br>Taylor looked at her for a long moment, then shrugged. "Okay. Let's go. Baldwin, you're with me. Marcus, Lincoln, could you start chatting with the crowd?" She pointed to the driveway of the house next door, which was accumulating people, some dressed in costumes, some obviously just home from a day at the office. The suits outnumbered the costumes three to one. "See if anyone saw anything. McKenzie? Make sure the medical examiner is on the way. We need a death investigator and crime-scene techs."<br><br>"Will do."<br><br>She followed Simari up the elaborate steps of the house, through white Doric columns onto a wide brick porch. A trio of witches nestled in between two spider-webbed rocking chairs; dual arrays of orange chrysanthemums in black wrought-iron planters were parked on either side of the door, their blossoms bright and new.<br><br>Taylor took a second to wind her hair into a bun and secure it, slipped her hands into purple nitrile gloves. Baldwin followed suit&#x2014;their hands suddenly all professional, no more the recipients of holy palmers' kiss. They couldn't afford to confuse the crime-scene techs with their own DNA, nor allow their personal relationship to affect the case. It had been difficult for Taylor at first, pretending she and Baldwin weren't emotionally entwined. It was easier now. She was learning his detachment skills.<br><br>Simari was already gloved up, and let them in.<br><br>A teenager with rough skin and a jet-black bob sat at the foot of the stairs, white and shaking. She had black circles under her eyes and the faintest trace of dark lipstick in one corner of her mouth. Her lips were jammed together in a thin line; it seemed she knew if she opened her mouth the world would collapse.<br><br>"Lieutenant Jackson, this is Letha King. She found the body."<br><br>Taylor bent at the waist to get to the girl's level. "Letha. I'm so sorry for your loss. Are your parents on their way home?"<br><br>The girl didn't meet her eye, just shook her head. Simari stepped in. "They're out of town. We're tracking them down now."<br><br>Letha wrapped her arms around her waist, trying to hold herself together. Her nails were painted black, the polish wearing away. Taylor was tempted to reach out and touch her, to give a bit of warmth, of comfort, but refrained. She needed to see the body first, then she could worry about the living.<br><br>She stepped back onto the porch and whistled at McKenzie. He was on his cell phone, raised his eyebrows in question. She gestured for him to come to her. He nodded, said something briefly into the cell, then slapped it shut and bounded up the stairs. Taylor spoke quietly.<br><br>"I've got the victim's sister in the house. Kid's completely shattered. She needs to have someone with her. Would you mind?"<br><br>"Not at all. Everyone's on their way."<br><br>"Great, thanks. Come with me."<br><br>They reentered the house, and Taylor led McKenzie to Letha.<br><br></p><h2>Tales of the Alhambra (Import)</h2><p>Irving, Washington, Tales Of The Alhambra</p><p></p><h2>Lean Six Sigma and Minitab (4th Edition): The Complete Toolbox Guide for Business Improvement</h2><p><b>**Fourth Edition: Updated for Minitab 17, more Lean tools, improved graphics**</b><p> The Lean Six Sigma and Minitab guide explains Lean Six Sigma in a down-to-earth and practical format, and provides detailed Minitab instructions and screenshots throughout.</p><p> Now in its 4th edition with over 100,000 copies sold, this Lean Six Sigma guide is firmly established as <b>the</b> practical guide for business improvement professionals worldwide.</p><p> <b>The guide includes:</b><br> - Over 135 Lean Six Sigma tools and techniques.<br> - Logical routemaps through the Six Sigma DMAIC flow.<br> - Detailed Minitab instructions and screenshots.<br> - Clear diagrams and explanations.<br> - Easy-to-navigate format with DMAIC tabs.<br> - Interactive examples with free data files and templates.</p><p> <b>Who should use this book?</b><br> - Lean Six Sigma trainees.<br> - Improvement practitioners delivering real life Six Sigma projects.<br> - Project Sponsors overseeing Six Sigma projects.<br> - Senior managers requiring an introduction to Lean and Six Sigma.</p></p><p>This successful Lean Six Sigma pocket guide provides a unique combination of practical advice on the Lean Six Sigma tools alongside detailed instructions for the Minitab software where applicable.The toolbox guide is targeted at the clear need that existed for a down to earth &#39;pocket sized&#39; guide to Six Sixma and Minitab.</p><h2>Herbs for Natural Beauty</h2><p>One of America&#39;s foremost herbalists provides concise, simple-to-understand, and practical information for using herbs for health and well-being.

The melancholy of seeing things for the last time is the highly mysterious and poetic essence that these images leave with us. It is as though Andrei wanted to transmit his own enjoyment quickly to others. And they feel like a fond farewell."</em>Tonino Guerra, from the Introduction<br><br> This beautifully produced book comprises sixty Polaroid photographs of Andrei Tarkovsky's friends and family, taken between 1979 and 1984 in his native Russia and in Italy, where he spent time in political exile.The size of the Polaroids is exactly as presented in the book, including the frame. The book may therefore be viewed as a facsimile edition. 60 color illustrations.</p><p><p><strong>Giovanni Chiaramonte</strong> is a distinguished Italian photographer. His images center around the relationship between place and destiny in Western civilization, a theme he shares with Andrey Tarkovsky.</p><p><strong>Andrey Tarkovsky</strong> was a Russian director, writer and actor. He is regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers of the Soviet era in Russia and one of the greatest in movie history. Among his films are Solaris, Mirror, Stalker, and Nosalghia. He died in 1986.</p><p><strong>Tonino Guerra</strong>'s narrative talents have provided screenplays for film directors as diverse as Theo Angelopoulos, Michaelangelo Antonioni, Vittorio De Sica, Frederico Fellini and the Taviani brothers, as well as Andrey Tarkovsky.</p>The Russian Andrey Tarkovsky (1932-1986) is one of the greatest directors in film history. Here Italian photographer Chiaramonte and Tarkovsky's son mount a selection of color Polaroids the filmmaker took from 1979 to 1984 of his home, family, and friends in Russia and of places he visited in Italy. His father, Arseny, was a distinguished poet, and judging from the notebook extracts accompanying the pictures, Tarkovsky was no mean poet himself. Like his father, he intuited a holy eternity. Those windows into eternity, the icons of the Orthodox Church, influenced his visual style (his <i>Andrei Rublev</i> commemorates the greatest icon painter), and these photos, suffused by the ochre light of late afternoon and so powerfully composed that they argue that supreme artistic visualization was second nature to Tarkovsky, look so timeless and enduring that they inspire worshipful awe. Like some of the imagery of <i>The Mirror</i>, the Tarkovsky film these pictures most resemble, some of them tax and frustrate legibility. Always, they affirm a line of Arseny Tarkovsky's, "We are all immortal." <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

What made a New York stockbroker spend even more than that to have the image of Charlie Chaplin painted on his cat&#39;�?s posterior? WHY PAINT CATS reveals that, far from being an amusement for the idle rich, this seemingly aberrant behavior is part of a new art movement that claims to promote a better understanding of the cats in our lives. Following the international success of their previous collaboration of feline aesthetics, WHY CATS PAINT, Burton Silver and Heather Busch turn their scholarly attention to the cat as canvas. The authors detail all the latest trends in the movement, including the highly controversial Retromingent Expressionism, drawing conclusions that will provoke and amuse, startle, and enlighten. Exhaustively researched and lavishly illustrated, this insightful and engaging book raises important ethical questions and explores the rights of pet owners to reinvent their cats in the name of art.</p><p>�Busch&#x2019;s singular photographic studies combine with Silver&#x2019;s in-depth interviews of artists and owners in this landmark work on cats, art, and their unlikely intersection. <p>�The authors&#x2019; WHY CATS PAINT has sold over 500,000 copies worldwide.</p>BURTON SILVER is a cartoonist, inventor, and author of more than a dozen books, including the best-selling WHY CATS PAINT.

He and his wife, Christy, live in Jacksonville, Florida.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p> <p><em> </em> Maybe it's the July showers that appear at 3:00 p.m., regular as sunshine, maybe it's the September hurricanes that cut a swath across the Atlantic and then dump their guts at landfall, or maybe it's just God crying on Florida, but whatever it is, and however it works, the St. Johns River is and always has been the soul of Florida. </p> <p> It collects in the mist, south of Osceola, and then unlike most every other river in the world, except the Nile, it winds northward, swelling as it flows. Overflowing at Lake George, underground rivers crack crystal springs in the earth's crust and send it sailing farther northward where it gives rise to commerce, trade, million-dollar homes, and Jacksonville--once commonly referred to as Cowford--because that's where the cows forded the river. </p> <p> South of Jacksonville, the river's waist bulges to three miles wide, sparking little spurs or creeks peopled by barnacled marinas and long-established fish camps where the people are good and most of their stories are as winding as the river. A few miles south and east of the naval air station--headquarters to several squadrons of the huge, droning, four-propeller P-3 Orion--Julington Creek is a small bulge in the waistband that turns east out of the river, dips under State Road 13, winds beneath a canopy of majestic oaks, and disappears into the muck of a virgin Florida landscape. </p> <p> On the south bank of Julington Creek, surrounded by rows of orange and grapefruit trees, Spiraling Oaks Mental Health Facility occupies a little more than ten acres of black, rich, organic, worm-crawling dirt. If decay has a smell, this is it. It's shaded by sprawling live oak trees whose limbs twist upward like arms and outward like tentacles, the tips of which are heavily laden with ten million acorns horded by fat, noisy, scurrying squirrels wary of hawks, owls, and ospreys. </p> <p> Spiraling Oaks is where people go, or are sent, when their families don't know what else to do with them. If there's a precipice to insanity, this is it. It's the last stop before the nuthouse, although in truth, it is just that. </p> <p> By 10:00 a.m., the morning shift had changed, but not before administering the required doses of Zoloft, Zyprexa, Lithium, Prozac, Respidol, Haldol, Prolixen, Thorazine, Selaxa, Paxil, or Depakote to all forty-seven patients. Lithium was the staple, the base ingredient in all their diets, as all but two patients had blood levels in the therapeutic range. The other two were new admissions and soon to follow. This practice gave rise to its nickname--Lithiumville--which was funny to everyone but the patients. More than half the patients were taking a morning cocktail of lithium plus one. About a quarter of the patients, the more serious cases, were swallowing lithium plus two. Only a handful were ingesting lithium plus three. These were the lifers. The go-figures. The no-hopers. The why-were-they-borns. </p> <p> The campus buildings were all one story. That way, none of the patients could step out of a second-story window. The main patient building, Wagemaker Hall, formed a semicircle with several nurses' stations spaced strategically six rooms apart. Tiled floors, scenically painted rooms, soft music, and cheerful employees. The whole place smelled like a deep-muscle rub--soothing and aromatic. </p> <p> The patient in room 1 was a two-year occupant and at fifty-two, a veteran of three such facilities. Known as "the computer man," he was once a rather gifted programmer, responsible for high-security government mainframes. But all that programming had gone to his head, because he now believed he had a computer inside of him that told him what to do and where to go. He was excitable, hyper, and often needed staff assistance to navigate the halls, eat, or find the bathroom--which he seldom did in time or in the appropriate place. That fact alone explained the smell. He fluctuated between climbing the walls and being catatonic. There was no in-between and had not been in some time. He was either up or down. On or off. Yes or no. He had not spoken in at least a year, his face often frozen in a grimace and his body held in odd postures--evidence of the internal conversation occurring inside the shell of a man who once had an IQ of 186 or greater. Chances were quite good that he'd leave Spiraling Oaks strapped to a stretcher and carrying a one-way ticket to a downtown facility where all the doors led in and all the rooms were decorated with blue, four-inch padding. </p> <p> The patient in room two was female, twenty-seven, relatively new, and currently asleep under a rather potent dose of 1,200 milligrams of Thorazine. She would pose no problem today, tomorrow, or, for that matter, through the weekend. Neither would the psychotic tendencies that slept under the same sedation. Three days ago her husband had knocked on the front door and asked to admit her. This occurred shortly after her mania, and nineteenth grandiose scheme, had emptied their bank account and given $67,000 in cash to a man who claimed to have created a gizmo that doubled the gas mileage in every car on earth. The stranger gave no receipt and, like the money, was never seen again. </p> <p> The patient in room 3 had turned forty-eight several times in his three years here and now stood at the nurses' counter and asked, "What time does the Zest begin?" When the nurse didn't respond, he pounded the desk and said, "The ship has come and I'm going nowhere. If you tell God, I'll die." When she just smiled, he started pacing back and forth, mumbling to himself. His speech was pressured, his mind was racing through a thousand brilliant ideas a second, and his stomach was growling because, convinced his stomach was in hell, he hadn't eaten in three days. He was euphoric, hallucinating with detail, and about five seconds from his next glass of cranberry juice--the nurses' syringe of choice. </p> <p> By 10:15 a.m., the thirty-three-year-old patient in room 6 had not eaten his applesauce. Instead, he peered from around the bathroom door and eyed it with suspicion. He had been here seven years and was the last of the lithium-plus-three patients. He knew about the lithium, Tegretol, and Depakote, but he couldn't quite figure out where they were putting the 100 milligrams of Thorazine twice a day. He knew they were putting it somewhere, but in the last few months he had simply been too continually groggy to know where. After seven years in room 6, the staff here could pretty well predict that he would cycle seven to eight times a year. During those times, the patient had responded best to stepped-down doses of Thorazine over a two-week period. This had been explained to the patient several times, and he understood this, but that didn't mean he liked it. He fit in well, although at thirty-three, he was much younger than the median age of forty-seven. His dark hair was thinning and receding, and a few gray hairs now surfaced around his ears. To hide the gray, but not the balding and the recession, he kept it cropped pretty close. This trait was unlike his brother, Tucker, whom the patient had not seen since he dropped him off at the front door seven years ago. </p> <p> Matthew Mason got his nickname in second grade when, on the first day of class, he wrote his name in cursive. Miss Ella had been working with him at the kitchen table, and he was only too proud to show his teacher that he knew his cursive letters. His only problem was that on this particular day, he didn't close the loop on the top of the <em>a</em>. So instead of an<em> a</em>, the teacher read <em>u</em> and the name stuck. So did the laughter, finger-pointing, and snickering. Ever since, he'd been Mutt Mason. </p> <p> His olive skin made him think his mother was either Spanish or Mexican. But it was anybody's guess. His father was a squatty, fat man with fair skin and a tendency for skin moles. Mutt had those too. He looked from the tray to the bathroom mirror and noticed how his once well-fitting clothes looked baggy and hung one size too big. He studied his shoulders and asked himself if he had shrunk in his time here, the seventh time he had asked that question today. Although he had put on three pounds in the last year, he was down from his preadmission weight of 175 pounds. His Popeye forearms, once bulging with strength and hammer-wielding power, were now taut and sinewy. Currently, he was 162 pounds--his exact weight on the day they buried Miss Ella. His dark eyes and eyebrows matched his skin--reminding him that he once tanned easily. Now, fluorescent lights were the extent of his UV exposure. </p> <p> His hands had weakened and the calluses long since gone soft. The sweaty young boy who once arm-climbed the rope to the top of the water tower or rode one-handed down the zip line no longer looked back at him in the mirror. He liked the water, liked the view from the tower, liked the thrill of the fall as the zip handle caught and flung him forward, liked the sound of the windmill as it sucked water up the two-inch pipe from the quarry and filled the pool-like bowl standing some twenty feet off the ground. He thought of Tucker and his water-green eyes. He listened for Tucker's quiet voice and tender confidence, but of all the voices in his head, Tucker's was not among them. </p> <p> He thought of the barn, of hitting chert rocks with a splintery wooden bat, and of how, as Tucker got older, the back wall of the barn looked like Swiss cheese. He thought of swimming in the quarry, eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on the back porch with Miss Ella, running through the shoulder-height hay at daylight, and climbing onto the roof of Waverly Hall under a cloudless, moonlit night just to peek at the world around him. The thought of that place brought a smile to his face--which was odd given its history. </p> <p> He thought of the massive stone-and-brick walls, the weeping mortar that held them together and spilled out the cracks between the two; the black slate tiles stacked like fish scales one atop the other on the roof; the gargoyles on the turrets that spouted water when it rained, and the copper gutters that hugged the house like exhaust pipes; he thought of the oak front door that was four inches thick and the brass door knocker that looked like a lion's face and took two hands to lift, the tall ceilings filled with old art and four rows of crown molding, the shelves of leather-bound books in the library that no one had ever read, and the ladder on wheels that rolled from one shelf to the next; he thought of the hollow sound of shoes on the tiled and marbled floors, the dining room table inlaid with gold that seated thirteen people on each side, and the rug beneath it that took a family of seven twenty-eight years to weave; he thought of the chimney sweeps that nested in the attic where he kept his toys, and then he thought of the rats in the basement where Rex kept his; he thought of the crystal chandelier hanging in the foyer that was as big around as the hood of a Cadillac, the grandfather clock that was always five minutes too fast and shook the walls when it chimed each morning at seven, and the bunk beds where he and Tucker fought alligators, Indians, Captain Hook, and nightmares; he thought of the long, winding stairs and the four-second slide down the wide, smooth railing, the smell and heat from the kitchen, and how his heart never left hungry; and then he thought of the sound of Miss Ella humming as she polished one of three silver sets, scrubbed the mahogany floors on her knees, or washed the windows that framed his world. </p> <p> Finally, he thought of that angry night, and the smile left his face. He thought of the months that followed, of Rex's distance and, for all practical purposes, disappearance. He thought of his own many years alone when he found safety amid the loneliness inside abandoned train cars rattling up and down the East Coast. Then he thought of the funeral, the long, quiet drive from Alabama, and the way Tucker walked off without ever saying good-bye. </p> <p> No description fit. Although <em>abandoned</em> got close. Rex had driven a permanent, intangible wedge between them, and it cut deeper than anyone cared to admit. In spite of Miss Ella's hopes, hugs, sermonettes, and callused knees, the blade, bloody and two-edged, proved too much, the pain too intertwined. He and Tucker had retreated, buried the memory, and in time, each other. Rex had won. </p> <p> In one of her front-porch sermons spoken from the pulpit of her rocker, Miss Ella had told him that if anger ever took root, it latched on, dug in, and choked the life out of whatever heart was carrying it. Turned out she was right, because now the vines were forearm-thick and formed an inflexible patchwork around his heart. Tucker's too. Mutt's was bad, but maybe Tuck's was the worst. Like a hundred-year-old wisteria, the vine had split the rock that once protected it. </p> <p> During his first six months at Spiraling Oaks, Mutt had responded so poorly to medication that his doctor prescribed and administered ECT--electroconvulsive therapy. As the name implies, patients are sedated, given a muscle relaxer to prevent injury during convulsion, and then shocked until their toes curl, their eyes roll back, and they pee in their pants. Supposedly, it works faster than medication, but in Mutt's case, some hurts live deeper than electricity can shock out. </p> <p> This was why Mutt eyed his applesauce. He had no desire to be strapped with electrodes and have a catheter shoved up his penis, but at this stage his paranoia had run rampant and there were only two venues left for them to sneak the medicine into his system: applesauce in the morning and chocolate pudding at night. They knew he enjoyed both, so compliance had never been a problem. Until now. </p> <p> Someone had dolloped the applesauce into a small Styrofoam cup on the corner of his tray and sprinkled a swirl of cinnamon into it. Except the cinnamon wasn't all on top. He glanced upward and sideways. Vicki, his long-legged nurse with Spanish eyes, long jet-black hair, short skirts, and a knack for chess, would be in here soon waving a spoon in front of his face and whispering, "Mutt, eat up." </p> <p> Mutt grew up growing his own apples and making his own applesauce--a childhood favorite--with Miss Ella every fall, but she didn't use the same ingredients. She pureed the apples, sometimes mixing in canned peaches they had put away that summer and maybe even a little cinnamon or vanilla extract, but she left out the secret ingredient now hidden beneath the cinnamon swirl. He liked Miss Ella's better. </p> <p> From his bedroom window, Mutt could see three prominent landmarks: Julington Creek, the Julington Creek Marina, and the back porch of Clark's Fish Camp. If he leaned far enough out the window, he could see the St. Johns. On several occasions, the staff had rented Gheenoes--sort of a canoe with a square stern that was impossible to overturn or sink. They'd launch from the marina and take patients on early afternoon strolls up the creek only to return the boats to the marina owner who affectionately referred to his across-the-creek neighbors as a "dang-sure bona fide nuthouse!" </p> <p> With one eye walking around the rim of the Styrofoam cup, Mutt glanced outside and admitted that in seven years, he'd heard and watched a lot of acor...</p></p><h2>The Source for Nonverbal Learning Disorders by Thompson, Sue (1997) Spiral-bound</h2><p>Sue Thompson&#39;s book demystifies the nature and needs of children with Nonverbal Learning Disabilities.

Ex-priest. Ex-public defender. Ex-husband. And as of yesterday, ex-partner at Simpson &amp; Gates, one of San Francisco's most prominent law firms. Today he's out on his own, setting up a private practice on the wrong side of town. Then his best friend and former colleague is charged with a brutal double murder. Daley has his first client--and is instantly catapulted into a high-profile case involving the prestigious law firm that just booted him.<br><br>The victims are one of Simpson &amp; Gates's most powerful partners and a beautiful young associate. There's a suicide note on the partner's computer, but neither the police nor the ambitious district attorney believe it's authentic--and they think the man they've arrested is the killer. It's up to Mike Daley to prove them wrong, but time is very short.<br><br>As Daley prepares his case, he begins to uncover the firm's dirtiest secrets--and dirty they are--but he also discovers that his friend, too, has a lot to hide. Even as the trial is under way, Daley and his investigators are still frantically digging for evidence that will clear their client. Against a chorus of morning press reports and nightly TV commentaries picking apart each day's session, Daley comes to realize that ambition, politics, greed, and long-standing grudges will play just as important a role in the outcome as truth and justice. This is the real world of law practice at work, and it's as ruthless as it is startling.<br><br>Brilliantly paced, witty, crackling with energy and suspense, <b>Special Circumstances</b> not only brings us to a stunning denouement; it zestfully reminds us why we love to hate lawyers--but can't get enough of courtroom drama when it's done this well.<br>In a stunning turn of events, Daley's best friend, an ex-colleague, is charged with the double murder of two lawyers at the old firm and asks Daley to defend him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cobbling together a defense team composed of himself, his ex-wife, and a onetime courtroom fixture named Mort Goldberg who's been wished on him against his better judgment, Daley finds he's got more to defend than his friend's innocence. The newly elected media-hungry District Attorn- ey, also a former colleague, will prosecute the case himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;As court is called into session, it becomes clear that in this trial ambition, honor, friendship, greed, and longstanding grudges will play as important a role as truth and justice.<br><br>Rarely has a legal thriller debut so accurately depicted not only the inner workings of the legal system but the crack-ling energy it takes to build and defend a felony case. In SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES author Sheldon Siegel reminds us why we love to hate lawyers -- but can't get enough of courtroom drama when it's done this well. --&gt;</p><p>With over a hundred mysteries and thrillers published each month, it's rare that a new book by an unknown author makes a splash, both with critics and with the public. John Grisham's <i>The Firm</i> was a cult hit among lawyers that exploded into <i>New York Times</i> bestsellerdom. Tom Clancy's <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>, first published by the Naval Institute Press, was discovered when Ronald Reagan labeled it a "perfect yarn." Sheldon Siegel's debut legal thriller, <i>Special Circumstances</i> is likely to take its place among these precious few.<p> The novel begins with the distinctive voice of Siegel's ex-priest hero: "After my five years as an underproductive partner in our white-collar criminal defense department, our executive committee asked me to leave. I was, in short, fired. On Monday I'll open the law offices of Michael J. Daley, criminal-defense attorney, in a subleased office in a walk-up building in the not-so-trendy part of San Francisco's South of Market area. Welcome to the modern practice of law...." </p><p> But on his final day of work, a senior partner turns up dead. A close colleague of Daley's is the most likely suspect, and Daley--in his new walk-up practice--takes the case. In a series of brilliantly executed twists and turns, he uncovers one layer of deception and intrigue after another to get to the root truth of the case. Meanwhile, Siegel--a San Francisco attorney himself--continues to pepper his first-person narrative with Daley's dead-on jabs at the world of courtroom warfare. Of the new San Francisco DA, for example, Daley comments: "As an attorney, he's careless, lazy and unimaginative. As a human being, he's greedy, condescending and an unapologetic philanderer. As a politician, however, he's the real deal."</p><p> While <i>Special Circumstances</i> is not a "perfect yarn," it is nearly so. As well-executed as most classic legal thrillers, it slips effortlessly into a distinctive narrative voice to capture Mike Daley's world and elevate the thriller story line to a deeper commentary on the state of the legal profession and the quest for true justice.

To its members, however, Opus Dei is a spiritual path, a way of incorporating the teachings of Jesus into everyday life. In <i>Ordinary Work, Extraordinary Grace</i>, Scott Hahn, a member of Opus Dei, describes the organization&#x2019;s founding, its mission, and its profound influence on his life. <br><br>Hahn recounts the invaluable part Opus Dei played in his conversion from Evangelical Christianity to Catholicism and explains why its teachings remain at the center of his life. Through stories about his job, his marriage, his role as a parent, and his community activities, Hahn shows how Opus Dei&#x2019;s spirituality enriches the meaning of daily tasks and transforms ordinary relationships. He offers inspiring insights for reconciling spiritual and material goals, discussing topics ranging from ambition, workaholism, friendship, and sex, to the place of prayer and sacrifice in Christianity today. <br><br>Engaging and enlightening, <i>Ordinary Work, Extraordinary Grace</i> is at once a moving personal story and an inspiring work of contemporary spirituality.</p><p><p>SCOTT HAHN is a professor of theology and Scripture at the Franciscan University of Steubenville and was recently appointed to the Pope Benedict XVI Chair of Biblical Theology and Liturgical Proclamation of Saint Vincent Seminary (Latrobe, Pennsylvania). He is the author of more than a dozen books, including <i>The Lamb&#x2019;s Supper</i>; <i>Hail, Holy Queen</i>; <i>Swear to God</i>; and <i>Understanding the Scriptures. </i>He lives in Steubenville, Ohio.</p>Chapter 1<br><br>A Personal Prelude<br>How I wish your bearing and conversation were such that, on seeing or hearing you, people would say: This man reads the life of Jesus Christ.<br><br>--THE WAY, NO. 2<br>I wasn't yet a Catholic wannabe. I was scared to be.<br><br>A Presbyterian minister, I had taken an extended sabbatical because I needed the time to study, pray, and ponder. Over the course of several years--and much against my deeply Calvinist and evangelical formation--I had been reading my way to a Catholic way of thinking. The more deeply I studied Scripture, theology, and history--and the more intensely I prayed--the more inexorably my mind was drawn to Catholicism.<br><br>Yet most of my experience of Catholic faith came from books. I had spent all of my post-teenage years in predominantly (and ardently) Protestant environments--first as a student at a small, private college, then at a renowned evangelical seminary, and then as pastor and teacher in some small denominational churches and schools. In all these places, I knew fond fellowship, inspiring leadership, and fervent worship.<br><br>On the other hand, my limited exposure to self-identified Catholics--outside of books--had been less than edifying. It came mostly in my teen years, and mostly from kids who were as delinquent as I had been before I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior.<br><br>Now I was an adult facing an adult crisis. I was a devout Protestant and an ordained minister who found the Catholic arguments more than persuasive--I found them compelling. So I was struggling to choose between all that I loved about my Protestant past and everything I was coming to understand about the Catholic faith. In the evangelicals I knew, I found a deep devotion to Jesus Christ . . . a humble ease in the ways of prayer . . . an astonishing work ethic . . . a zeal for Christianizing culture . . . and a passionate interest in the Scriptures. This last quality was supremely important to me as a preacher of the Word of God and a young biblical theologian. In Catholic doctrine, however, I found an overwhelming coherence, authenticity, and power.<br><br>The Bible had brought me to this crisis. At first I had wanted to understand the "covenant theology" of the first Protestant reformers. My research led me to discover that they, especially John Calvin and Martin Luther, were much more "Catholic" in their doctrine than were their modern descendants. Calvin and Luther led me to particular Scriptures--regarding sacraments, church hierarchy and authority, and even Marian doctrine--but just as importantly, they led me to the Church Fathers, those most ancient commentators on Scripture. And it was there, in the writings of the early fathers, that I ran smack up against a church I could only recognize as Catholic. It was liturgical, hierarchical, sacramental. It was Catholic, and yet it held all that I loved about the Reformation tradition too: a deep devotion to Jesus, a spontaneous life of prayer, a zeal to transform the culture, and, of course, a burning love for Scripture.<br><br>Still, that Church was real to me only in the dusty books I read. Where, I wanted to know, were the ordinary Catholic believers who lived this way?<br><br>Apparently, they were waiting for me in Milwaukee.<br><b><i>Common Ground</i></b><br><br>I arrived at Marquette University for graduate studies in theology with high hopes but low expectations. But soon I encountered grace upon grace. I met a kind and brilliant pastor who was willing to talk theology with me until the wee hours. He told me of his upbringing in a Polish-American home where family members customarily greeted one another with phrases from the Scriptures. But, I told myself, he was hardly an ordinary Catholic. He held a doctorate from a Roman university; he had served time as a Vatican official; and everyone whispered (rightly, it turns out) that he was on track to become a bishop.<br><br>Then I started to meet other Catholics--one a political philosopher, another a dentist--who showed the same qualities. The thing that most impressed me was that they both carried small Bibles in their pockets. At odd moments during the day, I might catch these men sitting in church reading the Scriptures. If I asked them to help me understand a point of doctrine, they would pull out the little book for backup. I thought to myself: <i>These are men who read the life of Jesus Christ--and read it for all it's worth.</i><br><br>I mentioned to my priest friend that I had met a couple of guys who always carried the New Testament with them and who really seemed to know it.<br><br>He replied, "Oh, they must be Opus Dei."<br><br><i>Opus Dei</i>: I knew enough Latin to know that it meant "the Work of God" or "God's Work." Almost immediately, when I heard Father's words, Opus Dei became for me a beacon--a lighthouse that promised the end of my long voyage, a first glimpse of a land I'd encountered only in books. It's not that the land was too small to be seen; nor was Opus Dei the whole of the land, for the Catholic Church is vaster than anything my denominational experience had prepared me for, and there were then (as there are now) so many other great institutions and movements in the Church. But for many reasons, Opus Dei was someplace where I could begin to feel at home.<br><br>What were those reasons?<br><br>� First and foremost was its members' apparent devotion to the Bible.<br><br>� Second was its warm ecumenism. Opus Dei was the first Catholic institution to welcome non-Catholics to cooperate in its apostolic labors.<br><br>� Third was how upright the lives of members were.<br><br>� Fourth was how ordinary their lives were. They were not theologians--they were dentists, engineers, journalists--but they were talking and living a theology I found attractive.<br><br>� Fifth, they espoused a holy ambition--a devout work ethic.<br><br>� Sixth, they practiced hospitality and gave their attention generously to my many questions.<br><br>� And seventh, they prayed. They made time for intimate prayer every day--true conversation with God. This gave them a serenity I had rarely encountered.<br><br>As I grew in my friendships with these men of Opus Dei, I came also to appreciate the rich biblical theology and biblical spirituality at the heart of their vocation. I took these as my own long before God gave me that same vocation--indeed, even before God brought me to the sacraments of the Catholic Church. I recognized immediately that they had tremendous potential for renewing my life, but also the life of Christ's Church, and the life of the world. This book is about Opus Dei's biblical theology and biblical spirituality.<br><b><i>Making Short Work of It</i></b><br> <br>My favorite definition of Opus Dei is the one I found on a prayer card back in the mid-1980s. Opus Dei is "a way of sanctification in daily work and in the fulfillment of the Christian's ordinary duties." It's not just a method of prayer, or an institution in the Church, or a theological school. It's "a way," and that way is wide enough to accommodate everyone whose days are filled with honest work--at home with the kids, in a factory or an office, in the mines, on the farm, or on the battlefield. The way is also wide enough to accommodate free and varied expressions of prayer and theological style and method. God calls some people to commit their lives to this way as the faithful of Opus Dei, but many others take spiritual guidance from Opus Dei and from the books of its founder.<br><br>Briefly put: Opus Dei was founded in 1928 by a young Spanish priest, St. Josemar�a Escriv� de Balaguer. For years before, he had received presentiments, indications in prayer, that God wanted something from him, but he had no idea what it would be. Then, rather suddenly one October day, as he was sitting down to read over some notes in his journal, he saw it. God showed St. Josemaria&#x2019;a what He wanted him to do.<br><br>The founder rarely spoke about what he "saw" at that moment, but he always used the verb "to see," and he made it clear that he saw Opus Dei in its entirety, as it would unfold through the years. As one Vatican document put it: "It was not a pastoral project which took shape slowly, but rather a call which suddenly burst into the soul of the young priest." What did he see? Perhaps his sketchy private notes give us a glimpse of the vision: "Ordinary Christians. A fermenting mass. Ours is the ordinary, with naturalness. The means: professional work. All saints!" When only three young men showed up for his first formal activities, he gave them benediction with the Blessed Sacrament: "When I blessed those three . . . I saw three hundred, three hundred thousand, thirty million, three billion . . . white, black, yellow, of all the colors, all the combinations that human love can produce."<br><br>St. Josemar�a saw that Jesus wants everyone to be a saint--everyone, without exception. Our Lord was speaking to the crowd, not to His inner circle, when He said, in the Sermon on the Mount: "Be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). <i>That</i> is the uncompromising Gospel, the good news that the apostles preached to the nations. St. Paul announced that God "chose us in Him, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and without blemish" (Ephesians 1:4). Moreover, God has made known His "plan" for us, "the mystery of His will." In the fullness of time--which is right now, today--we are "to restore all things in Christ" (Ephesians 1:10).<br><br>St. Josemar�a taught that all human activity--political life, family life, social life, labor and leisure--should be restored to Christ, offered to God as a pleasing sacrifice, united with the sacrifice of the cross, united with the sacrifice of the Mass. He longed for a day when "in every place in the world there will be Christians with a dedication that is personal and totally free--Christians who will be other Christs."<br><br>St. Josemar�a saw creation as a great cosmic liturgy, offered to the Father by those "other Christs" in union with Christ the high priest.<br><b><i>Priestly Soul, Lay Mentality</i></b><br><br>We can make this offering because we are a "royal priesthood, a holy nation" (1 Peter 2:9). We share in Christ's priesthood and kingship because, through baptism, we share in His nature (see 2 Peter 1:4). St. Josemaria&#x2019;a urged Christians to have a "truly priestly soul and a fully lay mentality." This is not a contradiction. For, as both priests and kings, we have a vocation that is both sacred and secular. We share in Christ's kingship; we share in His priesthood. So we sanctify the temporal order and offer it to God, restore it "in Christ" because we live in Christ. We restore it, a little bit at a time, beginning with the inch or the yard or the mile over which we've been given dominion. Our workspace, our living space--these are where we exercise our dominion and our priesthood. Our altar is our desktop, our workstation, the row we hoe, the ditch we dig, the diaper we change, the pot we stir, the bed we share with our spouse. All of it is sanctified by our offering hands, which are Christ's own.<br><br>This doctrine is a particular emphasis of Opus Dei, but it is the property of the whole Church. The kingship and the priesthood, the rights and the duties, belong not just to a privileged few, not just to the ordained clergy, but to all baptized believers. Our special dignity is that, in baptism, we have become "God's children" (1 John 3:2)--we have joined "the assembly of the firstborn" (Hebrews 12:23). And if we are the firstborn, then we are the heirs (see Galatians 4:7), inheritors of Christ's kingship and the priesthood--the secular (which we are sanctifying) and the sacred. "Everything belongs to you . . .," said St. Paul, "and you to Christ, and Christ to God" (1 Corinthians 3:22-23).<br><br>We are God's children. The theological term for this fact is "divine filiation"--and this is the foundation of Opus Dei. It is the source of freedom, confidence, purpose, ardor, and joy for all Christians who live and labor. It is the "open secret" that enables men and women the world over to live out their vocation: to sanctify their work, to sanctify themselves through their work, and to sanctify others through their work.<br><br>This is rich fare, I know. Again, we'll spend the rest of the book examining these doctrines in greater detail.<br><b><i>Form Fitting</i></b><br><br>St. Josemar�a spent the rest of his life preaching what God had revealed to him. At first he didn't even give it a name. His spiritual director suggested "Opus Dei," quite by accident, when one day he asked, "How is that work of God coming along?"<br><br>Gradually, the organizational details became clear to St. Josemar�a, though the Church's canon law could not yet accommodate the institution as God had revealed it. St. Josemar�a guided the development of the Work--cautiously, so that it never fell permanently into an inappropriate institutional form, even though it had to pass through a number of temporary, inadequate provisions. In 1965 the Second Vatican Council introduced the idea of a new form, a "personal prelature"--an institution having both lay and clergy members that could carry out specific apostolic tasks. The word personal means that the institution's leader, its prelate, has authority not over a territory (as an ordinary bishop does) but over a certain group or sort of persons, wherever those persons may be. In the case of Opus Dei, they are the "faithful" of the prelature--those who are called to make a permanent, personal dedication to this particular "way of sanctification." Whether married or celibate, they make their definitive commitment (which takes the form of a contract) when they make their "oblation," and they renew this commitment annually. At some point, they may recognize the permanence of their vocation more solemnly, by making "the fidelity"--essentially extending the term of the contract to the course of a lifetime.<br><br>St. Josemar�a recognized the personal prelature as the perfect form for Opus Dei. He did not, however, live to see his family arrive in its home. He died in 1975. In 1982 Pope John Paul II established Opus Dei as the Church's first personal prelature. As I set pen to paper, there are around 85,000 members--again, "faithful" is the Church's preferred term--in the prelature of Opus Dei. The vast majority of them are ordinary laypeople. A small number are priests.<br><b><i>Extra Ordinary</i></b><br><br>The stories of Opus Dei's founding could give the wrong impression, and perhaps that's why St. Josemaria&#x2019;a discussed them so infrequently. The founding of Opus Dei was the occasion of some documented miracles and extraordinary revelations. Yet the emphasis of Opus Dei is decidedly on <i>ordinary</i> life, <i>ordinary</i> work, and <i>ordinary</i> religious experience.<br><br>Perhaps the miracles were necessary because of the truly radical nature of God's plan for St. Josemaria&#x2019;a. It was a plan that seemed out of step with the times in the early twentieth century, a time when Catholic leaders emphasized the dignity of the clergy almost to the exclusion of the ordinary baptized believer. In Europe, as in the United States, the ordinary, universal, baptismal call to holiness was not an accepted theological opinion. St. Josemaria&#x2019;a himself faced accusations of heresy.</p><h2>Woman Running in the Mountains</h2><p>Pregnant and unmarried, Takiko, who lives at home with her violent, alcoholic father and her hard-working mother, discovers the true meaning of love, growing up, and maturity after she bears a son</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Japanese</p><h2>Les Aventures de Tintin, Le Sceptre D Ottokar - Tome 8 (French Edition)</h2><p>12 x 9 x 0.5 Inches The Adventures of Tintin (Les Aventures de Tintin) is a series of comic strips created by Belgian artist Herge the pen name of Georges Remi (1907 1983). The series first appeared in French in Le Petit Vingtieme, a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtieme Siecle on 10 January 1929. Set in a painstakingly researched world closely mirroring our own, Herge's Tintin series continues to be a favorite of readers and critics alike 80 years later.<br>The hero of the series is Tintin, a young Belgian reporter. He is aided in his adventures from the beginning by his faithful fox terrier dog Snowy (Milou in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy Captain Haddock, the bright but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (Professeur Tournesol) and other colorful supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (Dupond et Dupont). Herge himself features in several of the comics as a background character; as do his assistants in some instances.<br>The success of the series saw the serialized strips collected into a series of albums (24 in all), spun into a successful magazine and adapted for film and theatre. The series is one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century, with translations published in over 50 languages and more than 200 million copies of the books sold to date. <br>The comic strip series has long been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Herge's signature ligne claire style. Engaging, well-researched plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories within the Tintin series always feature slapstick humor, accompanied in later albums by sophisticated satire, and political and cultural commentary.</p><p>Herge, one of the most famous Belgians in the world, was a comics writer and artist. The internationally successful Adventures of Tintin are his most well-known and beloved works. They have been translated into 38 different languages and have inspired such legends as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. He wrote and illustrated for The Adventures of Tintin until his death in 1983.Text: French</p><h2>The Field of Swords (Emperor, Book 3)</h2><p><b>From the author of the bestselling <i>The Dangerous Book for Boys</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>With his acclaimed Emperor novels, author Conn Iggulden brings a dazzling world to life&#x2013;the rich, complex world of ancient Rome as seen through the eyes of one extraordinary man: Julius Caesar.

The setting sun splashed gold along a distant crest so that it seemed to hang in the air unsupported, a vein of light in the distance. Behind him, the murmur of conversation rose and fell without interrupting his thoughts. He could smell honeysuckle on the breeze and the touch of it in his nostrils made his own rank sweat even more pungent as the delicate fragrance shifted in the air and was gone.<br><br>It had been a long day. When he pressed a hand against his eyes, he could feel a surge of exhaustion rise in him like dark water. The voices in the campaign room mingled with the creak of chairs and the rustle of maps. How many hundreds of evenings had he spent on the upper floor of the fort with those men? The routine had become a comfort for them all at the end of a day, and even when there was nothing to discuss, they still gathered in the campaign rooms to drink and talk. It kept Rome alive in their minds and at times they could almost forget that they had not seen their home for more than four years.<br><br>At first, Julius had embraced the problems of the regions and hardly thought of Rome for months at a time. The days had flown as he rose and slept with the sun and the Tenth made towns in the wilderness. On the coast, Valentia had been transformed with lime and wood and paint until it was almost a new city veneered over the old. They had laid roads to chain the land and bridges that opened the wild hills to settlers. Julius had worked with a frenetic, twitching energy in those first years, using exhaustion like a drug to force away his memories. Then he would sleep and Cornelia would come to him. Those were the nights when he would leave his sweat-soaked bed and ride out to the watch posts, appearing out of the darkness unannounced until the Tenth were as nervous and tired as he was himself.<br><br>As if to mock his indifference, his engineers had found gold in two new seams, richer than any they had known before. The yellow metal had its own allure, and when Julius had seen the first haul spilled out of a cloth onto his desk, he had looked at it with hatred for what it represented. He had come to Spain with nothing, but the ground gave up its secrets and with the wealth came the tug of the old city and the life he had almost forgotten.<br><br>He sighed at the thought. Spain was such a treasure-house it would be difficult to leave her, but part of him knew he could not lose himself there for much longer. Life was too precious to be wasted, and too short.<br><br>The room was warm with the press of bodies. The maps of the new mines were stretched out on low tables, held by weights. Julius could hear Renius arguing with Brutus and the low cadence of Domitius chuckling. Only the giant Ciro was silent. Yet even those who spoke were marking time until Julius joined them. They were good men. Each one of them had stood with him against enemies and through grief, and there were times when Julius could imagine how it might have been to cross the world with them. They were men to walk a finer path than to be forgotten in Spain, and Julius could not bear the sympathy he saw in their eyes. He knew he deserved only contempt for having brought them to that place and buried himself in petty work.<br><br>If Cornelia had lived, he would have taken her with him to Spain. It would have been a new start, far away from the intrigues of the city. He bowed his head as the evening breeze touched his face. It was an old pain and there were whole days when he did not think of her. Then the guilt would surface and the dreams would be terrible, as if in punishment for the lapse.<br><br>"Julius? The guard is at the door for you," Brutus said, touching him on the shoulder. Julius nodded and turned back to the men in the room, his eyes seeking out the stranger amongst them.<br><br>The legionary looked nervous as he glanced around at the map-laden tables and the jugs of wine, clearly awed by the people within.<br><br>"Well?" Julius said.<br><br>The soldier swallowed as he met the dark eyes of his general. There was no kindness in that hard, fleshless face, and the young legionary stammered slightly.<br><br>"A young Spanish at the gate, General. He says he's the one we're looking for."<br><br>The conversations in the room died away and the guard wished he were anywhere else but under the scrutiny of those men.<br><br>"Have you checked him for weapons?" Julius said.<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"Then bring him to me. I want to speak to the man who has caused me so much trouble."<br><br>Julius stood waiting at the top of the stairs as the Spaniard was brought up. His clothes were too small for his gangling limbs, and the face was caught in the change between man and boy, though there was no softness in the bony jaw. As their eyes met, the Spaniard hesitated, stumbling.<br><br>"What's your name, boy?" Julius said as they came level.<br><br>"Adan," the Spaniard forced out.<br><br>"You killed my officer?" Julius said, with a sneer.<br><br>The young man froze, then nodded, his expression wavering between fear and determination. He could see the faces turned toward him in the room, and his courage seemed to desert him then at the thought of stepping into their midst. He might have held back if the guard hadn't shoved him across the threshold.<br><br>"Wait below," Julius told the legionary, suddenly irritated.<br><br>Adan refused to bow his head in the face of the hostile glares of the Romans, though he could not remember being more frightened in his life. As Julius closed the door behind him, he started silently, cursing his nervousness. Adan watched as the general sat down facing him, and a dull terror overwhelmed him. Should he keep his hands by his sides? All of a sudden, they seemed awkward and he considered folding them or clasping his fingers behind his back. The silence was painful as he waited and still they had their eyes on him. Adan swallowed with difficulty, determined not to show his fear.<br><br>"You knew enough to tell me your name. Can you understand me?" Julius asked.<br><br>Adan worked spit into his dry mouth. "I can," he said. At least his voice hadn't quavered like a boy's. He squared his shoulders slightly and glanced at the others, almost recoiling from the naked animosity from one of them, a bear of a man with one arm who seemed to be practically growling with anger.<br><br>"You told the guards you were the one we were looking for, the one who killed the soldier," Julius said.<br><br>Adan's gaze snapped back to him. "I did it. I killed him," he replied, the words coming in a rush.<br><br>"You tortured him," Julius added.<br><br>Adan swallowed again. He had imagined this scene as he walked over the dark fields to the fort, but he couldn't summon the defiance he had pictured. He felt as if he were confessing to his father, and it was all he could do not to shuffle his feet in shame, despite his intentions.<br><br>"He was trying to rape my mother. I took him into the woods. She tried to stop me, but I would not listen to her," Adan said stiffly, trying to remember the words he had practiced.<br><br>Someone in the room muttered an oath, but Adan could not tear his eyes away from the general. He felt an obscure relief that he had told them. Now they would kill him and his parents would be released.<br><br>Thinking of his mother was a mistake. Tears sprang from nowhere to rim his eyes and he blinked them back furiously. She would want him to be strong in front of these men.<br><br>Julius watched him. The young Spaniard was visibly trembling, and with reason. He had only to give the order and Adan would be taken out into the yard and executed in front of the assembled ranks. It would be the end of it, but a memory stayed his hand.<br><br>"Why have you given yourself up, Adan?"<br><br>"My family have been taken in for questioning, General. They are innocent. I am the one you want."<br><br>"You think your death will save them?"<br><br>Adan hesitated. How could he explain that only that thin hope had made him come?<br><br>"They have done nothing wrong."<br><br>Julius raised a hand to scratch his eyebrow, then rested his elbow on the arm of the chair as he thought.<br><br>"When I was younger than you, Adan, I stood in front of a Roman named Cornelius Sulla. He had murdered my uncle and broken everything I valued in the world. He told me I would go free if I put aside my wife and shamed her with her father. He cherished such little acts of spite."<br><br>For a moment, Julius looked into the unimaginable distance of the past, and Adan felt sweat break out on his forehead. Why was the man talking to him? He had already confessed; there was nothing else. Despite his fear, he felt interest kindle. The Romans seemed to bear only one face in Spain. To hear they had rivalry and enemies within their own ranks was a revelation.<br><br>"I hated that man, Adan," Julius continued. "If I had been given a weapon, I would have used it on him even though it meant my own life. I wonder if you understand that sort of hatred."<br><br>"You did not give up your wife?" Adan asked.<br><br>Julius blinked at the sudden question, then smiled bitterly. "No. I refused and he let me live. The floor at his feet was spattered with the blood of people he had killed and tortured, yet he let me live.

Yet brain scientists have uncovered details every business leader, parent, and teacher should know like the need for physical activity to get your brain working its best.<br><br>How do we learn? What exactly do sleep and stress do to our brains? Why is multi-tasking a myth? Why is it so easy to forget and so important to repeat new knowledge? Is it true that men and women have different brains?<br><br>In <i>Brain Rules</i>, Dr. John Medina, a molecular biologist, shares his lifelong interest in how the brain sciences might influence the way we teach our children and the way we work. In each chapter, he describes a brain rule what scientists know for sure about how our brains work and then offers transformative ideas for our daily lives.<br><br>Medina&#x2019;s fascinating stories and infectious sense of humor breathe life into brain science. You&#x2019;ll learn why Michael Jordan was no good at baseball. You&#x2019;ll peer over a surgeon&#x2019;s shoulder as he proves that most of us have a Jennifer Aniston neuron.

Medina is a developmental molecular biologist and research consultant. He is director of the Brain Center for Applied Learning Research at Seattle Pacific University. He also teaches at the University of Washington School of Medicine, in its Department of Bioengineering.Multitasking is the great buzz word in business today, but as developmental molecular biologist Medina tells readers in a chapter on attention, the brain can really only focus on one thing at a time. This alone is the best argument for not talking on your cellphone while driving. Medina (<i>The Genetic Inferno</i>) presents readers with a basket containing an even dozen good principles on how the brain works and how we can use them to our benefit at home and work. The author says our visual sense trumps all other senses, so pump up those PowerPoint presentations with graphics. The author says that we don't sleep to give our brain a rest&#x2014;studies show our neurons firing furiously away while the rest of the body is catching a few z's. While our brain indeed loses cells as we age, it compensates so that we continue to be able to learn well into our golden years. Many of these findings and minutiae will be familiar to science buffs, but the author employs an appealing style, with suggestions on how to apply his principles, which should engage all readers.

More recently, expensive &#x201c;Super Tuscans&#x201d; have been the rage. But between these extremes lay a bounty of delicious, moderately priced wines that belong in every wine drinker&#x2019;s repertoire.<br><br><b>Vino Italiano</b> is the only comprehensive and authoritative American guide to the wines of Italy.

After college, she sets off for Paris in pursuit of education and adventure, safe in the belief that Asa is devoted and waiting for her to come home, where they'll marry and live a simple American life. But just as she is beginning to lose herself to the beauty and mystery of her new city, she receives a letter from Asa that shatters her dreams for the future. Newly unanchored, she confronts the puzzle of her individual and cultural identity for the first time, a puzzle that is enhanced and complicated by the resurfacing of a childhood friend, Van Ardavanian. Van is an elusive and beguiling character, an intense, single-minded young man whose preoccupation with the Armenian heritage they share verges on the obsessive. He shows Ani a whole new way of looking at the world, turns her eyes to a tragic heritage she has shut out, and opens doors to parts of her identity that she has never before acknowledged. But Van cannot deliver her to herself any more than Asa could, and through him Ani learns that passion and idealism can have dark consequences.<br><br>Through a new constellation of friends and acquaintances in this foreign city, Ani comes to ask the questions about herself and the continuum she is a part of, and when Van disappears under dubious and mysterious circumstances, Ani returns home determined to puzzle out her past-- that of her father, David Silver, a Jew from NYC who was killed in a car accident when Ani was only five; that of David's family, who cut him and his new family off the moment he married Ani's Armenian mother; and finally, that of Ani's grandmother and grandfather whose gut-wrenching experiences during Armenian massacres at the hands of the Turks spill out once and for all, only at Ani's tentative prompting.<br><br>Having learned the hard way that she cannot use other people as conduits through which to find herself, Ani ultimately comes to demand access to the rooms of her past that have been denied her. Infused with warmth and humor, Dreams of Bread and Fire is an irresistible novel that addresses a question that has faced every generation in this country: whether it is possible to achieve the neat simplicity of American life once we've arrived here without denying the haunting legacies of the places we've fled from.</p><p><p><strong>Nancy Kricorian</strong>, author of the novels <em>Zabelle</em> and <em>Dreams of Bread and Fire,&nbsp;</em>is a widely published poet, essayist,&nbsp;and activist. After graduating from Dartmouth, Nancy studied and worked in Paris before earning an MFA&nbsp;in writing at Columbia University.</p>On a university fellowship in Paris, Ani Silver recovers from a failed love affair and comes to terms with her Armenian heritage in this fitfully lyrical but clumsily plotted novel. Just a few weeks into her stay in France, Ani is dumped by her self-involved trust-fund boyfriend in the U.S. Still hopelessly smitten, she finds it hard to forget him, even with the distraction of her semiotics classes at the Sorbonne and her duties as the au pair for a rich American couple and their daughter. Only a fortuitous encounter with her distant cousin Van Ardavanian, who grew up with her in the Armenian enclave of Watertown, Mass., rouses her from her depression. After they meet on Christmas Eve in Paris, they begin to see each other often. Van says he is working for an Armenian relief agency, but he disappears on odd errands. After a romantic trip to Corsica, Ani discovers that he is carrying a fake Cypriot passport and confronts him. His confession comes close to shaking her love for him, but also launches her into a study of the fate of the Armenians at the hands of the Turks. Her mother's parents fled Armenia during the genocide and now live in Watertown; her father's parents were devoutly Jewish and disowned their son after he married outside the faith. Back in the U.S., Ani sets out to learn all about both sides of her family, while worrying about Van, who disappeared just before she left Paris. Kricorian (Zabelle) can paint vivid tableaus, but she often strains for poetic effect, and Ani's self-conscious romantic musings vie awkwardly with the Armenian themes for top billing. All sorts of threads dangle at the novel's hasty conclusion, and readers will be left wishing Kricorian had focused her tale more tightly. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Men To Match My Mountains: The Opening of the Far West 1840-1900</h2><p>Stone has created a pageant of stories of the great westward drive.</p><p>Irving Stone was born in San Francisco on July 14, 1903.

What Marion Milner conveys so vividly and inspirationally is her lifelong intention to live as completely as possible in the moment. </p> <p>With a new introduction by Hugh Haughton, <em>Eternity&#x2019;s Sunrise</em> will be essential reading for all those interested in reflecting on the nature of their own happiness &#x2013; whether readers from a literary, an artistic, a historical, an educational or a psychoanalytic/psychotherapeutic background.</p></p><p><p><strong>Marion Milner</strong> (1900-1998) was a distinguished British psychoanalyst, educationalist, autobiographer and artist.</p><p>"<em>The book is the culmination of Milner&#x2019;s own literary journey, a final conjunction between her maverick take on psychoanalytic theory and her interest in art as it is created by or seen by people who are not &#x2018;artists&#x2019;, art historians or psycho-analysts. No-one can read the book, I think, without wondering about their own equivalent of Milner&#x2019;s glass bead game or what mysteries lie concealed in the memories and souvenirs we bring back from our trips away from home and visits to galleries, as from our dreams." </em>&#x2013; <strong>Hugh Haughton, from the new introduction. </strong></p></p><h2>English Skills Development</h2><p>Harris Communications BDVD179 Effective Interpreting - English Skills Development Study Set</p><p></p><h2>Folk Songs for Solo Singers: Medium Low (Paperback Book &amp; CD)</h2><p>Selected for contests and adjudications around the country, this incredible volume includes 11 favorite folk songs expertly crafted for solo voice and piano.

A clash between a scientist and an antinuclear demonstrator at a nuclear energy plant catalyzes an explosion that renders Nick Halloway, a securities analyst, invisible. Realizing that he will become a caged, scrutinized guinea pig if he surrenders to federal intelligence agents, Nick makes a run for his freedom. Saint has hit on a wonderful narrative device: insert one fantastic premise into the life of a Yuppie, but keep the rest of his world functional and, therefore, challenging. Nick displays the distinct sensibilities of a fugitive and a Wall Street smart guy as he invisibly fends for himself in the jungles he knows bestthe East Side of Manhattan and the trader's desk. Unerringly incorporating both humor and poignancy, with dialogue that rings absolutely true and suspense sustained at high pitch throughout, this supple fantasy attends so cleverly to plausible elements that it entertains from beginning to end. 100,000 first printing; $100,000 ad/promo; BOMC and QPBC main selections; film rights to Warner Brothers. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.When a scientific experiment goes awry, a securities analyst suddenly finds himself rendered invisible and wanted by the CIA for "medical study." To avoid becoming a laboratory animal, he goes on the lam, hiding in plain sight among the throngs of New York City, conducting his financial affairs by telephone, and eventually moving in with a woman who belives him to be a ghost.

There are no death defying rapids here, just great laid-back trips down easy-going streams, and fun whitewater on exciting but safe and sane rivers. All the runs can be done in an open canoe, but are also suitable for kayaks, inflatables and drift boats. The text is supplemented with exquisite photography and beautiful, easy-to-use maps.</p><p>Finally a book for the rest of us! There are plenty of books on Idaho rivers for advanced whitewater river runners, but this book, covering nearly 100 different river segments, is one that can be enjoyed by the whole family. <p>Katherine Daly and Ron Watters were the perfect team to do this book. Experienced river runners and outdoor writers, they put a lot of loving care into this book. The maps are works of art: accurate, understandable and usable on the river. To make the book easy-to-use, they supplemented the text with symbols which quickly encapsulate the river's difficulty, condition of access roads, surrounding terrain, and other features of the river. </p><p>Mileage charts are included which are invaluable for pinpointing location while running the river. And there's information on fishing, wildlife, seasons, water levels, boat ramps, scenic attractions and much more. All the rivers in this book can be done in an open canoe, but are also suitable for kayaks, inflatables, and drift boats.</p>My wife, Kathy, and I had a wonderful time putting this book together. When we had time off from our jobs, we would jump in the truck with our canoe tied on top, drive off and run rivers here and there throughout the state. (Boy, was that tough!) We put a lot of loving care into the preparation of the book, doing everything ourselves: writing, editing, book design, photography, cartography, and cover lay-out. I think you&#39;ll find it as inviting as the streams it covers with just the right amount of information for safe and unharried paddling on Idaho rivers.</p><h2>Official Nintendo Power The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Player&#39;s Guide</h2><p>The ONLY official guide from the insiders at Nintendo! <p><i>Unleash the beast!</i> </p><p>Don't let the creatures of the Twilight Realm drive you howling mad!

A farmer&#x2019;s nightmares are full of fire, from a carelessly tossed match, to a spark from a worn electrical wire, to a fluke bolt of lightening. Even the hay itself, if put up too damp and packed too tightly, can spontaneously ignite and bring about disaster. More than one farmer in Bobby&#x2019;s experience, Calvin Cutts included, wrapped up every day before bed by giving the barn a final fire check. To say that such vigilance smacked of paranoia was to miss the larger point: fire to a farmer was like a diagnosis of cancer&#x2015;survivable perhaps, but only following a long and crippled struggle, and only if you were lucky.</p> <p>Bobby had two choices: to investigate and perhaps stifle a problem before it got worse, or to run back to the house, raise the alarm, and get as many people and equipment coming as possible.</p> <p>Typically, sadly, and unsurprisingly, he yielded to a young man&#x2019;s faith in his own abilities, and set out to discover what was wrong.</p> <p>Bobby&#x2019;s sense of smell led him away from the bales and toward the sealed off, so-called fuel room that Calvin had built as far from any flammable materials as possible. Here was kept the gas and oil and diesel for their machines, locked behind a heavy, wooden door.</p> <p>He could hear more clearly now, as he approached that door, the hissing sound that had drawn his attention. But as he unhooked the key from a nearby post, and freed the fire extinguisher carefully placed beneath it, he remained convinced of his course of action. It was a closed room; whatever lay within it was contained and could thus be controlled.</p> <p>Which is when he heard a second sudden hissing, accompanied by a distinct snap&#x2015;behind him&#x2015;sharp, harsh, like the bite of a rat trap, far across the loft.</p> <p>He swung around, startled&#x2015;frightened. He&#x2019;d been wrong. The noise beyond the door wasn&#x2019;t all that he&#x2019;d heard earlier. And this second one, he realized with a sickening feeling, was accompanied by a flickering glow. A second fire had started near where he&#x2019;d just been.</p> <p>Bobby Cutts began to sweat.</p> <p>Distracted now, not thinking clearly, he clung to his initial plan of action. First things first. Ignoring the heat radiating from the lock as he slipped in the key, he twisted back the deadbolt, readied the fire extinguisher, and threw open the door.</p> <p>The resulting explosion lifted him off his feet and tossed him back like a discarded doll, landing him flat on the floor with a sickening thud to the back of his head. His mouth was bleeding copiously from where the extinguisher had broken several teeth as it flew from his hands.</p> <p>Dazed and spitting blood, a huge, curling fireball lapping at his feet, Bobby tried scrambling backwards, screaming in pain as he put weight on his shattered right hand. He rolled and crawled away as best he could, the smell of his own burned hair and skin strong in his nostrils. In the distance, at the loft&#x2019;s far end, he could see a second sheet of flame working its way up the face of the stacked hay bales.</p> <p>He got to his knees, staggered to his feet, and began stumbling back toward the ladder, his remaining instincts telling him to return below and free as many cows as possible before escaping himself.</p> <p>It wasn&#x2019;t easy. His eyes hurt and weren&#x2019;t focusing properly, he kept losing his balance from a brain hemorrhage he knew nothing about, and as he reached the top of the ladder, the injury to his hand returned like a hot poker. The only saving grace was that he could see anything at all, the hayloft being high-ceilinged enough that the red, glowing smoke stayed above him.</p> <p>He grabbed the ladder&#x2019;s upright with his good hand, fumbled for the first rung, and began his descent, hearing the tethered animals starting to get restless.</p> <p>Halfway down, just clear of the inferno overhead, he stopped for a moment to adjust to the stable&#x2019;s contrasting gloom. There, hanging by one hand, praying for salvation, he watched in stunned disbelief as all around him, one bright rope of fire, then two, then three, magically appeared on the walls from the ceiling and dropped like fiery snakes to the floor, shooting off in different directions and leaving lines of fire in their wakes, stimulating a loud, startled chorus of bellows from the frightened creatures below him.</p> <p>The fire spread as if shot from a wand, in defiance of logic or comprehension, racing from one hay pile to another. Bobby tried continuing down. But the cows had panicked in mere seconds, and were now, all sixty of them, struggling and stamping and heaving against their restraints, lowing and roaring as the encircling fire, progressing with supernatural speed, changed from a series of separate flames into the sheer embodiment of heat.</p> <p>One by one, the animals broke loose. Stampeding without direction, corralled by fire, they began generating a stench of burning flesh in the smoky, scream-filled vortex of swirling, lung-searing air. A broiling wind built up as it passed by the dying boy, the trapdoor directly above him now transformed into a chimney flue. Bobby Cutts clung to his ladder as to the mast of a sinking ship, weeping openly, the fire overhead filling the square opening with the blinding, blood-red heat of a falling sun.</p> <p>His hair smoking, all feeling gone from his burning body, he gazed between his feet into the twisting shroud of noise and flames and fog of char, no longer aware of the contorting bodies of the dying beasts slamming into his ladder, splintering it apart, and uncaring as he finally toppled into their midst, vanishing beneath a flurry of hooves.</p> (Archer Mayor)</p><h2>Peace</h2><p>Mesmerizing sci-fi from the author the Denver Post calls &#34;one of the literary giants of science fiction.&#34; The melancholy memoir of Alden Dennis Weer, an embittered old man living in a small midwestern town, reveals a miraculous dimension.

I try to use the candle as little as I can, but I lit it then and sat up with the blankets around me, enjoying the candlelight and listening to the sound of the dripping snow and to the icicles melting, and it seemed to me that the whole house was melting like the candle, going soft and running down into the lawn.This morning, when I looked out through the windows, I saw the tree. I took the cruiser ax and went out to it and chopped a few broken limbs finer still and put them on the fire, although it was no longer cold. Since my stroke I have been unable to use the big double-bitted Canadian ax, but at least twice a day I read it; "Buntings Best, 4 lb. 6 oz., Hickory Handle" has been burned into the wood. It was, in other words, branded, as thoughit were a steer; the three- or four- or five-hundredth time I read it, it finally came to me that this must be the origin of the phrase "brand new"--tools like my ax (and no doubt other things as well, more when more things were made of wood) were branded with the manufacturer's trademark after passing inspection, or by the inspector as a sign of approval. This would be the last manufacturing operation--they were then ready for sale and were "brand new." It seems a pity that I have only thought of all that now, when there is no one to tell it to, but that may be for the best; there are many questions of that kind, as I have observed, to which people would sooner not know the answers.While I was still living with my aunt Olivia, her husband bought her a Dresden figure of Napoleon for her mantel. (I suppose it is there yet--it may well be; I should find her room and see.) Visitors often wondered aloud why he kept one hand thrust into his waistcoat. As it happened, I knew the cause, having read it a year or so before--I believe in Ludwig's biography of him. At first I used to tell it in the hope of satisfying curiosity (and so obtaining those real though impalpable satisfactions, sweet at any time, but sweetest at thirteen, which accrue when we appear knowledgeable and thus, at least by implication, effective). Later I continued it as a psychological experiment, having observed that the innocent remark invariably offended.&nbsp;<br>My little fire is only smoldering now; but, dressed warmly as I am, this room is not uncomfortable. Outside the sky is leaden, and there is a breeze blowing. I have just taken a walk, and the weather feels ready for rain, though the ground is already so sodden by the melting snow. The half-warm wind is fit for spring, but I saw no other sign of it; the roses and all the trees still have hard, tight winter leaf buds; and, indeed, some of the roses still show (like mothers holding up their dead infants) the softly rotten shoots they put forth in the last warm weather of fall.Sometimes I walk as much as possible, and sometimes as little as I can, but the difference is not great. I do it to comfort myself.If I have decided that walking will bring death closer yet to my left side, I plan each errand with care; first to the woodpile (next to the china elephant whose howdah is a cushion for my feet), then to the fireplace, then to my chair again, before the fire. But if it seems to me that exercise is required, I deliberately include small side trips: first to the fire to warm my hands, then to the woodpile, then back to the fire, and sit down glowing with hygienic virtue. Neither of these regimes seems to improve my condition, and I change physicians regularly. There is this to be said for doctors: they may be consulted though dead, and I consult Doctors Black and Van Ness.I consult Dr. Black as a boy (though with a stroke), but Dr. Van Ness as a man.I stand straight and six feet tall, a fine figure of a man, though twenty (Dr. Van Ness will say thirty) pounds underweight. It is important, going to the doctor. Even in some mad way more important than a board meeting. As I dress in the morning, I remind myself that I will be undressing not, as usual, for bed, but in the doctor's office. It is a little like knowing I am going to be with a strange woman, and I shower after shaving and choose new shorts and undershirt and socks. At one-thirty I enter the Cassionsville and Kanakessee Valley Bank Building through bronze doors, more bronze doors to the elevator, and a glass door for the waiting room where five people sit listening to Glinka's <i>A Life for the Czar.</i> They are Margaret Lorn, Ted Singer, Abel Green, and Sherry Gold. And me. We are reading magazines, and the magazines are <i>Life, Look, Today's Health,</i> and <i>Water World.</i> Two of us are reading Life. Different issues, of course, and I am one of these readers, the other being Margaret Lorn. There is (as a matter of fact) a whole pile of <i>Lifes</i> before me, and I play the old game of trying to arrange them chronologically without looking at the dates, and lose. Margaret tosses down her copy and goes in to see the doctor, and I know, somehow, that this is a mark of contempt. I pick it up and find an area of the cover that is still warm (and slightly damp) from herhands. A nurse comes to the window and asks for Mrs. Price, and Sherry, who is sixteen now, tells her that she has already gone in, and the nurse looks aggrieved.Sherry turns to Ted Singer: "I have ..." Her voice sinks to a whisper. Ted says, "We've all got problems."I go to the nurse, a woman I do not know, a blond woman who might be Swedish. I say, "Please, I've got to see the doctor. I'm dying."The nurse: "All these people are ahead of you."Ted Singer and Sherry Gold are both obviously much younger than I, but there is no use arguing with that kind of thing. I sit down again, and the nurse calls my name--into a cubicle to undress.Dr. Van Ness is slightly younger than I, very competent-looking in that false way of medical men on television dramas. He asks what seems to be the matter, and I explain that I am living at a time when he and all the rest are dead, and that I have had a stroke and need his help."How old are you, Mr. Weer?"I tell him. (My best guess.)His mouth makes a tiny noise, and he opens the file folder he carries and tells me my birthday. It is in May, and there is a party, ostensibly for me, in the garden. I am five. The garden is the side yard, behind the big hedge. It is a large yard, I suppose, even for adults, big enough for badminton or croquet, though not for both at once; for five it is enormous. Children come in boxy, tottering cars, as though they were toys being delivered in little trucks, the girls in pink lace dresses, the boys in white shirts and navy shorts. One boy has a cap, which we throw into the blackberries.Today it is spring, a season that in the Midwest may last less than a week, leaving the jonquils to droop in the heat before they are well opened--but this is spring, true spring, the wind whipping the first dandelions for their birthday, once for this year, once for last, ten to grow on, and a pinch for an inch.Mothers' dresses are a hand's-breadth above their ankles, often of sensible colors; they like wide-brimmed, low-crowned hats, and jet beads. Their skirts flutter and they laugh, bending to gather them, holding the hats with one hand when the brims flap, the wind rattling their beads like the curtains in a Tunisian brothel.In the wind-shadow of the garage, on the smoothly mown lawn, there is lemonade for them and a pink-frosted pink cake whose five candles blown at a breath grant every wish. Violet-eyed and black-haired, my aunt Olivia takes ice water in a large goblet instead, swirling it in her hand as though she were warming brandy; Cassionsville water from the Kanakessee River, around and down, lonely for its catfish. There is a white Pekinese as big as a spaniel at her feet, and it snarls when anyone comes too near. (Laugh, ladies, but Ming-Sno will bite.)Mrs. Black and Miss Bold, sisters, sit side by side. They have --together, as though they were the goddesses of nations joined to blast the fields of that foreign power, myself--brought Bobby Black. Barbara Black has chestnut hair, regular features, and long soft lashes; since bearing her child she has--so my grandmother, whose ghost vaguely, pinkly, haunts my party, says--"put on twenty pounds of healthy flesh"; but it has not heightened her color, which remains that soft and only delicately pink-tinted hue which is the heritage of all the Bolds. Her sister is radiantly blond, slender and flexible as a willow--too much so for the other women, for to them a physical pliancy implies moral accommodation, and they suspect Eleanor Bold (assigning her, in their own minds and in sewing-circle, sugar-lending, Methodist-social conversations, the most improbable of lovers: farmhands and railroad firemen, the rumored sons of departed ministers, the sheriff's silent deputy).This high, white house was my grandmother's and since our mothers on the lawn can see what we do there, we are--largely--in it, clattering up and down the steep and narrow and carpetless stair leading from the second floor to the third that we may starein giggling silence there at the huge picture of my father's dead brother, which leans, unhung, against the wall of the farthest, coolest room.It was, as I know from some occult source that, beneath the sleepless and probing lenses of the Cassionsville Spiritualist Society now so recently organized by my aunt Arabella, might be found to be Hannah (once my grandmother's cook and now my mother's)--it was, I say, painted almost precisely a year before his death. He appears to be about four, a sad-eyed, dark-haired child standing willingly but without joy to have his portrait done. He wears loose red trousers like a zouave, a white silk shirt, and a black velvet vest, and he smells of apples, from having been stored so long with them, and of quilts (hand-stitched with incredible fineness so that each in its own fabric of being stood a soft, warm monument to the endless labor of Tuesday and Thursday afternoons--just as so many did, in their designs, to the genius of William Morris); and afterward, when I had not seen my father's dead brother--whom he himself had never seen--for years, I came to imagine that he stood wrapped in a quilt (just as I, as a child, had been made to wrap myself in a large towel after a bath) with apples rolling at his feet. I went, I think at about the age of twenty, up into that house again and disabused myself of the notion, and at the same time recognized--with a start of surprise that might almost have been shame--that the dreaming landscape before which he stood as though upon a windowsill, a region I had always associated with the fairy tales of Andrew Lang (particularly those of the <i>Green Fairy Book</i>) and George MacDonald, was in fact a Tuscan garden.That garden, with its marble faun and fountain, its Lombardy poplars and its beeches, has impressed my mind always far more strongly than poor dead Joe, whom none of us except my grandmother and Hannah had ever seen, and whose little grave in the cemetery on the hill was tended mostly by the ants that had built a city upon his chest. Now, when I sit alone before myfire and look out at the wreck of the elm revealed by the lightning flashes, confused and ruinous as a ship gone aground, it seems to me that the garden--I mean little Joe's garden, basking forever in the sunshine of its Tyrrhenian afternoon--is the core and root of the real world, to which all this America is only a miniature in a locket in a forgotten drawer; and this thought reminds me (and is reinforced by the memory) of Dante's <i>Paradiso,</i> in which (because the wisdom of this world was the folly of the next) the earth stood physically central, surrounded by the limbus of the moon and all the other spheres, greater and greater, and at last by God, but in which this physical reality was, in the end, delusive, God standing central in spiritual truth, and our poor earth cast out--peripheral to the concerns of Heaven save when the memory of it waked, with something not unlike an impure nostalgia, the great saints and the Christ from the contemplation of triune God.True; all true. Why do we love this forlorn land at the edge of everywhere?Sitting before my little fire, I know, when the wind blows outside, moaning in the fieldstone chimney I caused to be built for ornament, shrieking in the gutters and the ironwork and the eaves and trim and trellises of the house, that this planet of America, turning round upon itself, stands only at the outside, only at the periphery, only at the edges, of an infinite galaxy, dizzily circling. And that the stars that seem to ride our winds cause them. Sometimes I think to see huge faces bending between those stars to look through my two windows, faces golden and tenuous, touched with pity and wonder; and then I rise from my chair and limp to the flimsy door, and there is nothing; and then I take up the cruiser ax (Buntings Best, 2 lb. head, Hickory Handle) that stands beside the door and go out, and the wind sings and the trees lash themselves like flagellants and the stars show themselves between bars of racing cloud, but the sky between them is empty and blank.Not so the Tuscan sky: it is of an untroubled blue, once ortwice touched with thin white clouds that cast no shadows on the ground below. The fountain is sparkling in the sun, but Joe does not hear it, nor will it ever damp his clothes or even the flagstones about its own basin. Joe holds a tiny gun with a tin barrel, and a stiff-legged wooden dog, but Bobby Black is coming and will, if he gains this room, throw apples that, striking the walls, will break, spattering picture and floor with crisp, fragrant, tart fragments; and these in turn, eventually, become brown, dirty, and sour, and will be discovered (most probably by Hannah) and I blamed, for it is impossible, unthinkable, that I should clean the floor, like asking a pig to fly or a mouse to play on the mouth-organ--we pigs, we mice, we children do not do such things, our limbs would not obey us. I stand at the top of the stair, inferior in strength and size but superior in position, silent, my eyes nearly closed, my face contorted, ready to cry, and I defy him; he jeers at me, knowing that if he can make me speak his battle is won; the others look over my shoulders and between my legs--my audience, not my allies.At last we close, grunting, each grasping the other's pudgy body like wrestlers, red-faced and weeping. For a moment we sway.&nbsp;<br>Outside my aunt Olivia has lit a cigarette in a mammoth-ivory holder (tooth-of-the-devil) as long as her forearm. Mrs. Singer says, looking not at her but at my mother, "Have you the skin?" and my mother: "Yes, it's in on the piano; I'll have Hannah bring it when she comes out again," and Mrs. Green, who is somehow--I am too young to know--something of a slavey to my mother because we own her husband's farm: "I'll get it, Princess White Fawn," and my mother: "Fly swiftly, Princess Little Bird," and everyo...</p><h2>The Wall Chart of World History: From Earliest Times to the Present, Facsimile Edition</h2><p>Six millennia of world history at a glance, in more than 400 illustrations.Through thousands of dates, facts and quotes, all in chronological sequence, a 30-foot, visual panorama of history literally unfolds, revealing untold treasures inside.

Though he achieved fame in his lifetime as much for his scriptwriting and radio shows as his cartooning, he is now considered one of the early pioneers of the graphic novel format.<i>Starred Review.</i> With a unique blend of high-velocity drawing and unabashed love of language, Gross remains one of the great cartoonists of the 20th century. One of his masterpieces was the innovative 1930 wordless graphic novel, <i>He Done Her Wrong</i>. Conceived in response to the wave of wordless picture story books such as Lynd Ward's <i>God's Man</i>, Gross blended elements from dime novels, the high drama of Ward's work and, of course, his own background in the Yiddish humor tradition to create a lengthy work of cartoon genius. It follows a typical story arc: lumberjack hero and dainty damsel fall in love until the slightly dim hero is tricked by the rascally villain, who succeeds in separating the lovers for much of the book. Eventually, the hero and his love are reunited and the villain defeated, but Gross takes the action from woods to city to cliffs and mansions and back again, never forgetting to make the whole thing extremely funny and suspenseful. Fantagraphics has produced a perfect facsimile edition of the original book, complete with an excellent essay by Paul Karasik. <i>He Done Her Wrong </i>should be on every graphic novel devotee's shelf and is, in fact, as Gross's original subtitle cheekily suggests, an honest-to-goodness great American novel. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They see a dragon cover, they expect high dragon fantasy - they find a squirrel rescue drama &amp; strange clay figurines (of dragons) instead. If you think that's not for you (try reading the reviews), please jump to the next book, ICEFIRE, or the third in the series, FIRE STAR, where you'll get all the dragon myth you want. This book is called THE FIRE WITHIN for a very specific reason: it's about the joy of writing stories and the power of discovering your creativity, which I believe is important to every child you reads a book. It attempts to answer the question: where does inspiration come from? and uses a dragon as a means to an end. It's gentle, slightly twee in places, and not everyone's 'cup of tea' as we'd say in the UK. But it kicked this writer off on an intuitive journey of exploration which has evolved into a major fantasy series, and I would like to think that young people who read it might be similarly inspired. So thank you to all the hundreds of people who have written and told me how much they love it: read on &amp; have fun! Adults and avid fantasy buffs: please read it for what it is, not for what you hope it will be.

Garrard traveled into the wild and free Rocky Mountain West and left us this fresh and vigorous account, which, says A. B. Guthrie, Jr., contains in its pages "the genuine article-the Indian, the trader, the mountain man, their dress, and behavior and speech and the country and climate they lived in."</p><p>On September 1, 1846, Garrard, then only seventeen years old, left Westport Landing (now Kansas City) with a caravan under the command of the famous trader C�ran St. Vrain, bound for Bent's Fort (Fort William) in the southeastern part of present-day Colorado. After a lengthy visit at the fort and in a camp of the Cheyenne Indians, early in 1847 he joined the little band of volunteers recruited by William Bent to avenge the death of his brother, Governor Charles Bent of Taos, killed in a bloody but brief Mexican and Indian uprising in that New Mexican pueblo. In fact, Garrard's is the only eyewitness account we have of the trial and hanging of the "revolutionaries" at Taos.</p><p>Many notable figures of the plains and mountains dot his pages: traders St. Vrain and the Bents; mountain men John L. Hatcher, Jim Beckwourth, Lucien B. Maxwell, Kit Carson, and others; various soldiery traveling to and from the outposts of the Mexican War; and explorer and writer George F. Ruxton.</p></p><p><p><strong>Hector Lewis Garrard</strong> (alias Lewis H. Garrard) returned in the summer of 1847 to his home in Cincinnati, where he studied medicine and perhaps law.

Amy S. Greenberg&#x2019;s skilled storytelling and rigorous scholarship bring this American war for empire to life with memorable characters, plotlines, and legacies.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br> When President James K. Polk compelled a divided Congress to support his war with Mexico, it was the first time that the young American nation would engage another republic in battle. Caught up in the conflict and the political furor surrounding it were Abraham Lincoln, then a new congressman; Polk, the dour president committed to territorial expansion at any cost; and Henry Clay, the aging statesman whose presidential hopes had been frustrated once again, but who still harbored influence and had one last great speech up his sleeve. Beyond these illustrious figures, <i>A Wicked War</i> follows several fascinating and long-neglected characters: Lincoln&#x2019;s archrival John Hardin, whose death opened the door to Lincoln&#x2019;s rise; Nicholas Trist, gentleman diplomat and secret negotiator, who broke with his president to negotiate a fair peace; and Polk&#x2019;s wife, Sarah, whose shrewd politicking was crucial in the Oval Office.<br><br> This definitive history of the 1846 conflict paints an intimate portrait of the major players and their world. It is a story of Indian fights, Manifest Destiny, secret military maneuvers, gunshot wounds, and political spin. Along the way it captures a young Lincoln mismatching his clothes, the lasting influence of the Founding Fathers, the birth of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and America&#x2019;s first national antiwar movement. A key chapter in the creation of the United States, it is the story of a burgeoning nation and an unforgettable conflict that has shaped American history.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p></p><p>Amy S.

She is a leading scholar of Manifest Destiny and has held fellowships from the Huntington Library, the New-York Historical Society, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the American Philosophical Society.

It was Valentine&#x2019;s Day, no longer a sleepy saint&#x2019;s day resigned to religious calendars, but fast becoming a national craze. Stationers had discovered profit in the increasingly sentimental culture of middle-class America by promoting a holiday dedicated to the novel practice of exchanging store-bought cards. Christmas presents were still considered suspect, even profane, by American Protestants in the 1840s, but among the urbane it had become a &#x201c;national whim&#x201d; to send engraved or printed tokens of love through the mail, more than thirty thousand in 1844 in New York City alone. Urban post offices around the country were &#x201c;piled with mountains of little missives, perfumed, gilt, enameled, and folded with rare cunning . . . they overflow with the choicest flowers of love, poetry and sentiment.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most everything fashionable in 1840s America was imported from Europe, and this whim was no exception. Initially, almost all Valentine&#x2019;s Day cards were British-made. But perennially insecure Americans complained that the old empire was &#x201c;defrauding&#x201d; Uncle Sam &#x201c;of a rightful increase in his revenue.&#x201d; U.S. firms rose to the challenge: they began producing and marketing their own sentimental cards, and advertising them in newspapers. Countless shops sold these valentines in towns and cities, and peddlers brought them into rural areas. Within just a few short years American-made valentines had become ubiquitous. Nothing better demonstrated the increasing complexity and sophistication of American commerce in the 1840s, or the rise of a female-centered culture of romance and sentimentality, than did the wholesale American embrace of a commercialized Valentine&#x2019;s Day. In 1844 it was being celebrated like never before. It had, according to some observers, achieved &#x201c;epidemic&#x201d; proportions.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valentine&#x2019;s Day could have been made for Henry Clay. During his nearly forty years in national politics, he had been both lauded and condemned for his attention, attachment, and deference to the ladies, so much so that the number of women he had kissed had become a running joke in Washington. The trappings of organized religion left him cold, but he was renowned for his sentimentality and deep emotion. He was easily moved to tears, and when Clay wept while delivering a speech in Congress, listeners on both sides of the aisle found themselves similarly moved. As the founder of the preeminent Whig Party, a political organization devoted to the growth of American business, Henry Clay was the public face of American commerce. It was Whig legislation, conceptualized by Clay, that enabled American card producers to compete with British imports, and that financed the roads and bridges over which the thousands of valentines traveled.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early 1844 he could lay claim to being the &#x201c;most popular man in America.&#x201d; &#x201c;Prince Hal,&#x201d; as his supporters warmly called him, was the nation&#x2019;s most distinguished statesman, renowned for his oratory, his brilliant legal mind, his legislative prowess, and for his decades of service to the nation. He led the charge to war against Britain in 1812 and helped negotiate the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the conflict in 1815. His Missouri Compromise of 1820 calmed a sectional firestorm by maintaining the balance of slave and free states while also limiting the future spread of slavery to south of the Mason-Dixon line. As secretary of state under John Quincy Adams in the 1820s, he was an avid supporter of hemispheric solidarity, embracing the newly independent nations of Latin America as republican kin to the United States. And he promoted a vision for the economic development of the nation, what came to be known as his &#x201c;American System,&#x201d; that proved so compelling it became the platform for a new political party.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His personality was as dazzling as his r�sum�. There was no better conversationalist in Washington, no more charming man to meet at a party, no one more ingratiating when he wanted to be&#x2014;which was always. He was a master at the fiddle and a brilliant teller of jokes. He never ceased to remind his listeners that he came from humble origins (Clay was the first national politician to refer to himself as a self-made man). But by the time he entered politics he carried himself, and behaved, exactly like what he was: a southern gentleman who loved parties, gambling, whiskey, and women, who was open in his affections and undeniably magnetic. His wife, Lucretia, conveniently remained home in Kentucky, where she faultlessly managed their large family and equally impressive estate, Ashland.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His excesses were in the past, youthful indiscretions that only his enemies would deign to dredge up. Now he was a mature politician, his appeal nationwide. He was the &#x201c;Sage of Ashland.&#x201d; Although he carried himself like a southerner, his vision of an American economy based on production was warmly embraced in the North. Despite owning scores of slaves, he professed to hate slavery.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clay&#x2019;s popularity was in no way the product of his outward appearance. His self-assurance frequently crossed into arrogance, but even Clay would admit that nature had not blessed him with beauty. The freckles, blue eyes, and white-blond hair of his youth alone would have placed him outside the era&#x2019;s manly ideal, but far worse were his facial features: a cavernous mouth rimmed with thin lips, and a receding cleft chin that emphasized his very prominent nose.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Clay made the best of what he had. Tall and thin, with delicate hands, he was graceful in his demeanor and careful in his dress. The real draw was his sparkling wit and great desire to please. &#x201c;No portrait ever did him justice&#x201d;; neither painting nor daguerreotype could capture his easy and winning smile or his ability to connect almost instantly with a new acquaintance. &#x201c;His appearance upon the whole was not at first prepossessing,&#x201d; one visitor to his house noted, &#x201c;but when you heard him converse, you felt you were under the influence of a great and good man.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His popularity among women was legendary. They flocked around him when he appeared in public, treasured mementos of his visits, and purchased reproductions of his likeness. They cheered his elections and promoted his causes. It was generally acknowledged that &#x201c;if the Ladies . . . could vote, the election of Mr. Clay would be carried by acclamation!&#x201d; They continued to find him irresistible well into his middle age, when his receding hairline did nothing to diminish his remarkable wit and courtesy. As his closest female friend, Alabama socialite Octavia LeVert, explained, Clay had &#x201c;a heroism of heart, a chivalry of deportment, a deference of demeanor,&#x201d; all of which were &#x201c;irresistible talismans over the mind of the gentler sex.&#x201d; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor were women alone in succumbing to Clay&#x2019;s charms. There was a &#x201c;winning fascination in his manners that will suffer none to be his enemies who associate with him,&#x201d; wrote one congressman. &#x201c;When I look upon his manly and bold countenance, and meet his frank and eloquent eye, I feel an emotion little short of enthusiasm in his cause.&#x201d; Clay easily disarmed wary strangers; even lifelong opponents of his legislation found the legislator difficult to dislike in person. His political antagonist, South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun, believed Clay was &#x201c;a bad man, an imposter, a creator of wicked schemes.&#x201d; But after decades of political battles between the two, Calhoun concluded, &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t speak to him, but, by God! I love him.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry Clay was an American original, glamorous and magnetic to a fault, but far from perfect. He was spoiled by a lifetime of acclaim (he first entered the Senate at the tender and unconstitutional age of twenty-nine), and even his friends admitted he could be a prima donna. His wit could be biting, and he was easily bored. Impulsive and ardent, he too often spoke before thinking, made promises he couldn&#x2019;t keep, and later came to regret his decisions. His ambivalence about slavery led many voters on both sides of the question to discount him as opportunistic. As a young man he passionately argued that Kentucky should end slavery through a plan of gradual emancipation similar to those being adopted by the mid-Atlantic states. When that plan was rejected he devoted himself to the cause of colonization, believing it possible to end slavery by colonizing freed slaves in Africa. But forty years later his wealth derived in large part from the unpaid labor of fifty men, women, and children whom he owned. His enemies called him a demagogue, but not to his face. Like other southern gentleman, Clay kept a set of dueling pistols and had put them to use more than once. But these excesses were also in the past, the dueling pistols now just for show.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>By all measures February 14, 1844, should have been a blissful Valentine&#x2019;s Day for Henry Clay, &#x201c;full of glorious recollections&#x2014;and pregnant with never ending happiness,&#x201d; as it was for so many others. But this was not to be. In place of a scented, embossed, cherub-decorated paper heart, Henry Clay received intelligence that day that put a damper on his hopes and shook him to the bone.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clay was near the end of a two-month stay in his favorite city, New Orleans, when the local paper broke the news. He was lodging in the elegant and urbane home of Dr. William Mercer, on Carondelet Street, close to the hotels and business establishments where he spent his days winning over the wealthy men of the city with his brilliant economic plans, and evenings flattering their wives and sisters. The fun ended when he picked up the paper on February 14. Clay was flabbergasted, unwilling to believe the news, but also afraid it was true: reportedly President John Tyler had secretly negotiated a treaty to annex the Republic of Texas and was at that very moment lining up supporters for the bill in the Senate. Surely the great Henry Clay, who until two years before had been the senior senator from Kentucky and who was currently preparing for his third presidential run, should have known about a matter of such monumental importance both to the nation and to his status as a power broker in Washington. How could he be so out of the loop? &#x201c;Address me instantly,&#x201d; he demanded of his friend and Senate successor, John Crittenden. &#x201c;If it be true, I shall regret extremely that I have had no hint of it.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True it was. In the winter of 1843&#x2013;44, Secretary of State Abel P. Upshur had nearly drafted a treaty with the Lone Star Republic and had employed his masterly lobbying abilities to persuade a majority of U.S. senators to secretly pledge their support for it. By late January Upshur felt confident enough of the passage of the treaty to assure Texas leaders that forty of America&#x2019;s fifty-two senators were committed to Texas&#x2019;s annexation. With two-thirds of the Senate lined up, annexation was all but ensured.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a startling turn of events, both for Henry Clay and for the nation. Clay&#x2019;s insider status was legendary. America&#x2019;s first congressional power broker, Clay became the Speaker of the House of Representatives on his first day as a congressman in 1811, and made the speakership second only to the presidency in its power. As Speaker, Clay offered patronage, controlled legislation and desirable committee appointments, and even decided who became president in the contested election of 1824, favoring Adams over Andrew Jackson despite the fact that Old Hickory had received more electoral and popular votes. The following decades became known as the Age of Jackson, but they could just as surely be called the Age of Clay, for Clay was as much a force of nature in American politics as his archfoe. The difference, of course, was that Andrew Jackson had won two presidential elections, while Henry Clay had twice lost.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1844 Henry Clay was consumed with the notion that his time, at long last, had come. Dozens of important men had accrued debts to him over his many years in office, and Clay was ready to call in those debts in order to accede to the nation&#x2019;s highest office. Clay hadn&#x2019;t been officially nominated yet; the convention wasn&#x2019;t until May. But New Orleans was the launching pad for a lengthy tour of the Southeast designed to shore up his support in the region, and so far things had gone swimmingly. In public squares and in private drawing rooms, the good people of New Orleans proclaimed Henry Clay their undisputed choice for president. Nothing appeared to stand in his way&#x2014;until he heard the news about Texas on Valentine&#x2019;s Day.<br>Texas had been brewing as a problem since 1835, when a band of slave-owning American settlers, attracted by Mexico&#x2019;s generous immigration policies and the ample land available for growing cotton, rose in rebellion in the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians (as they called themselves) invoked the American Revolution to justify their actions, but their objections to Mexican rule extended beyond representation, taxes, and trade. In 1830 Mexico attempted to restrict immigration into Texas and to limit slaveholding. The laws were utterly unenforceable, and probably just as many in the region were as upset about Mexico&#x2019;s attempt to collect revenue and increase central authority as they were about the fate of their slaves. But the survival of the &#x201c;peculiar institution&#x201d; made for a perfect call to arms. The nation was, in the words of a Texas newspaper, attempting to &#x201c;give liberty to our slaves, and to make slaves of ourselves.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Americans viewed the Texas Revolution not as a war for slavery but as a race war between brown Mexicans and white Texians, and as a result supported the Texians wholeheartedly. Thousands of white American men from the South and West illegally crossed into Texas in order to join the fight against Mexico. Many fewer, primarily ministers and abolitionists, attacked the legitimacy of the rebellion. In Philadelphia, Quaker abolitionist Benjamin Lundy left no doubts about his views on the subject when he titled his 1836 pamphlet <i>The War in Texas; A Review of Facts and Circumstances, Showing That This Contest Is a Crusade Against Mexico, Set on Foot and Supported by Slaveholders, Land Speculators, &amp;c, in Order to Re-establish, Extend, and Perpetuate the System of Slavery and the Slave Trade.</i> A second edition expanded on his arguments against &#x201c;the grand deception&#x201d; calling itself Texas independence. But outside New England, where a significant minority supported the abolition of slavery, few Americans believed that Mexicans occupied the moral high ground in this conflict. Not even Quaker Pennsylvania was a safe place to protest the Texas Revolution: a Philadelphia mob destroyed Lundy&#x2019;s printing press and threatened his life a year after the second edition of <i>The War in Texas</i> appeared in print.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marked by dramatic battles, the Texas Revolution was ripe for exploitation in America&#x2019;s vibrant and competitive penny press. There was no need to exaggerate or sensationalize. Mexican troops, driven by the battle cry &#x201c;Exterminate to the Sabine&#x201d; river, acted barbarously. First came the cruel slaughter of American Texians by Mexican general Antonio L�pez de Santa Anna at the Alamo. Mexican forces piled up Texian corpses, soaked them in oil, and set them on fire. At Goliad, although his subordinate agreed to treat surrendering forces as prisoners of war, Santa Anna arbitrarily set aside the agreement, marched 340 Texians out of town, and had them all shot.</p><h2>Remember When</h2><p>Judith McNaught&#39;s last enchanting bestseller, Until You, was hailed as &#34;brilliantly done and completely entertaining... ripe plot twists... a fine supporting cast&#34; (Ocala Star-Banner).

Diana Foster!It was the perfect to their respective dilemmas, and, after a lot of champagne for Diana and some skilled persuasion from Cole, their lips met in a long, slow, bargain-sealing kiss.

It was surrounded by a low, white fence and brightly lit now by huge, new mercury-vapor lights on high poles that shone almost as bright as daylight on the ring and simultaneously cast everything else into shadow. <p> From her vantage point just outside the stable, Diana watched Spence dismount and begin leading the handsome sorrel around the ring to cool him down. He said something to Corey that made her laugh as she walked along beside him, and Diana smiled with pleasure that Corey's evening was turning out so well. </p><p> Instead of having to share him with Doug and Barb Hayward and Doug's father plus one of Spence's innumerable and inevitable girlfriends, as Corey and Diana had expected, Corey had him entirely to herself. The Haywards had at the last minute remembered a relative's birthday party and were attending that, and Spence was by himself. </p><p> Diana's evening hadn't turned out badly, either. She'd had Cole entirely to herself. Managing to see him as often as she could without having it seem contrived had been the second hardest thing she'd ever done-second only to keeping her feelings for him a complete secret from him and everyone else. </p><p> Nearly all of Barb's friends had wild crushes on him. He was tall, tanned, wide-shouldered, and narrow-hipped. In snug, soft jeans and a short-sleeved shirt, every inch of his muscled body exuded power and raw sex appeal. His complete lack of social standing, his lack of money, and his lowly job at the stable made him off-limits to them. Which made him infinitely more attractive. </p><p> He refused to talk about himself to them, which made him mysterious and all the more fascinating. </p><p> He was unattainable, which made him even more desirable. </p><p> He was immune to their looks, their money, and their ploys. And that made him a challenge. </p><p> Since Cole couldn't be coerced or tricked into talking about himself, they spent endless hours speculating about his family and his friends back home and inventing dire experiences that might have made him want to forget or bury his past. </p><p> They did everything to get his attention, from trying to flirt with him, to wearing their tightest pants and most revealing tops, to asking him to examine nonexistent ankle sprains and hurt wrists, to pretending to fall against him when they dismounted. </p><p> One by one, Diana had watched Cole's reactions to each girl's attempt to flirt with him, and she soon realized that the more blatant the attempt was, the stronger his retaliation. Milder transgressors were treated like children, subjected to his open amusement and spoken to in a condescendingly superior way that made the transgressor squirm. More daring transgressors received a much more unbearable punishment: they were subjected to weeks of cool and distant behavior. Unfortunately, both of his tactics made it necessary to find ways to get back into his good graces, which made him seem even more powerful and desirable. </p><p> At one point or another, during the last two years, practically every girl who rode at the Haywards' place had claimed that he'd done or said something to indicate he had some secret interest in her. In April of this year, nine of the girls had each bet ten dollars on who would be the first to kiss him. Diana had abstained, claiming he simply didn't appeal to her, but she volunteered to be the treasurer-and silently prayed she'd never have to hand the booty over to a winner. Earlier that spring, at a sleepover at the Haywards', Barb had claimed she'd won the bet the night before. For a half hour, she provided her girlfriends with dozens of titillating, imaginative, and highly improbable details about the nature of the kissing and the extent of the petting that followed. </p><p> Just when Diana thought she would surely throw up if she had to listen to another description of their body positions, Barb had flopped back on the bed and burst out laughing. "April Fools!" she called, and was immediately bombarded with handfuls of popcorn for her joke. </p><p> As miserable as Diana had been before Barb admitted to the joke, Diana hadn't betrayed by expression or word how she felt. Not then and not now. </p><p> She glanced over her shoulder and saw Cole pouring feed into the bucket in the last stall, and she knew he'd come back outside to join her in a minute. She knew a lot more about him than the other girls did, because she alone had spent substantial amounts of time with him. </p><p> She knew exactly how sunlight turned his hair to polished ebony; she'd seen the way his sudden white smile could soften the hard planes of his face and turn his eyes to liquid silver; she'd felt his hands at her waist when he came up behind her and jokingly picked her up to lift her out of his way. She'd heard the awful fury in his voice when he dragged outside one of Doug's friends who was smoking in the stable and verbally flayed him for creating a fire hazard for the horses. </p><p>She'd also seen him deliver a litter of kittens while he murmured gentle encouragement to the mother, and she'd seen him revive what had appeared to be a stillborn kitten by massaging it with his fingers. </p><p>She'd actually experienced some of the fantasies the other girls could only dream of, but there were two enormous differences between Diana and the others: she was smart enough not to try to make her fantasies into reality, and she was wise enough to understand and accept that this casual friendship she shared with him was all there was ever going to be. </p><p> She realized that she would never know how it felt to have his mouth cover hers in a kiss, or his arms close around her, or his hands press her tightly against him. She accepted all that with only a little regret. Because she was also smart enough to know that if he ever made up his mind to kiss her, she probably wouldn't be able to handle it or control him. </p><p> Cole wouldn't bother with a lot of smooth talk and rehearsed strategies; he'd expect her to be a match for him in every way. But she wasn't, and she knew it. Even if she weren't hopelessly naive compared to him, they were as different as two people could possibly be. </p><p> Cole was blunt, reckless, and earthy. Diana was reserved, cautious, and hopelessly proper. </p><p> He was motorcycles and blue jeans and battered duffel bags, with a need to blaze his own trails through life. </p><p> She was BMWs and prom gowns and matched luggage, with a need to stay on smooth, paved roads. </p><p> Copyright � 1996 by Judith McNaught </p><p></p></p><h2>Spontaneous Happiness</h2><p>Everyone wants to be happy.

The environment has a profound influence on our health. The quality of air that we breathe and water we drink directly influence our condition, as does the human environment around us. A noisy, high-stress environment, for example, can interfere with our efforts to be healthy, while a quiet, natural environment supports well being. Daily food is a condensed form of the environment that we internalize each day, and thus has a decisive influence on health and well being. Between this book, Tired Or Toxic? You Are What You Ate, and The E. I. Syndrome, Dr. Sherry Rogers explores the relationship between diet, environment, and human health and sickness. She explains how an unnatural, overly artificial diet contributes to a variety of health problems, and how certain aspects of the modern lifestyle, including the use of artificial substances in our surroundings, can also weaken health. --- excerpts from book&#39;s Foreword</p><p></p><h2>A Christmas Carol: A Pop-Up Book</h2><p>This beautiful re-imagining of Charles Dickens&#39;s timeless fable, A Christmas Carol: A Pop-Up Book features artist Chuck Fischer&#39;s richly painted depictions of the tale of Ebenezer Scrooge and the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future, brought to life in intricate pop-up scenes by paper engineer Bruce Foster.

This third volume in Charles Swindoll's"Great Lives" series presents a fresh look at one of the most intriguing characters in the Old Testament and focuses on the virtue of forgiveness in the face of deceit and betrayal.</p></p><p><p>Charles R. Swindoll has devoted his life to the clear, practical teaching and application of God's Word. He currently pastors Stonebriar Community Church in Frisco, Texas, and serves as the chancellor of Dallas Theological Seminary. His renowned Insight for Living radio program airs around the world. Chuck and Cynthia, his partner in life and ministry, have four grown children and ten grandchildren.</p>Michael Kramer&#39;s melodious baritone beguiles the listener with the biblical account of Joseph. Kramer characterizes Joseph&#39;s brother&#39;s rage and jealousy, Joseph&#39;s imprisonment in Egypt, and his eventual rise from slavery to freedom and power. Kramer carefully depicts the emotions, the challenges, and the fears that grow into faith as Joseph follows God in spite of threatening circumstances. The depiction of Potiphar&#39;s wife&#39;s seduction of Joseph is exceptionally authentic. Kramer captures her rage when Joseph flees from her sexual advances, only to leave an incriminating scrap of his coat behind in her clenched fist. Joseph&#39;s story testifies to the power of human endurance and God&#39;s ability to take what man intends for evil and turn it into good.

But Beatrice Newgarden Witherspoon, Jessie Jenkins, and Louise Fisher are ready to take on a new project: find a husband for their young, single pastor friend Charlotte Stewart, who is too busy running a shelter in New Mexico to look for a suitable companion herself. The search for Charlotte's perfect lifemate is turning up many unexpected things�Beatrice's daughter has special news, the last person Louise would ever expect to see turns up on her doorstep, and Jessie's husband wishes to recommit to her forever. So one way or another, there will be a wedding, and perhaps more than one . . . with cake! </p></p><p><p>A retreat leader and writing teacher, Lynne Hinton is the author of numerous novels including <em>Pie Town</em>, <em>Wedding Cake</em>, <em>Christmas Cake</em>, <em>Friendship Cake</em>, <em>Hope Springs</em>, and <em>Forever Friends</em>. She also writes a mystery series under the name Jackie Lynn. She lives in New Mexico.</p>In the fifth installment of Hinton's Hope Springs series (after <i>Christmas Cake</i>), the town of Hope Springs, N.C., is abuzz over a round of weddings among the series cast of friends. In this flowery confection, pastor Charlotte Stewart is living n New Mexico, but having trouble committing to her new beau; working as director of a shelter for battered women, she fears she may fall prey to the same pitfalls as her clients. Meanwhile, back in Hope Springs, nosy friend Beatrice Witherspoon is busying herself trying to reunite her married-but-separated friends Jessie and James Jenkins. Bea's plans fizzle when she discovers that her daughter is secretly engaged&#x2014;and sending out invites. An unfortunately underserved plot line finds Louise Fisher, a lesbian, agreeing to marry the widower husband of the group's late member Margaret (who died in the last volume). Though at times brashly unsophisticated (old-fashioned recipes like clam dip and party mix fill space between chapters), Hinton's down-home charm carries the light, feel-good story with ease. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

All of this has come to Lori through the ghostly good offices of Aunt Dimity, long in her grave but always on hand when needed. Lori and Bill live in the ancestral mansion of Bill's father/law partner William. When Bill's workload keeps him from a planned trip to England with Lori, Willis Sr. takes his place, but he vanishes soon after the pair's arrival at Lori's cottage in Finch, having excused himself in the middle of a chess game with Nell, the precocious daughter of Lori's neighbors Emma and Derek Harris. Willis, Lori suspects, has seized on the trip as a chance to make peace with the English branch of the family, long estranged over some ancient feud. Lori, accompanied by Nell and guided by Aunt Dimity, keeps missing Willis as she follows in his wake, but along the way she meets the younger generation of Willis cousins--Gerald, Arthur, and Lucy--partners in a London law firm recently decimated by the departure of its senior members.

He hadn't been to this desolate spot in years. Like a lot of other residents of Beartooth, he avoided coming this way.<br><br>The afternoon sun slanted down through the dense pines, casting a long shadow over the barrow pit and the small cross nearly hidden among the weeds. The cross, though weathered from eleven years of harsh Montana weather, stood unyielding against the merciless wind that whipped the summer-dried weeds around it.<br><br>After a moment, Frank climbed out of the truck, fighting the gusts as he waded into the ditch. Someone had erected the wooden cross, though no one knew who. Back then the cross had been white. Years of blistering hot summers and fierce, long snow-laden winters had peeled away the paint, leaving the wood withered and gray.<br><br>The brisk fall wind kicked up a dust devil in the road. Frank shut his eyes as it whirled past him, pelting him with dirt. The image he'd spent years trying to banish flashed before him. He saw it again, the young woman's broken body lying in the barrow pit where it had been discarded like so much garbage.<br><br>The lonesome moan of the wind in the tops of the thick wall of pines was the only sound on this remote rural road. That night, standing here as the coroner loaded the body, he'd sworn he would find Ginny West's killer if it was the last thing he ever did.<br><br>Now, he looked again at the cross that marked this lonely place where Ginny had died. The wind had plastered a dirty plastic grocery bag against its base.<br><br>Feeling the crippling weight of that vow and his failure, Frank crouched down and jerked the bag free. As he rose to leave, he heard the sound of a motor and looked up to see a small plane fly over.<br><br>Rylan West lay dazed in the dirt. He'd lost his hat, gotten the air knocked clean out of him and was about to be trampled by a horse if he didn't move&#x2014;and quickly.<br><br>To add insult to injury, as he lay on the ground staring up at all that blue sky, he saw Destry Grant's red-and-white Cessna 182 fly over. He didn't have to see the woman behind the controls to know it was <em>her</em> plane. Hell, he could call up Destry Grant's face from memory with no trouble at all and did so with frustrating regularity even though he hadn't laid eyes on her in more than ten years.<br><br>In the past few weeks that he'd been home, he'd made a point of staying out of Destry's way. He told himself he wasn't ready to see her. But a part of him knew that was pure bull. He felt guilty and he should have. The last time they'd seen each other, he'd made her a promise he hadn't kept.<br><br>Not that anyone could blame him under the circumstances. Eleven years ago he'd left Beartooth, Montana, joined the rodeo and hadn't looked back. That is, until a few weeks ago when he'd grown tired of being on the road, riding one rodeo after another until they'd become a blur of all-night drives across country.<br><br>He had awakened one morning and realized there was only one place he wanted to be. Home. He'd loaded up his horse and saddle, hooked on to his horse trailer and headed for Montana. He'd yearned for familiar country, for the scent of pine coming off the fresh snow on top of the Crazy Mountains, for his family. And maybe for Destry, as foolish as that was.<br><br>He swore now as he listened to the plane circle the W Bar G, hating that Destry was so close and yet as beyond his reach as if she were on the moon. That hadn't been the case when they were kids, he thought with a groan. Back then he couldn't have been happier about the two of them growing up on neighboring ranches. They'd been best friends until they were seventeen and then they'd been a whole lot more.<br><br>"What the hell is wrong with you?"<br><br>Rylan blinked as he looked over on the corral fence to see his younger brother Jarrett glaring down at him. To his relief, he noticed that Jarrett had hold of the unbroken stallion's halter rope. The horse was snorting and stomping, kicking up dust, angry as an old wet hen. His brother looked just as mad.<br><br>"Nothin's wrong with me," Rylan said with a groan as he got to his feet. At least physically, that was.<br><br>"If Dad finds out that you tried to ride that horse..." Jarrett shook his head and glanced toward the sky and Destry's plane. His brother let out a curse as if everything was now suddenly crystal clear.<br><br>Rylan grabbed the reins from his brother, hoping Jar-rett had the good sense not to say anything about him trying to ride one of the wild horses their father had brought home from the Wyoming auction&#x2014;or about Destry. If he and Jarrett had that particular discussion, more than likely one or both of them would end up with a black eye.<br><br>He knew how his family felt about the Grants. Hell, he felt the same way. Even after all these years, just thinking about what had happened still hurt too badly. Just as thinking about Destry did. But as hard as he tried to put her out of his mind, he couldn't do it.<br><br>"I just heard the news. It's all over town," his brother said as her plane disappeared from view.<br><br>Destry Grant banked the small plane along the east edge of the towering snow-capped Crazy Mountains and then leveled it out to fly low over the ranch.<br><br>It never failed to amaze her that everything from the mountains to the Yellowstone River was W Bar G Ranch. Say what you want about Waylon "WT" Grant&#x2014;and God knew people did, she thought&#x2014;but her father had built this ranch from nothing into what it was today.<br><br>She'd spent the past few days in Denver at a cattleman's association conference and was now anxious to get home. She was never truly comfortable until she felt Montana soil beneath her boots.<br><br>The ranch spread below her, a quilt of fall colors. Thousands of Black Angus cattle dotted the pastures now dried to the color of buckskin. Hay fields lay strewn with large golden bales stretching as far as the eye could see. At the edge of it all, the emerald green of the Yellowstone River wound its way through cot-tonwoods with leaves burnished copper in the late October air.<br><br>Destry took in the country as if breathing in pure oxygen&#x2014;until she spotted the barns and corrals of the West Ranch in the distance. But not even the thought of Rylan West could spoil this beautiful day.<br><br>The big sky was wind-scoured pale blue with wisps of clouds coming off the jagged peaks of the Crazies, as the locals called the mountain range. Behind the rugged peaks, a dark bank of clouds boiled up with the promise of a storm before the day was over.<br><br>Just past a creek tangled with dogwood, choke-cherry and willows, the huge, rambling Grant ranch house came into view. Her father had built it on the top of a hill so he'd have a three-hundred-and-sixty-degree view of his land. Like the ranch, the house was large, sprawling and had cost a small fortune. WT scoffed at the ridicule the place had generated among the locals.<br><br>"What did WT think was going to happen?" one rancher had joked before he'd noticed Destry coming into the Branding Iron Cafe for a cup of coffee last spring. "You build on top of a knob without a windbreak, and every storm that comes in is going to nail you good."<br><br>She hadn't been surprised that word had spread about what happened up at WT's big house in January. During one of the worst storms last winter, several of the doors in the new house had blown open, piling snowdrifts in the house.<br><br>Even early settlers had known better than to build on a hilltop. They always set their houses down in a hollow and planted trees to form a windbreak to protect the house from Montana's unforgiving weather.<br><br>That was another reason she'd opted to stay in the hundred-year-old homestead house down the road from WT's "folly," as it'd become known.<br><br>She was about to buzz the house to let her father know she was back, when she spotted something odd. An open gate wouldn't have normally caught her attention. But this one wasn't used anymore. Which made it strange that the barbed-wire-and-post gate lay on the ground, and there were fresh tire tracks that led to the grove of dense trees directly behind the homestead house where she lived alone.<br><br>She frowned as she headed for the ranch airstrip, wondering why anyone would have reason to drive back there. As she prepared to land, she spotted a bright red sports car heading toward the ranch in the direction of WT's folly. In this part of the state, most everyone drove a truck. Or at least a four-wheel-drive SUV. The person driving the sports car had to be lost.<br><br>After leaving the plane at the hangar, Destry drove straight up to the main house in the ranch pickup. She pulled in as the dust was settling around the red sports car she'd seen from the air. As the driver shut off his engine, she saw her father roll his wheelchair down the ramp toward them.<br><br>WT had been a handsome, physically imposing man before his accident. Not even the wheelchair could diminish his formidable strength of will, even though he was now grayer and thinner. The accident hadn't improved his disposition, either, not that it had been all that great before the plane crash.<br><br>WT was a complicated man. That was the nice way people in the county explained her father. The rest didn't mince words. Nettie Benton at the Beartooth General Store called him the meanest man in Sweet-grass County.<br><br>Right now, though, WT looked more anxious than Destry had ever seen him. As he wheeled toward the car, Destry shifted her gaze to the man who had climbed out. For a moment she didn't recognize her own brother.<br><br><em>"Carson?"</em> For eleven years, she'd wondered if she would ever see her big brother again. She ran to him, throwing herself into his arms. He chuckled as he hugged her tightly, then held her at arm's length to look at her.<br><br>"Wow, little sis, have you grown up," he said, making her laugh. She'd been seventeen when he'd left, newly graduated from high school and on her way to college that coming fall. She hated to think how young she'd been in so many ways. Or how much that tragic year was to change their lives. Seeing Carson on the ranch again brought it all back with sharp, breath-stealing pain for everything they'd lost.<br><br>Carson had filled out from the twenty-year-old college boy he'd been. His hair was still a lighter chestnut from her own. They both had gotten their hair color from their mother, she'd heard, although she'd never seen as much as a snapshot of Lila Gray Grant. Unable to bear looking at photographs of Lila, her father had destroyed them all after his wife's death.<br><br>Her brother's eyes were their father's clear blue, while her own were more faded like worn denim. It had always annoyed her that her brother had been spared the sprinkling of freckles that were scattered across her cheeks and nose. He used to tease her about them. She wondered if he remembered.<br><br>Around his blue eyes was a network of small wrinkles that hadn't been there eleven years ago and a sadness in his gaze she didn't recall. Like their father, he was strikingly handsome and always had been. But now he was tanned, muscled and looked like a man who'd been on a long vacation.<br><br>"What are you doing here? I mean&#x2014;" She heard the crunch of her father's wheelchair tires on the concrete beside her and saw Carson brace himself to face their father. Some things hadn't changed.<br><br>"Carson," WT said and extended his hand.<br><br>Her brother gave a slight nod, his face expressionless as he reached down to shake his father's hand. WT pulled him closer and awkwardly put an arm around the son he hadn't seen in years.<br><br>For the first time in her life, Destry saw tears in their father's eyes. He hadn't cried at her mother's funeral, at least that's what she'd heard through the county grapevine.<br><br>"It's good to have you home, Carson," their father said, his voice hoarse with emotion.<br><br>Carson said nothing as his gaze shifted to Destry. In that instant, she saw that his coming back to Montana hadn't been voluntary.<br><br>Her heart dropped at what she saw in her brother's face. Fear.<br><br></p><h2>The Witch of Lime Street: S�ance, Seduction, and Houdini in the Spirit World</h2><p><p><b>History comes alive in this textured account of the rivalry between Harry Houdini and the so-called Witch of Lime Street, whose iconic lives intersected at a time when science was on the verge of embracing the paranormal.<br><br></b>The 1920s are famous as the golden age of jazz and glamour, but it was also an era of fevered yearning for communion with the spirit world, after the loss of tens of millions in the First World War and the Spanish-flu epidemic. A desperate search for reunion with dead loved ones precipitated a tidal wave of self-proclaimed psychics&#x2014;and, as reputable media sought stories on occult phenomena, mediums became celebrities. <br><br>Against this backdrop, in 1924, the pretty wife of a distinguished Boston surgeon came to embody the raging national debate over Spiritualism, a movement devoted to communication with the dead. Reporters dubbed her the blonde Witch of Lime Street, but she was known to her followers simply as Margery. Her most vocal advocate was none other than Sherlock Holmes' creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who believed so thoroughly in Margery's powers that he urged her to enter a controversial contest, sponsored by <i>Scientific American </i>and offering a large cash prize to the first medium declared authentic by its impressive five-man investigative committee. &nbsp;Admired for both her exceptional charm and her dazzling effects, Margery was the best hope for the psychic practice to be empirically verified.&nbsp; Her supernatural gifts beguiled four of the judges. There was only one left to convince...the acclaimed escape artist, Harry Houdini.<br><br>David Jaher's extraordinary debut culminates in the showdown between Houdini, a relentless unmasker of charlatans, and Margery, the nation's most credible spirit medium. <i>The Witch of Lime Street</i>, the first book to capture their electric public rivalry and the competition that brought them into each other&#x2019;s orbit, returns us to an oft-mythologized era to deepen our understanding of its history, all while igniting our imagination and engaging with the timeless question: Is there life after death?</p></p><p><p><b>DAVID JAHER</b> received a BA from Brandeis University and an MFA&nbsp;in film production from New York University.

With the result something of a foregone conclusion &#x2014; you'll notice "psychical research" is not currently a household industry &#x2014; it's all the more impressive that Jaher builds the sense of mystery effortlessly, without seeming as though he's actually withholding any of the key information about the society medium who would rock&nbsp;<i>Scientific American</i>. He chronicles Mrs. Crandon's social circle with a mixture of poetic sympathy and journalistic distance. (And he backstories her husband Dr. Crandon with a beat of the what-the-hell candor that makes this book such a page-turner.)...But like any good magician, Jaher has other tricks up his sleeve. As the plot thickens, we begin to see macabre glimpses of things falling apart: examples of Houdini's short temper, power struggles between journalism and academia, hints of Mina's personal and family demons. It was a raucous age, and&nbsp;<i>The Witch of Lime Street</i>&nbsp;makes sure its spooky showdown happens smack in the middle of the action.

It had to establish control over a disparate and needy population and prepare the country for global economic competition. As part of this effort, the government enlisted the energy of artists and intellectuals in cultivating a distinctly Mexican identity. It devised a project for the incorporation of indigenous peoples and oversaw a vast, innovative program in the arts. <i>The Eagle and the Virgin</i> examines the massive nation-building project Mexico undertook between 1920 and 1940.<p></p><p>Contributors explore the nation-building efforts of the government, artists, entrepreneurs, and social movements; their contradictory, often conflicting intersection; and their inevitably transnational nature. Scholars of political and social history, communications, and art history describe the creation of national symbols, myths, histories, and heroes to inspire patriotism and transform workers and peasants into efficient, productive, gendered subjects. They analyze the aesthetics of nation building made visible in murals, music, and architecture; investigate state projects to promote health, anticlericalism, and education; and consider the role of mass communications, such as cinema and radio, and the impact of road building. They discuss how national identity was forged among social groups, specifically political Catholics, industrial workers, middle-class women, and indigenous communities. Most important, the volume weighs in on debates about the tension between the eagle (the modernizing secular state) and the Virgin of Guadalupe (the Catholic defense of faith and morality). It argues that despite bitter, violent conflict, the symbolic repertoire created to promote national identity and memory making eventually proved capacious enough to allow the eagle and the virgin to coexist peacefully.</p><p>Contributors.

He lives in Los Angeles.Dancing with Myself PROLOGUE<p></p> <br><br> THEY SAY IF YOU HEAR THE BANG, YOU&#x2019;RE STILL ALIVE<p></p> <br>BY THE MORNING OF FEBRUARY 6, 1990, I&#x2019;d been living on a fine edge for more than a decade, always courting disaster to experience the biggest high. I&#x2019;d been living the deranged life. I felt so nihilistic, yet why hadn&#x2019;t I just tuned in and dropped out? Instead, I followed Jim Morrison&#x2019;s credo, the credo of Coleridge and, at one point, Wordsworth, the credo of self-discovery through self-destruction I so willfully subscribed to until this moment:<br> <br>Live every day as if it&#x2019;s your last, and one day you&#x2019;re sure to be right.<br> <br>On this fateful morning, I&#x2019;m standing wide-awake at dawn in the living room of my house in Hollywood Hills, overlooking the Los Angeles basin that falls and stretches away toward the high-rising pillars of downtown. I haven&#x2019;t slept, still buzzing from the night&#x2019;s booze and illicit substances lingering in my bloodstream, staring at the view of the city beginning its early morning grumblings. Daylight unfolds and casts shadows within the elevation, as if God is slowly revealing his colors for the day from his paint box, the hues of brown and green of earth and foliage offset by the bleached white of the protruding rocks that hold my home in place on the hillside.<br> <br>Standing at my window, I hear sirens blaring in the distance. Someone wasn&#x2019;t so lucky, I think as I tune in to the rumble of cars ferrying tired and impatient commuters on the 101 freeway that winds through the Cahuenga Pass, the sound of a world slowly getting back in motion. The constant moan of the freeway echoes that of my tired and played-out soul.<br> <br>Just the night before, after almost two years of work, we put the aptly titled album Charmed Life to bed. I&#x2019;m feeling some pressure, home early from the de rigueur studio party. I say that as if we threw one party to celebrate the completion of the album, but the truth is that the party went on for two years. Two years of never-ending booze, broads, and bikes, plus a steady diet of pot, cocaine, ecstasy, smack, opium, quaaludes, and reds. I passed out in so many clubs and woke up in the hospital so many times; there were incidents of returning to consciousness to find I was lying on my back, looking at some uniformly drab, gray hospital ceiling, cursing myself and thinking that I was next in line to die outside an L.A. nightclub or on some cold stone floor, surrounded by strangers and paparazzi.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve been taking GHB, a steroid, to help relieve symptoms of the fatigue that has been plaguing me and preventing me from working out and keeping my body in some semblance of good shape. If you take too much GHB, which I&#x2019;m prone to do, it&#x2019;s like putting yourself in a temporary coma for three hours; to observers, it appears as if you are gone from this world.<br> <br>When we began recording in 1988, we promised each other we&#x2019;d be cool and focused, and not wholly indulge in drugs and debauchery. But as weeks stretched into months, Fridays often finished early with &#x201c;drop-time&#x201d;&#x2014;the moment we all took ecstasy. And then Friday soon became Thursday and so on, until all rules were taboo. We somehow managed to make music through the constant haze. It seemed like every few days I was recovering from yet another wild binge, and it took three days to feel &#x201c;normal&#x201d; again. The album proved to be slow going and the only way to feel any kind of relief from the pressure was to get blotto, avoid all human feelings, and reach back into the darkness once again. Somewhere in that darkness, I told myself, there was a secret of the universe or some hidden creative message to be found.<br> <br>We&#x2019;d invite girls to come to the studio to listen to the music. Mixing business with pleasure seemed the best way to see if the new songs worked. We&#x2019;d be snorting lines of cocaine, and then the girls would start dancing. Before long, they&#x2019;d end up having sex with one or more of us on the studio floor. Once the party was in full swing, we walked around naked but for our biker boots and scarves. Boots and Scarves became the running theme.<br> <br>The girls loved it and got in on the act. It helped that we recruited them at the local strip bars; they felt comfortable naked. We had full-on orgies in those studios we inhabited for months. It was like a glorified sex club. We were all about instant gratification, lords of the fix.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d like to think this was all in the name of song-searching: the sex and drugs amped up the music, the songs arriving in the midst of chaos, cigarettes stubbed out into plates of food, the bathroom floor covered with vomit, sweaty sex going on all over the studio as we tried out our guitar riffs and mixes. The sound of our mixes, turned up loud, drowned out the background noise of sucking and fucking. Songs must be written. The ideas must flow. The flow must go to one&#x2019;s most base desires. Without constraint.<br> <br>Now that it&#x2019;s all said and done, I feel exhausted and shattered. The keyed-up feeling that prevents me from sleeping is the result of the care and concern I put into making a record that will decide the course of my future. That&#x2019;s the sort of pressure I put on myself every time. Then there&#x2019;s the fact that the production costs have been astronomical; the need to keep the bandwagon rolling has drained my spirit and sapped my will.<br> <br>Months later, Charmed Life will go on to sell more than a million copies. The &#x201c;Cradle of Love&#x201d; single and video, directed by David Fincher, will both become massive hits. But I don&#x2019;t know this when I retreat to my home alone at 2 a.m., intending to get some rest after wrapping recording. The breakup of my relationship with my girlfriend, Perri, the mother of my son, Willem, has left me bereft, but finishing the album has been my only priority. &#x201c;If the thing is pressed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lee will surrender,&#x201d; Lincoln telegraphed Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox in 1865. And then: &#x201c;Let the thing be pressed.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s a rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll attitude. The difficult has to be faced straight-on and the result forged out of sweat and tears. That&#x2019;s where I take my inspiration.<br> <br>The wide-screen version of the last few years&#x2019; tumultuous events plays in my subconscious and cannot be ignored. What can I do to keep away these blues that rack my thoughts and creep into my bones? It&#x2019;s a fine day, warming up, the sun burning off the morning smog. Still, I feel uneasy, dissatisfied in the pit of my stomach. With the album now finished, I&#x2019;ll have to take stock of life and contemplate the emptiness without Perri and Willem.<br> <br>The bike will blow away these post-album blues, I think. As I open the garage door, the chrome of my 1984 Harley-Davidson Wide Glide gleams with expectation, beckoning me.<br> <br>The L.A. traffic is thick and the warmth of the sun is fresh on my face, its glow spreading over my bare head. California has yet to pass legislation making the wearing of helmets compulsory, and I&#x2019;ve always liked the feel of the wind in my hair. My bike clears its throat with a deep, purring growl. The gleaming black tank and chrome fixtures flash in the sharp, sacrosanct daylight. I&#x2019;ve opted for all denim to match the blue-sky high.<br> <br>The Harley&#x2019;s firm hold on the road this morning is comforting, and I begin to relax; its curves perfectly match the contours of the pavement below. I try to outrun the demons. The sweet, jasmine-honeyed air intoxicates my spinning mind. I rev the bike, which reacts easily to my commands as I sail breezily along the winding canyon road toward Sunset Boulevard. The lush greenery and trees lining the road refresh my thoughts, and my concentration wanders. My mind is filled with images of Peter O&#x2019;Toole as Lawrence of Arabia speeding through the English countryside, testing his bike, pushing it to the limit, when&#x2014;<br> <br>WHAM!!!<br> <br>An almighty explosion interrupts my silent reverie. I feel my body violently tumbling through the air, floating into a pure void. I black out before landing.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>I SENSE BEINGS CROWDING AROUND me. I hear voices, some very close and loud, others softer and farther away. The whirl of movement in this dark vortex tells me that other worlds exist; I can feel their magnetic pull. People have a gravity of presence, and I can feel their movement as I slowly regain my senses. I&#x2019;m not sure if I&#x2019;m alive or dead.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m transported to just above myself. There are no white tunnels or distant lights, rather a red dimension. Walking through the shadow world on the other side, I see the beings who grace the crimson night crowding around to greet me. They pour out their love. The strange dimension sends a beam of thought: You&#x2019;re all right. We love you. Don&#x2019;t worry, here is love. They press and push. The circle of people holds my soul in a warm embrace.<br> <br>I can feel their minds, good thoughts passing through me. I am one with them, yet still an individual. The warm red permeates my mind; a florid sun must light this world. I am connected to others who no longer live, but who exist in this red dimension. Red is the color of life, the color of death, a red masque, a celebration. The male and female voices are soft and resonate in my soul. We love you, they say. There are no individuals, no identification.<br> <br>Now I slip into a warp of darkness, pulled from this loving dimension. I hang in a slip of time between life and death; I slowly begin to regain consciousness. The screen behind my eyes has yet to come on. It&#x2019;s as if God has not yet spoken those immortal words &#x201c;Let there be light.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>I HEARD THE CRASH. BIKERS say that if you don&#x2019;t hear that crash, you&#x2019;re already dead. I open my eyes. Bright sunlight floods in. I&#x2019;m staring at the curb, my forehead resting just an inch from the sidewalk&#x2019;s edge. I&#x2019;m lying in a bloody heap in the street, my Harley not too far away.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m positioned awkwardly on my left side, on top of my left arm. I free my arm, only to see something is very wrong. My wrist is fucked up, leaving my fingers contorted, clawlike.<br> <br>I lift up to look at the rest of my body and a terrific pain courses through my nerve endings. Any attempt at movement brings waves of agony that rack me to the core. Looking down, I see that my right boot is without a heel, smashed into the asphalt. I try to move my leg; nothing happens. I see a bloody, mangled stump sticking through my torn jeans. It looks as if my foot and my lower leg are separated from me, the denim lying flat on the pavement beneath my knee, a pool of blood quickly spreading from the soaked cloth. I lie there and wait for help.<br> <br>The immortal biker slogan &#x201c;There are those who have been down and there are those who are going down&#x201d; reverberates through my brain as I watch a man walk across the street. Though he sees my condition, he asks, &#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; Ignoring the question, I blurt out, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got Blue Cross Blue Shield&#x2014;take me to Cedars-Sinai,&#x201d; before passing out.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m zapped back to reality with a sharp jolt as the EMTs move me from the street to the ambulance on a stretcher. They start to cut my clothes off, and I actually think to myself, Just as well I didn&#x2019;t wear my favorite leather riding jacket. I had contemplated wearing it that morning but opted for the denim instead as it was such a beautiful day. Funny how shit like this runs through your mind no matter what the circumstances. I am super-aware, yet at the same time in almost unbearable discomfort.<br> <br>The herky-jerky movements of the ambulance as it picks its way through traffic&#x2014;slowing down then speeding up&#x2014;combined with the blaring siren are strangely comforting. The actions of the two paramedics are cool, calm, and deliberate. I am in good hands. The speed with which they transfer me to the hospital gurney and take me to the emergency operating room reminds me of an experience I had in Thailand the year before, where I was escorted speedily out of the country by a platoon of the Thai Army, tranquilized and lashed to a military stretcher. By the time I reach the emergency room, the pain is so intense my thoughts are stopped cold as my injuries wreak havoc on my nervous system. I am probably screaming, but I am deaf to any sound.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>THE FACT IS, I HAVE been deaf to many things. The road I&#x2019;ve taken may have been the one less traveled, but definitely not in a good way. It was littered with disregarded warning signs. Despite spiritual reassurance by those friendly beings regarding my mortality, back in the real world, it&#x2019;s payback time. It is not the first time nor the last that William Broad will be held to account and asked to pay a heavy price.</p><h2>Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder (Hannah Swenson Mysteries)</h2><p>While trying to avoid her mother&#39;s matchmaking schemes, Hannah Swensen stirs up trouble when she investigates the murder of her punctual delivery man, whose body was discovered behind her bakery surrounded by her world-famous chocolate chip cookies. Reissue.</p><p>JOANNE FLUKE is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Hannah Swensen mysteries, which include <i>Double Fudge Brownie Murder, Blackberry Pie Murder</i>, <i>Cinnamon Roll Murder</i>, and the book that started it all, <i>Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder.</i> That first installment in the series premiered as <i>Murder, She Baked:&nbsp; A Chocolate Chip Cookie Mystery</i> on the Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries Channel. Like Hannah Swensen, Joanne Fluke was born and raised in a small town in rural Minnesota, but now lives in Southern California. Please visit her online at www.JoanneFluke.comHannah Swensen of Lake Eden, Minnesota, has a better excuse than most of fictions lady sleuths to excuse her nosiness: her sister Andreas husband Bill Todd is deputy sheriff for the county and Hannah tirelessly maintains that shes helping him. During her inter-snooping hours, she runs The Cookie Jar, a coffee shop serving and selling the goodies Hannah bakes in the back of the store. Her supplies are delivered daily by Ron LaSalle, whom she often passes on her way to work. On this fateful day, Rons truck is soon parked behind the store, but he fails to reappear. When Hannah finds him seated in the truck, the window open, a bullet through his chest, shes inspired to work her way through the townspeople, looking for a motive for Rons death, even as she manfully resists her widowed mothers attempts to find her a husband. The annual bash given by wealthy Del and Judith Woodley pairs Hannah with pleasant dentist Norman Rhodes, but Hannah is soon caught up by the latest scandal: the disappearance of Nat Turner, owner of the huge Cozy Cow Dairy, who didnt show at the Buttermakers Convention, where he was to make the opening speech. Needless to say, its Hannah who finds Maxs body and evidence of the loan-sharking activities that provide a likely motive for his murder. Hannahs a likable sort despite her bent for taking over; the authors style is easygoing if slowed by too much inane chatter. In all: a modestly entertaining debut with some delectable recipes as a bonus. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

What the Puritans were trying to suppress was a holiday marked by boisterous invasions of the homes of wealthy. As recently as the early 19 century, Christmas reveling often resulted in violence and riots. In this book, Nissenbaum explores the not-always-proud history of Christmas in American culture. 46 illustrations.</p><p>This scholarly analysis of our modern celebration of Christmas pulls together a thoroughly convincing case for the widely accepted notion that it is a 19th-century creation, indeed a deliberate reformation and taming of a holiday with wilder pagan origins. Christmas was set at December 25 in the fourth century, not for any biblical link with Christ&#39;s birth, but because the church hoped to annex and Christianize the existing midwinter pagan feast. This latter was based on the seasonal agricultural plenty, with the year&#39;s food supply newly in store, and nothing to do in the fields. It was a time of drinking and debauchery from the Roman Saturnalia to the English Mummers. The Victorians hijacked the holiday, and Victorian writers helped turn it into a feast of safe domesticity and a cacophonous chime of retail cash registers.Stephen Nissenbaum is Professor of History at the University of Massachusetts.</p><h2>1969: The Year Everything Changed</h2><p>For the fortieth anniversary of 1969, Rob Kirkpatrick takes a look back at a year when America witnessed many of the biggest landmark achievements, cataclysmic episodes, and generation-defining events in recent history.<br><br> 1969 was the year that saw Apollo 11 land on the moon, the Cinderella stories of Joe Namath&#x2019;s Jets and the Miracle Mets,&#x201d; the Harvard student strike and armed standoff at Cornell, the People&#x2019;s Park riots, the first artificial heart transplant and first computer network connection, the Manson family murders and cryptic Zodiac Killer letters, the Woodstock music festival, <i>Easy Rider</i>, Kurt Vonnegut&#x2019;s <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, the Battle of Hamburger Hill, the birth of punk music, the invasion of Led Zeppelin, the occupation of Alcatraz, death at Altamont Speedway, and much more. It was a year that pushed boundaries on stage (<i>Oh! Calcutta!</i>), screen (<i>Midnight Cowboy</i>), and the printed page (<i>Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex</i>), witnessed the genesis of the gay rights movement at Stonewall, and started the era of the no fault&#x201d; divorce. Richard Nixon became president, the New Left squared off against the Silent Majority, William Ayers co-founded the Weatherman Organization, and the nationwide Moratorium provided a unifying force in the peace movement.<br><br> Compelling, timely, and quite simply a blast to read, <i>1969</i> chronicles the year through all its ups and downs, in culture and society, sports, music, film, politics, and technology. This is a book for those who survived 1969, or for those who simply want to feel as alive as those who lived through this time of amazing upheaval.</p><p><b>Rob Kirkpatrick</b> is a literary agent, editor, and author.

His creative writing has been published by <i>Aethlon</i> and <i>Slow Trains</i>. He has published the books of many well-known authors.Lamenting all the attention 1968 has gotten with assassinations and riots, Kirkpatrick argues that the following year was more than a little&nbsp;significant,&nbsp;too. Beginning with a &#x201c;selected timeline,&#x201d; Kirkpatrick goes on to chronicle a dizzying array of major events: Richard Nixon&#x2019;s election in November 1968&nbsp;as president; the covert bombing of Cambodia; Apollo 11 landing on the moon; student antiwar protests from Harvard to Berkeley; disclosure of the My Lai massacre; the sexual revolution manifested on stage, in&nbsp;literature and&nbsp;movies, and at outdoor festivals; startling innovations in&nbsp;the music world;&nbsp;the &#x201c;days of rage&#x201d; protest kicked off during the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago; the first message sent via the ARPANET, precursor of the Internet. Kirkpatrick asserts that 1969 was the birth of modern America and sets out to relate how this incredible year reflected deep underlying changes in American culture. The book is divided into&nbsp;four parts that roughly outline the year, including&nbsp;&#x201c;sexual revolutions of springtime&#x201d; and &#x201c;the apocalyptic standoffs at year&#x2019;s end.&#x201d; A riveting look at a pivotal year. --Vanessa Bush</p><h2>Late Antique, Early Christian and Mediaeval Art: Selected Papers (Meyer Schapiro Selected Papers)</h2><p>Applies ideas drawn from the history of secular life, judicial and political history, social customs, religious psychology, linguistics, and folklore to works of art spanning the period from the end of antiquity to the late Middle Ages</p><p></p><h2>Something&#39;s Not Quite Right</h2><p>A collection of thirty-three paintings, each of which challenges the viewer to find something wrong.</p><p>This is Guy Billout&#39;s eighth book in a career that has spanned thirty-three years and includes four &#34;Ten Best Books of the Year&#34; honours from the New York Times. He may live in New York but his style, vision, and technique remain decidedly European; while his depictions of images, scenes, and activities are sophisticated without being coy or cute.This gallery of surreal images by Billout (Number 24) does not follow any narrative. Instead, each high-definition graphic presents an independent scene from nature or a sharp architectural rendering in which "something's not quite right." A page labeled "Dune" pictures a smooth white mountain against a blue sky; a person in robes climbs one side, suggesting desert sand, while a figure in a parka climbs the other, suggesting drifted snow. In "Secession," Billout neatly bisects all the bridges that cross the Seine River, allowing Paris's Ile de la Cit&#x201a; to float free; in "Skyscraper," he pictures a pointy steeple scratching a blue line across the face of the full moon. New York's Flatiron Building features in two panels, forcing its way through a snowy crust ("Ice Age") and poised on the brink of a sand-colored abyss where Broadway and Fifth Avenue used to intersect ("Canyon"). Billout's dark humor comes through in images like "Probabilities," which pictures a zebra whose stripes form a bull's-eye pattern and, in the foreground, the silhouette of a hunter and a rifle's barrel; he has a more whimsical touch in "Attack," which pictures a military general's statue, a solitary pedestrian recoiling in shock, and a snowball which seems to have come out of nowhere. Billout illustrates for the Atlantic Monthly, and it is easy to imagine these puzzling stand-alone images as magazine covers; admirers of Magritte or Istvan Banyai will want to take a look.

The toast of London, lauded by Europeans as diverse as Voltaire and Gibbon, Wheatley was for a time the most famous black woman in the West. Though Benjamin Franklin received her and George Washington thanked her for poems she dedicated to him, Thomas Jefferson refused to acknowledge her gifts. &#34;Religion, indeed, has produced a Phillis Wheatley,&#34; he wrote, &#34;but it could not produce a poet.&#34; In other words, slaves have misery in their lives, and they have souls, but they lack the intellectual and aesthetic endowments required to create literature.In this book based on his 2002 Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities at the Library of Congress, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., explores the pivotal roles that Wheatley and Jefferson have played in shaping the black literary tradition. He brings to life the characters and debates that fermented around Wheatley in her day and illustrates the peculiar history that resulted in Thomas Jefferson&#39;s being lauded as a father of the black freedom struggle and Phillis Wheatley&#39;s vilification as something of an Uncle Tom. It is a story told with all the lyricism and critical skill that have placed Gates at the forefront of American letters.</p><p><b>Henry Louis Gates Jr.</b> is W.E.B. Du Bois Professor of Humanities, chair of the Afro-American Studies Department, and director of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research at Harvard University.Gates brings scholarly insight and a love of black literature to this examination of how Wheatley, the first published African American poet, has survived the judgment of past and contemporary critics. After her poems appeared in 1773, distinguished American citizens (mostly white male slaveholders) set out to determine if Wheatley, or for that matter any black person, was capable of the higher thoughts and emotions required to create poetry. Underlying the debate was the humanity of blacks, the justification for their enslavement, and the moral culpability of the slaveholders. While Benjamin Franklin and George Washington accepted Wheatley's talent, Thomas Jefferson remained skeptical, shifting the focus from the authenticity of her authorship to the quality of her work. Generations later, black nationalists would also focus on the ideological quality of Wheatley's work, vilifying her as an apologist for slavery. But in this slim, lively volume, Gates extols Wheatley's enduring literary significance and Jefferson's contribution to spurring a tradition of black literature that was first aimed at proving equality and came to signify a black aesthetic. <i>Vanessa Bush</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Freedom from an established way of seeing, making, and marketing art fueled their creativity, which in turn inspired the city. Today Los Angeles has four museums dedicated to contemporary art, around one hundred galleries, and thousands of artists. Here, at last, is the book that tells the saga of how the scene came into being, why a prevailing Los Angeles permissiveness, 1960s-style, spawned countless innovations, including Andy Warhol's first exhibition, Marcel Duchamp's first retrospective, Frank Gehry's mind-bending architecture, Rudi Gernreich's topless bathing suit, Dennis Hopper's <i>Easy Rider</i>, even the Beach Boys, the Byrds, the Doors, and other purveyors of a California style. In the 1960s, Los Angeles was the epicenter of cool.</p></p><p><p><b>Hunter Drohojowska-Philp</b> is the author of <i>Full Bloom: The Art and Life of Georgia O'Keeffe</i>, considered the most definitive biography of the popular artist. She lives in Los Angeles, where she is a journalist and art critic for <i>Artnet</i>, <i>ARTnews</i> and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>.</p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p><b>1963: Andy and Marcel</b></p><p>The seven-foot Elvis in the Ferus Gallery window was startling, even by Los Angeles standards. In the gallery's back room, paintings of Elizabeth Taylor, with her outsized red lips and slashes of bright blue eye shadow, greeted visitors. Andy Warhol was fixated on celebrities and it wouldn't be long before he would become one himself.</p><p>A feeling of excitement charged the balmy evening air outside, and North La Cienega Boulevard traffic slowed as drivers gawked at the scene. Inside, stylishly coifed women in sleeveless dresses mingled with Los Angeles artists, awkward young men outfitted in thrift-store splendor. Warhol entered the filled-to-capacity gallery wearing a carnation in the lapel of his Brooks Brothers blazer.</p><p>In 1963 Los Angeles became a mecca for those who rejected the old and embraced the new in art, film, fashion, and music. For many artists, the city's tenuous attachment to history and tradition translated as openness to fresh ideas. Warhol's show contributed to the dawning realization that Los Angeles itself could be the next big thing.</p><p>Warhol was nervous as his exhibition opened on the evening of&nbsp;September 30. He had had just two previous exhibitions, the first held the previous summer at Ferus. Though Warhol today is considered the quintessential New York artist, he received his first break in Los Angeles when the suave&#x2014;some would say fawning&#x2014;Irving Blum and the perspicacious but flighty Walter Hopps took a chance on the young artist. Warhol's paintings of Campbell's soup cans, thirty-two to be exact, each painstakingly lettered with the appropriate flavor, were arranged on a shelf that girdled the walls, turning the gallery into a grocery store of sorts. Hopps's wife, Shirley, recalled, "It was one of those times when we knew we were onto something."1</p><p>Not everyone agreed. The show was ridiculed in a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> cartoon of two barefoot beatniks in the "Farout Art Gallery" looking at the paintings of soup cans and musing, "Frankly, the cream of asparagus does nothing for me, but the terrifying intensity of the chicken noodle gives me a real Zen feeling." Nearby, David Stuart mocked Ferus by arranging a pyramid of Campbell's soup in the window of his gallery with a sign: "Get the real thing for only 29 cents a can."2</p><p>Blum convinced some collectors to purchase Warhol's soup-can paintings for $100 apiece. After a chat with art critic John Coplans, one of the first to recognize the importance of serial imagery, Blum agreed that Warhol's everyday Pop art signaled the end of the individual masterpiece; he was determined that the pictures remain together as a set. He persuaded collectors to return the half-dozen soup-can paintings that he had managed to sell. Then he asked Warhol if he could buy all of them on a layaway plan: $1,000 for the entire set to be paid over the next year.3</p><p>Warhol didn't need the money. For years, he had been one of the most successful illustrators in New York City, known for his shoe drawings for I. Miller, easily making around $50,000 a year. But this was different. This was art. Warhol was sufficiently pleased to agree to the deal and sign up for another show with Ferus. He also silk-screened four portraits of the energetic entrepreneurial owner.</p><p>What a difference a year could make in the 1960s, a decade of seismic shifts. In August 1962, Warhol, working with studio assistant Gerard Malanga, abandoned the paintbrush for the silk screen. His first silk-screened canvas was turquoise and covered by rows of Troy Donahue head shots, each face of the Hollywood heartthrob framed in a yearbook-style oval. Four months later, due to an unexpected gap in her schedule, Eleanor Ward gave Warhol his first New York show at the Stable Gallery, where Robert Rauschenberg and Cy Twombly had had their first shows. It sold out.</p><p>Pop was gaining momentum as a movement of sorts by the time Warhol, to save on shipping, sent a roll of silvered canvas to Ferus with instructions to cut out as many images of Elvis as needed. Shirley Hopps remembered that Warhol sent no directions so she, Blum, and the gallery artists spent an evening cutting them into twos or threes in a rather haphazard manner, not unlike the assembly line technique at Warhol's East Forty-seventh Street studio, the Factory, in New York.</p><p>To get to the opening, Warhol and Malanga, along with Taylor Mead and Wynn Chamberlain, drove across country for three days in a station wagon with a mattress in the back and the radio blaring songs by Leslie Gore, the Ronettes, and Bobby Vinton. Everything along the highway looked like Pop art to them. "We were seeing the future and we knew it for sure," Warhol observed.4</p><p>They never suspected that Los Angeles could be booked. Because of the World Series, most hotels were full so Warhol called actors Dennis Hopper and his wife Brooke Hayward. She, in turn, called her father in New York, producer Leland Hayward, and convinced him to give them his suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Los Angeles started to look promising.</p><p>Warhol had met Hopper in New York through Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Henry Geldzahler. Warhol once said, "Henry gave me all of my ideas" and made a film consisting only of Geldzahler smoking a cigar for ninety minutes. Impressed by this duo, Hopper immediately bought one of Warhol's double silk screens of the <i>Mona Lisa</i> and invited him to come with Geldzahler to the soundstage to watch his guest-star performance on the TV show <i>The Defenders.</i> Not long after, Hopper flew to New York and went with Hopps and Blum to the studio of Roy Lichtenstein, where he immediately bought the artist's comic book&#x2013;style sunset painting for $750. "Everybody was talking about the return to reality," Hopper recalled. "This is our reality&#x2014;the comic books and soup cans, man."5</p><p>Lean and edgy in appearance, Hopper was drawn to advanced art from the day he saw his first Jackson Pollock painting at the home of actor Vincent Price, who had used his profits from scary movies to amass an impressive collection. "When I saw that, I got it immediately," Hopper said.6 His instincts would prove impeccable. A former poor boy from Dodge City, Kansas, Hopper was the only collector to wind up with one of Warhol's soup-can paintings because, in an effort to save $25, he managed to buy one for $75 from the Westwood gallery owned by Virginia Dwan.</p><p>The daughter of Margaret Sullavan, Brooke Hayward was a classic beauty. As Hollywood royalty, she should have been out of Hopper's league. Hayward had grown up in Greenwich, Connecticut, with Henry Fonda's children and had even been kicked out of Girl Scouts with her friend Jane. But Dennis Hopper was more than just another actor. He was wildly creative, and his charisma was undeniable in movies such as <i>Giant.</i> Together, the Hoppers were considered glittering examples of the new Hollywood, perfect hosts for a party for Warhol and friends. The very night of the artist's arrival, they invited the Ferus contingent and other young actors to their West Hollywood home at 1712 North Crescent Heights, where they had moved after losing their mansion in the 1961 fires that destroyed their Bel Air neighborhood. Their Mediterranean-style home was bohemian and furnished with circus posters, a Mexican clown sculpture, and Hopper's own collages. The <i>Mona Lisa</i> silk screen hung next to the Lichtenstein sunset. Warhol met Hopper's colleagues Robert Dean Stockwell, Russ Tamblyn, and Sal Mineo, who was Hopper's costar in <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>, as well as actors Suzanne Pleshette, Peter Fonda, who looked like a "preppy mathematician," and Troy Donahue. Joints were passed and people danced. Artist Craig Kauffman was a little shocked by the Warhol crowd. "They were all giggling and pouring sugar on the backs of each other's hands. I thought this was a little far-out."7 Whether or not this was really sugar, Kauffman never discovered.</p><p>"This party was the most exciting thing that had ever happened to me," Warhol said.8 He only regretted that he had left his Bolex movie camera in his hotel room. Warhol embraced everything about Los Angeles that tended to irritate the intellectual, the cultured, or the well-bred. "Vacant, vacuous Hollywood was everything I ever wanted to mold my life into. Plastic. White-on-white. I wanted to live my life at the level of the script of <i>The Carpetbaggers</i>."9</p><p>The opening on September 30, 1963, was less star-studded than his party, but Warhol was philosophical. "Anyway, movies were pure fun, art was work."10 Still, he was amazed by the impact of all the Elvises in the front room and the Liz Taylors in the back, as he'd never seen them all together. He made a four-minute movie of his installation. Los Angeles rising art stars attended the opening, some of whom were involved in their own versions of Pop: Ed Ruscha, Joe Goode, and Billy Al Bengston, as well as those developing their own versions of what, in a few years, would be termed "Minimalism": Larry Bell, Craig Kauffman, and Robert Irwin.</p><p>The short, slight Warhol had a congenital skin condition that he covered with pale makeup. He wore an outlandish silvery white toupee atop his own mousy brown hair, which he had been losing since 1953. His pasty face and skinny frame contrasted dramatically with the virile physiques of the L.A. artists in their twenties, all of them golden and muscular from surfing, swimming, or simply driving around in convertibles. He was slightly awed by their backslapping, cajoling, and sarcastic humor and though he was quite obviously gay, he felt completely at ease in their macho company, an artist among artists. They embraced his art as though it were both welcome and inevitable. Ruscha immediately felt "a great kinship. . . . It was like a logical departure from the kind of painting that was happening at that time."11 Warhol, in turn, supported their totally synthetic aesthetic. "The artificial fascinates me, the bright and shiny."12</p><p>Sales were brisk.

When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children&#x2014;an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare&#x2019;s only son, died in childhood. The bulk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s. He enjoyed success not only as a playwright and poet, but also as an actor and shareholder in an acting company. Although some think that sometime between 1610 and 1613 Shakespeare retired from the theater and returned home to Stratford, where he died in 1616, others believe that he may have continued to work in London until close to his death.<br><br>Barbara A.

Our bloods <br> No more obey the heavens than our courtiers' <br> Still seem as does the King's. </p><p> SECOND GENTLEMAN But what's the matter? </p><p> FIRST GENTLEMAN <br> His daughter, and the heir of 's kingdom, whom <br> He purposed to his wife's sole son -- a widow <br> That late he married -- hath referred herself <br> Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She's wedded, <br> Her husband banished, she imprisoned. All <br> Is outward sorrow, though I think the King <br> Be touched at very heart. </p><p> SECOND GENTLEMAN None but the King? </p><p> FIRST GENTLEMAN <br> He that hath lost her, too. So is the Queen, <br> That most desired the match. But not a courtier, <br> Although they wear their faces to the bent <br> Of the King's looks, hath a heart that is not <br> Glad at the thing they scowl at. </p><p> SECOND GENTLEMAN And why so? </p><p> FIRST GENTLEMAN <br> He that hath missed the Princess is a thing <br> Too bad for bad report, and he that hath her -- <br> I mean, that married her, alack, good man! <br> And therefore banished -- is a creature such <br> As, to seek through the regions of the earth <br> For one his like, there would be something failing <br> In him that should compare. I do not think <br> So fair an outward and such stuff within <br> Endows a man but he. </p><p> SECOND GENTLEMAN You speak him far. </p><p> FIRST GENTLEMAN <br> I do extend him, sir, within himself, <br> Crush him together rather than unfold <br> His measure duly. </p><p> SECOND GENTLEMAN What's his name and birth? </p><p> FIRST GENTLEMAN <br> I cannot delve him to the root. His father <br> Was called Sicilius, who did join his honor <br> Against the Romans with Cassibelan, <br> But had his titles by Tenantius, whom <br> He served with glory and admired success, <br> So gained the sur-addition Leonatus; <br> And had, besides this gentleman in question, <br> Two other sons, who in the wars o' th' time <br> Died with their swords in hand. For which their father, <br> Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow <br> That he quit being; and his gentle lady, <br> Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased <br> As he was born. The King he takes the babe <br> To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus, <br> Breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber, <br> Puts to him all the learnings that his time <br> Could make him the receiver of, which he took <br> As we do air, fast as 'twas ministered, <br> And in 's spring became a harvest; lived in court -- <br> Which rare it is to do -- most praised, most loved, <br> A sample to the youngest, to th' more mature <br> A glass that feated them, and to the graver <br> A child that guided dotards. To his mistress, <br> For whom he now is banished, her own price <br> Proclaims how she esteemed him; and his virtue <br> By her election may be truly read <br> What kind of man he is. </p><p> SECOND GENTLEMAN I honor him <br> Even out of your report. But pray you tell me, <br> Is she sole child to th' King? </p><p> FIRST GENTLEMAN His only child. <br> He had two sons -- if this be worth your hearing, <br> Mark it -- the eldest of them at three years old, <br> I' th' swathing clothes the other, from their nursery <br> Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge <br> Which way they went. </p><p> SECOND GENTLEMAN�&nbsp;�&nbsp;How long is this ago? </p><p> FIRST GENTLEMAN�&nbsp;�&nbsp;Some twenty years. </p><p> SECOND GENTLEMAN <br> That a king's children should be so conveyed, <br> So slackly guarded, and the search so slow <br> That could not trace them! </p><p> FIRST GENTLEMAN Howsoe'er 'tis strange, <br> Or that the negligence may well be laughed at, <br> Yet is it true, sir. </p><p> SECOND GENTLEMAN�&nbsp;�&nbsp;I do well believe you. </p><p> FIRST GENTLEMAN <br> We must forbear. Here comes the gentleman, <br> The Queen and Princess. </p><p> <i>They exit.</i> </p><p><br> <i>Enter the Queen, Posthumus, and Imogen.</i> </p><p> QUEEN <br> No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter, <br> After the slander of most stepmothers, <br> Evil-eyed unto you. You're my prisoner, but <br> Your jailer shall deliver you the keys <br> That lock up your restraint. -- For you, Posthumus, <br> So soon as I can win th' offended king, <br> I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet <br> The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good <br> You leaned unto his sentence with what patience <br> Your wisdom may inform you. </p><p> POSTHUMUS Please your Highness, <br> I will from hence today. </p><p> QUEEN You know the peril. <br> I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying <br> The pangs of barred affections, though the King <br> Hath charged you should not speak together. <i>She exits.</i> </p><p> IMOGEN O, <br> Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant <br> Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband, <br> I something fear my father's wrath, but nothing -- <br> Always reserved my holy duty -- what <br> His rage can do on me. You must be gone, <br> And I shall here abide the hourly shot <br> Of angry eyes, not comforted to live <br> But that there is this jewel in the world <br> That I may see again. [<i>She weeps.</i>] </p><p> POSTHUMUS My queen, my mistress! <br> O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause <br> To be suspected of more tenderness <br> Than doth become a man. I will remain <br> The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth. <br> My residence in Rome at one Philario's, <br> Who to my father was a friend, to me <br> Known but by letter; thither write, my queen, <br> And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send, <br> Though ink be made of gall. </p><p> <i>Enter Queen.</i> </p><p> QUEEN Be brief, I pray you. <br> If the King come, I shall incur I know not <br> How much of his displeasure.

George Winnick, a farmer in his sixties, is found in a homemade coffin on the side of the highway with his lips sewn shut and his veins and arteries drained of blood and filled with embalming fluid.&nbsp;Chilling as that is, it becomes even more so when Kat finds that the Perry Hollow Gazette obituary writer, Henry Goll, received a death notice for Winnick before he was killed.<br><br>Soon after, the task force from the Pennsylvania Bureau of Investigation shows up and everything takes an irreversible turn for the worse.&nbsp;Nick Donnelly, head of the task force, has been chasing the &#x201c;Betsy Ross Killer,&#x201d; so named because he&#x2019;s handy with a needle and thread, for more than&nbsp;a year.&nbsp;Winnick seems to be&nbsp;his fourth victim.&nbsp;Or is he?<br><br>Kat has never handled a murder case before, but she&#x2019;s not about to sit by while someone terrorizes her sleepy little town or her own son. But will her efforts be enough to stop a killer and&nbsp;bring calm to Perry Hollow?<br><br>A portrait of a small town in turmoil, where residents fear for their lives, Todd Ritter&#x2019;s <i>Death Notice</i> is a gripping debut from a terrific new talent in crime fiction.</p></p><p>Inspiration is like lightning. It can appear out of nowhere, bright and unexpected, leaving behind a soft buzz of electricity that makes the hair on the back of your neck stand at attention.&nbsp;But unlike lightning,&nbsp;inspiration&nbsp;has the ability to&nbsp;strike in the same place twice. For me, that was in the newsroom where I spent my nights toiling with ink-stained fingers under humming flourescent lights. <br><br>The first flash of inspiration came via a crackle of voices over the police scanner kept nearby to alert&nbsp;reporters of breaking news. It seems a coffin had fallen off a flatbed truck and was sitting on the side of the highway, alarming everyone who drove past it. One unlucky cop had to pull over, open it and see if, God forbid, there was a body inside. It turned out to be empty, thankfully, but I couldn't&nbsp;stop thinking that it would be a pretty cool way to start a mystery. Only in the fictional version, the coffin would be occupied.<br><br>The second flash arrived a few days later, when I was proofreading the obituary page -- no doubt the most bizarre aspect of my job. Usually I didn't find too many mistakes. But that night, I discovered a typo. A big one.&nbsp;An obituary mistakenly&nbsp;listed the deceased's date of death as the <i>next</i> day. Again, I started thinking: What if a crazed killer alerted people to his&nbsp;intentions by writing the obituaries of his victims before they died?<br><br>With both ideas swirling around in my brain, it occurred to me that I could combine them into an intriguing and&nbsp;suspenseful read. That, my friends, is how DEATH NOTICE was born. I hope you enjoy it. I hope you do find it both intriguing and suspenseful. And I hope that if you're seeking inspiration, you'll find it like I did -- in two loud, blinding strikes too bright to ignore.<br><br>All the best,<br>Todd RitterA native of rural Pennsylvania, Todd Ritter has been a journalist for fifteen years.

A hauntingly beautiful story of a mysterious woman who enters the lives of two families and changes them forever, Erdrich&#x2019;s classic novel, <em>The Antelope Wife</em>, has enthralled readers for more than a decade with its powerful themes of fate and ancestry, tragedy and salvation. Now the acclaimed author of <em>Shadow Tag</em> and <em>The Plague of Doves</em> has radically revised this already masterful work, adding a new richness to the characters and story while bringing its major themes into sharper focus, as it ingeniously illuminates the effect of history on families and cultures, Ojibwe and white. <br></p></p><p>As Louise Erdrich's magical novel <i>The Antelope Wife</i> opens, a cavalry soldier pursues a dog with an Ojibwa baby strapped to its back. For days he follows them through "the vast carcass of the world west of the Otter Tail River" until finally the dog allows him to approach and handle the child--a girl, not yet weaned, who latches onto his nipples until, miraculously, they begin to give milk. In another kind of novel, this might be a metaphor. But this is the fictional world of Louise Erdrich, where myth is woven deeply into the fabric of everyday life. A famous cake tastes of grief, joy, and the secret ingredient: fear. The tie that binds the antelope wife to her husband is, literally, the strip of sweetheart calico he used to yoke her hand to his. Legendary characters sew beads into colorful patterns, and these patterns become the design of the novel itself. <p> <i>The Antelope Wife</i> centers on the Roys and the Shawanos, two closely related Ojibwa families living in modern-day Gakahbekong, or Minneapolis. Urban Indians of mixed blood, they are "scattered like beads off a necklace and put back together in new patterns, new strings," and Erdrich follows them through two failed marriages, a "kamikaze" wedding, and several tragic deaths. But the plot also loops and circles back, drawing in a 100-year-old murder, a burned Ojibwa village, a lost baby, several dead twins, and another baby nursed on father's milk. </p><p> The familiar Erdrich themes are all here--love, family, history, and the complex ways these forces both bind and separate the generations, stitching them into patterns as complex as beadwork. At least initially, this swirl of characters, narratives, time lines, and connections can take a little getting used to; several of the story lines do not match up until the book's conclusion. But in the end, Erdrich's lovely, lyrical language prevails, and the reader succumbs to the book's own dreamlike logic. As <i>The Antelope Wife</i> closes, Erdrich steps back to address readers directly for the first time, and the moment expands the book's elaborate patterns well beyond the confines of its pages. "Who is beading us?" she asks. "Who are you and who am I, the beader or the bit of colored glass sewn onto the fabric of the earth?... We stand on tiptoe, trying to see over the edge, and only catch a glimpse of the next bead on the string, and the woman's hand moving, one day, the next, and the needle flashing over the horizon." -- Mary Park, editor</p><em>The Antelope Wife</em> extends the branches of the families who populate Louise Erdrich's earlier novels, and once again, her unsentimental, unsparing writing captures the Native American sense of despair, magic, and humor. Rooted in myth and set in contemporary Minneapolis, this poetic and haunting story spans a century, at the center of which is a mysterious and graceful woman known as the Antelope Wife. Elusive, silent, and bearing a mystical link to nature, she embodies a complicated quest for love and survival that impacts lives in unpredictable ways. Her tale is an unforgettable tapestry of ancestry, fate, harrowing tragedy, and redemption, that seems at once modern and eternal.</p><h2>Abiyoyo</h2><p>No one wants to hear the little boy play his ukelele anymore..."Clink, clunk, clonk." And no one wants to watch his father make things disappear..."Zoop! Zoop!"<p>Until the day the fearsome giant Abiyoyo suddenly appears in town, and all the townspeople run for their lives and the lives of their children! Nothing can stop the terrible giant Abiyoyo, nothing, that is, except the enchanting sound of the ukelele and the mysterious power of the magic wand.</p></p><p><b>Pete Seeger</b> is the well-known folk singer, musician, and storyteller. He lives in Beacon, New York.Kindergarten-Grade 3 The words in this story-song flow along with the same ease and naturalness as Seeger's well-known telling on the recording, Abiyoyo and Other Story Songs (Folkways, 1967). There are only minor changes in this version, and the style reflects an oral rather than a literary tradition as Seeger switches from past to present tense in the text. Seeger combines his sense of humor and drama to turn disturbing events to high-spirited fun, as a father and son, turned out by their neighbors as troublemakers, use the very objects that bother peoplethe boy's clinking-clonking ukelele and the father's magic wandto obliviate Abiyoyo, monster on the loose, and so come back into community favor. The tale contains levels of meaning and powerful metaphors for those who choose to pursue them. If Hays' oil-on-linen illustrations are not always successful, it may be that they seem too studied when matched with Seeger's spontaneous, colloquial style. For example, the father is a magician in the simplest sense, yet Hays renders a "magic shop" in the background, with doves, rabbits, silk hatsnot the stuff of most folk tales. In peopling the village, too, he seems to be laboring to make a global statement, surrounding the black boy and his father with people of all races, places, beliefs. His Abiyoyo is a shadowy, looming figure against the blood-red sky, at first a faceless force, growing larger, and finally a towering glaring figure full of terrible witless energy. What is surprising about this Abiyoyo is the lack of earthiness. He is not sinew and muscle, but an automaton with a metallic gleam, the huge overalls he wears seeming an incongruous folksy touch. Still, there are also some very fine illustrations here, and this is a book worthy of attention. It merits a wide audience.

She instantly knew that boxwoods that large&#x2015;twelve feet tall, fifteen feet wide&#x2015;had to be hundreds of years old. So, as it happened, was the house: Sylvester Manor had been held in the same family for eleven generations.<br> Formerly encompassing all of Shelter Island, New York, a pearl of 8,000 acres caught between the North and South Forks of Long Island, the manor had dwindled to 243 acres. Still, its hidden vault proved to be full of revelations and treasures, including the 1666 charter for the land, and correspondence from Thomas Jefferson. Most notable was the short and steep flight of steps the family had called the "slave staircase," which would provide clues to the extensive but little-known story of Northern slavery. Alongside a team of archaeologists, Griswold began a dig that would uncover a landscape bursting with stories.<br> Based on years of archival and field research, as well as voyages to Africa, the West Indies, and Europe, <i>The Manor</i> is at once an investigation into forgotten lives and a sweeping drama that captures our history in all its richness and suffering. It is a monumental achievement.</p></p><p><b>Mac Griswold</b> is a cultural landscape historian and the author of <i>Washington</i>'<i>s Gardens at Mount Vernon</i> and <i>The Golden Age of American Gardens</i>. She has won a Guggenheim Fellowship and has written for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, and <i>Travel + Leisure</i>. She lives in Sag Harbor, New York.<i>1</i> <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>THE DISCOVERY <br>&nbsp; <br> <i>Boxwood</i> <br>It has taken us about twenty minutes to get into Gardiners Creek from a mooring in the town harbor of Shelter Island, set snugly between two peninsulas, the North and South Forks of Long Island, New York, whose tips stretch out to touch the western edge of the Atlantic Ocean, where the Gulf Stream runs close to the continent as it flows north and east toward Europe. <br>The tide is full as we ease the dinghy through a big pipe that supports a bridge, a bridge so low to the water that we have to flatten ourselves on the thwarts to get through without banging our heads. The pipe acts as an echo chamber, even for a whisper. It is too narrow for us to use the oars, so we brace our hands on the curve of the low ceiling and push. A friend has brought me here to see &#x201c;something,&#x201d; but he won&#x2019;t say what. It is a summer day in 1984. <br>Finally out in the light, we see nothing but woods looming down to the water. Then, about a half mile off, at what seems to be the end of the inlet we have found our way into, phragmites and cattails fringe the shore. On our right are a few roofs, half hidden in the trees. On our left, toward the east, lies only a salt marsh where white egrets stalk in the long grasses. No houses. Not even a dock, a boat, or a mooring. Gulls wheel above a low hill covered with large trees: oak, hickory, walnut. Turning east means seeing land set back in time, so far back it looks as if it had never been inhabited. We blink, feeling tension rise between the modern world we&#x2019;ve left behind so abruptly and the past we are rowing into. <br>A mudbank lies ahead, lurking under shallow water, and we get stuck, briefly. It is only when we steer into the tide channel, stirring up silty brown clouds in the water as we pole ourselves with the oars, that we first see the big yellow house. From its hip roof and big brick chimneys to its well-proportioned bulk, the house quietly acknowledges its eighteenth-century origins. I&#x2019;m in a time warp. <br>As we cautiously approach, rowing as quietly as we can, hulking blackish-green boxwoods suddenly loom above the corner of a porch. <i>Buxus sempervirens</i>, or common box, these shrubs look to be an astounding twelve feet tall. Is this an illusion created by looking up from such a small boat? No, it isn&#x2019;t. They&#x2019;re gigantic. We&#x2019;re used to seeing boxwoods as frilly edging around flower beds, or modest green bosses set to either side of a front door. Slow-growing boxwoods do well in this moderate climate, tempered by the surrounding waters of the Atlantic, but they seldom exceed eight feet north of the Mason-Dixon Line. As a landscape historian and a gardener, I feel that these linebacker giants must be very, very old. Boxwoods, one of the few shrubs that in optimum conditions can live for hundreds of years, are like the guardians of history. The dense evergreen foliage of specimens like these seem to hold memory in each small, shining leaf. <br>Boxwoods, seen here in a family photograph taken before 1908, have guarded the central garden path at Sylvester Manor for at least two hundred years. <br>The reflection of the house in the glassy water doesn&#x2019;t tremble. No wind. I hold my breath too, as if the building itself would disappear if the water moved. <br>My friend idles his oars. As we pull closer to shore, we see what looks like a place to land. Apparently a crude boulder wall, it has a few stone steps rising from the water. Nobody is around. Can&#x2019;t resist. I climb the steps; my friend waits, amused but concerned that I&#x2019;m going to get caught trespassing. However, he&#x2019;s used to my marauding tactics in deserted gardens. <br>Once up the steps, I see that the wall is actually a land bridge carpeted with grass. Wonderfully strange. On the far side of the bridge, another part of the inlet we&#x2019;ve ventured into continues. A track runs down from the woods we just rowed past, heading for the house. I follow it. I knock softly at the front door, then louder. I call. Still no answer, nobody home. Great. So I check out the gangling, rusty windmill and water tank on stilts near a big barn, and an old cannon facing the water, sitting on a crude wooden carriage. Where the heavy lower branches of a gigantic copper beech have reached the ground, they have taken root and sprung up into a copse surrounding the mother tree. The tree bulks almost as large as the long, elegant house that was clearly built over many generations, lying composedly in the sun on a summer afternoon. <br>On the east side of the house, away from the water, white pickets protect a rambling flower garden. The big boxwoods I glimpsed from the boat flank the garden gate. Now that I am close to them, I see they are indeed twelve feet tall, and fifteen feet broad. Inside, the garden is cut by a central path running straight and narrow through two lines of more boxwoods. The far end of the path telescopes to a distant gate, a view that seems to stretch back at least two hundred years. Grand gardens were built like this then, fenced rectangles on axis with the main house. <br>I climb back into the rowboat, stunned. This place isn&#x2019;t self-consciously &#x201c;historic&#x201d;; it&#x2019;s not restored in any sense. It has simply <i>been here</i>, waiting for time to pass. Waiting for me. <br>Suddenly we hear water moving. The Atlantic tide begins to empty itself in a thin silver coil from the inlet above the stone bridge. Twice a day, every day, for how many years? This place stands still, outside any ordinary dimension of time or space, but tide and time move through it. We row out of Gardiners Creek, moving with the tide. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Curious to find out exactly where I&#x2019;d been in the dinghy, I checked a map of the island to get my bearings, and asked the owner of the local sandwich joint if he knew who owned the place: an Andrew Fiske, and his wife, Alice. I wrote asking to meet them. I had trouble with my letter, trying out various versions of &#x201c;Who are you and what is this place?&#x201d; At last I settled on something economical and true, but pitifully inadequate to express the curiosity I felt. &#x201c;Dear Mr. and Mrs. Fiske,&#x201d; I wrote, &#x201c;I rowed into the creek below your house and could not resist walking around your lawns and garden,&#x201d; and I finished by saying I was a garden historian and would like to meet them and learn about the history of their house. Several months and three letters later, I received a reply, and an invitation to visit. <br>I pulled through the white-painted cement gates opposite Shelter Island&#x2019;s lone supermarket and rattled down the long wooded driveway, two worn sandy tracks separated by a grass ridge. Not much traffic here, that was clear. I wondered whether the couple I would meet could possibly match the magic of my waterside introduction. <br> <i>To the Staircase</i> <br>Two small figures stand under the front portico, one in a wrinkled linen jacket and open-necked checked shirt, the other in skirt and blouse, with a chintz mobcap topping the ensemble. Sensible shoes on both, and an air of the fifties about them. Pleasant greetings, a swift assessment from Andrew&#x2019;s pale blue eyes, a big lipsticked smile from Alice. As they invite me into the darkened front hall, light hits the polished brass doorknob. A large key gleams in the heavy, square lock. I step across the threshold and into a history project spanning eleven generations, three and a half centuries, and four continents. Here, where the Hamptons, jittery playground of the rich and famous, are only eight miles away, I am astonished to learn I&#x2019;m meeting a member of a family that has lived on this tranquil-seeming property in an unbroken line since 1652. <br>Alice, clearly a character and perhaps the boss, departs for the garden. Andy asks whether I&#x2019;d like to see the house. As we continue to stand in the front hall, he regales me with his romantic version of a family story passed on to him and shaped mostly during America&#x2019;s Colonial Revival, between 1876 and the twenties, by his great-grandfather Eben Norton Horsford and his youngest daughter, Cornelia Horsford. I would review and reassemble this history many times. <br>Eventually I combined the results of a decade of research into Andy&#x2019;s documents with information from oral and traditional histories; intellectual, economic, agricultural, and architectural history; and archaeology, dowsing, and dendrochronological analysis of the timbers of the house. This book offers an interpretation of the Sylvester Manor site that is more startling, more full of gaps, and more complex and paradoxical than Andy&#x2019;s tale&#x2014;and it still leaves the place and its history open to further study. The colorful Andy version rings with a certainty that my version doesn&#x2019;t possess, but I would discover many disconcerting errors and gaps in his tale. <br>His account runs like this: In 1652, the dashing Nathaniel Sylvester, son of an English merchant family, sailed north from Barbados, where his family owned sugar plantations that depended on the labor of hundreds of Africans. With him came his teenaged bride, Grizzell Brinley, daughter of Charles I&#x2019;s court auditor, Thomas Brinley. After a dramatic shipwreck, the newlyweds landed on Shelter Island, where a large and comfortable house (built previously by Nathaniel and his servants) stood ready to receive the young couple. Nathaniel and his brother Constant and two other Barbadian planters, Thomas Middleton and Thomas Rous, had bought the island from Stephen Goodyear, the deputy governor of New Haven Colony, who had bought it as a speculative venture in 1651 from the estate of the Earl of Stirling, its first English owner, for 1,600 pounds of the unrefined brown sugar known as muscovado. Andy carefully explained that even though Nathaniel and Grizzell were not Quakers themselves, a sense of noblesse oblige moved them to offer their isolated island as a sanctuary for the earliest Friends fleeing the savage persecution of Boston Puritans. The young couple invited George Fox, the Quaker founder, to visit in 1673 and preach the Inner Light. Because Grizzell&#x2019;s father, a high civil servant who served in the Royal Exchequer, had the ear and the gratitude of the king, Charles II, the persecution stopped. The Sylvesters enjoyed good relations with the Indians and respectfully purchased the island again from the local Manhansett chief, Youghco. They hobnobbed with, and married into, New England&#x2019;s ruling elite. Last but not least, Grizzell bore twelve children, eleven of whom lived to maturity, thereby begetting the long line that led to Andy Fiske. <br>Andy fast-forwards two generations to Nathaniel&#x2019;s grandson, the fashionable Brinley Sylvester, born in Newport, who inherited in 1733. To Brinley, the ramshackle eighty-year-old family mansion seemed very out of date; he tore it down and built this house. We are standing in the east parlor as Andy tells me this, a room of extraordinary beauty and strangeness. Beautiful because the proportions and the fully paneled walls are exquisite, and all the more so for being so very early Georgian high style in this now remote corner of the world, once part of a thriving maritime economy. Strange, because there are only two coats of paint on these walls, through which the silvery old wood shows in patches. The bottom coat is that acid blue-green so fashionable in the mid-eighteenth century. The top coat is a modest biscuit color, emblematic of good taste, applied sometime in the 1840s, just before wall colors turned dark and Victorian. How peculiar and lucky it is that no one put on a third coat, I think to myself. <br>On one wall hangs a dingy portrait of a solemn man with a very large nose, Andy&#x2019;s notable ancestor Ezra L&#x2019;Hommedieu, Nathaniel Sylvester&#x2019;s great-grandson, an American statesman who died in 1811. As we turn away from the painting, I am startled to see the same nose confronting me in the flesh&#x2014;on Andy&#x2019;s face. The doubling of past and present doesn&#x2019;t stop with the portrait. Andy gently coaxes me to notice that the same blue and white pearlware basket depicted in the portrait of a little girl in red over the mantel now sits safely on a shelf behind the parlor door. Despite the past, how strangely lived-in this room feels, with its big bunch of plastic daffodils, box of mah-jongg tiles, and folding card table, vintage 1950. <br>It hits me that Andy and Alice are living in a place that is hidden away from the outside world&#x2014;but in plain sight. Everything is simultaneously ghostly and absolutely present. I&#x2019;ve lost my bearings and have no idea how to deal with the vast world laid out before me. But because I&#x2019;m a landscape historian, and landscape historians always look out the window to see what&#x2019;s there, I peer through the east window. Yes, the axial garden path that marches through the giant boxwoods <i>does</i> align exactly with the view from this window, meaning there is a good chance that the builder of the house knowingly connected the two. I feel I could follow this slim lead on the ground and backward into history. We head into the library, dimmed by half-drawn blinds, where the rare histories of rail that are Andy&#x2019;s passion stand shelved beneath a sepia photograph of a fur-hatted &#x201c;Papa&#x201d; Horsford, as Professor Eben Norton Horsford, Andy&#x2019;s great-grandfather, is called by the family. The personal fortune of this self-made man gave the manor a sorely needed boost in the 1850s. I&#x2019;m told that a framed crewelwork strip hanging beside the photo came from a set of eighteenth-century bed hangings. Andy says that the bed once furnished a room on nearby Gardiners Island, a sister manor first settled in 1635 by Lion Gardiner, a Dutch-trained English fortifications engineer. A Gardiner descendant married the girl in the red dress, a Sylvester descendant. I nod. Of course. <br>The next stop is a blank wall in the front hall, or so it seems. Andy waits a beat, which allows me to see the outline of a secret jib door cut into the garlanded silk wallpaper. He then creaks open the thick panel to reveal a walk-in safe, a vault that Andy has been told could withstand the hottest flames for six hours. I can barely keep from saying that fire would probably consume this wooden house in minutes, the timbers are so old and dry. The vault ceiling is about seven feet high, and the walls&#x2014;lined with high dark chests and file cabinets&#x2014;press in on us from every side. Old trunks crowd the red-tiled floor. By the single sixty-watt bulb, I can pick out one with a curved top painted the same acid blue-green as the parlor undercoat; another is covered in hide. Thousands of documents are housed here in these trunks and many others, in drawers, and in albums in which Andy has flattened some several hundred of his most precious ones, decoding them over countless Sunday mornings. (Andy, quietly determined not to be a churchgoer like his wife, has found a convincing escape.) Other papers have not been read since the original recipients broke the wax seals, or slit the envelopes, and then bundled them up with ribbon or string for reference someday. Someday in 1690, or 1790, or 1890, or today. <br>Andy opens what he calls &#x201c;the object case.&#x201d; Each dark metal shelf is loaded&#x2014;a framed letter from Thomas Jefferson to Ezra L&#x2019;Hommedieu about &#x201c;the Hessian fly,&#x201d; a crop pest; an antique meerschaum pipe; an Indian treaty of 1654, written on both sides of the parchment paper and signed with the &#x201c;marks&#x201d; of many Indian sachems. And there are things that are counted as treasures only by those who have stashed them here: a woman&#x2019;s long, fat braid of light brown hair, a tarnished metal spirit level barely an inch long with the bubble still intact. Silver candelabra lord it over prosaic metal file cabinets. In glass-front cupboards, display dishes are heaped with brooches, strands of beads, and earrings, a stone block incised with the date 1777, a ...</p><h2>West</h2><p><b>In the sequel to the beloved high fantasy <i>East</i>, Rose sets off on a perilous journey to find her true love when he goes missing in a thrilling tale of danger, magic, adventure, and revenge<i>.</i></b><br><br> When Rose first met Charles, he was trapped in the form of a white bear.

The writing sparkles. . . . Raffaelli preserves the florid musicality of D&#x2019;Annunzio&#x2019;s original Italian, its muscular rhythm, and the precious constructions that can make Italian seem like a foreign language in his hands.

So much contemporary writing gives us sex without sensuality; D&#x2019;Annunzio revels in a finer erotic touch. . . . The real events in D&#x2019;Annunzio&#x2019;s life were too noisy to ignore, but they shouldn&#x2019;t drown out the voice of his writing. . . .

Quality education remains an elusive dream for most African American children. Historically, they have been denied schooling, subject to separate and unequal education, and forced into unsafe, unhealthy, substandard schools. In The Dreamkeepers, Gloria Ladson-Billings explores the positive signs for the future. Who are the successful teachers of African American students? What do they do? And how can we learn from them? Her portraits of eight exemplary teachers who differ in personal style and methods but share an approach to teaching that affirms and strengthens cultural identity are inspiring and full of hope. Written in three voices&#x2014;that of an African American scholar and researcher, an African American teacher, and an African American parent and active community member, this book is a mixture of scholarship and storytelling. Ladson-Billing's portraits, interwoven with personal reflections, challenge readers to envision intellectually rigorous and culturally relevant classrooms that have the power to improve the lives of not just African American students, but all children."Education, like electricity, needs a conduit, a teacher, through which to transmit its power&#x2014; i.e., the discovery and continuity of information, knowledge, wisdom, experience, and culture.

Teaching Writing in the Content Areas examines nearly 30 years of research to identify how teachers can incorporate writing instruction that helps students master the course content and improve their overall achievement. Building on the recommendations of the National Commission on Writing, authors Vicki Urquhart and Monette McIver introduce four critical issues teachers should address when they include writing in their content courses: . Creating a positive environment for the feedback and guidance students need at various stages, including prewriting, drafting, revising, and editing . Monitoring and assessing how much students are learning through their writing . Choosing computer programs that best enhance the writing process . Strengthening their knowledge of course content and their own writing skills The authors also provide 35 classroom strategies, practices, and handouts that teachers can easily use in most subject areas or grade levels. From prewriting guides and worksheets to instructional guidance and analysis, the strategies offer realistic options to help teachers tailor writing assignments and instruction to the needs of each class. Teaching Writing in the Content Areas is more than a primer for teaching the mechanics of writing; it is a research-based guide to regularly engage students in writing that pushes them to express themselves clearly, to explore new ideas, and to become critical thinkers.</p><p></p><h2>Pre-Modern East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History, Volume I: To 1800</h2><p>Written by top scholars in the field, PRE-MODERN EAST ASIA: A CULTURAL, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL HISTORY, VOLUME I: To 1800, 3E delivers a comprehensive cultural, political, economic, and intellectual history of East Asia, while focusing on the narratives and histories of China, Japan, and Korea in a larger, global context.

His book on bread is by no means medical, but rather an entertaining and instructive tour through the whole process of bread-making from growing and harvesting the wheat, to developing satisfactory yeasts, running an effective bakehouse and investigating a whole variety of recipes for breads made not only from wheat, but also other grains, potatoes and rice. The book ends with a resum� of current law relating to the sale of bread, and an appendix containing the witness statements to a parliamentary committee on baking in 1804. The literature of bread-making in Britain is by no means as full as that on the continent of Europe. Because baking was a trade craft, practised by people barely on the verge of literacy, most instructions and technical lore were transmitted by word of mouth from master to apprentice down through the years. These instructions were deemed secrets&#x2019; and the very idea of publishing them in a printed book would have been anathema. For this reason, there are surprisingly few recipes in domestic cookery books of the period, the authors reckoning that cooks would leave it to the bakers. The literature did not really kick off until the Victorian period, and only rose to a flood in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. After Edlin, the next person to tackle the subject was a trained baker in 1828; the value, therefore, of this first book is especially great, as no others exist.</p><p>Published in London in 1805, it was the work of a medical man, little known for any other books, save a couple of pamphlets on gout and sore throats and fever, which he observed in his native Uxbridge in Middlesex.</p><h2>Budgeting and Financial Management for Nonprofit Organizations: Using Money to Drive Mission Success</h2><p>In the nonprofit sector, money drives mission.

I attended my classes, but I was more interested in the horses than anything else. I was lucky because both my mother and the school&#x2019;s headmaster encouraged me to learn everything I could about animals and science, and my teachers allowed it as long as I was on time for classes and meals and took care of the horses. In addition to riding, that meant grooming, feeding, and mucking out the stalls. Summers at my aunt&#x2019;s ranch were also extremely important; I spent all my time with the cattle and horses learning everything I could about their behavior and how to communicate with them. Another influence was John C. Purves, my maternal grandfather. He was an inventor and one of the great role models in my life. When I was a child, I asked him endless questions about the world around, such as Why do the tides on the seashore go in and out?<br><br> Another reason I became a scientist, which I didn&#x2019;t figure out until I was older, is that I&#x2019;m a visual thinker. I organize the world through pictures, and my mind references words through series of visual images. If someone says &#x201c;dog,&#x201d; my mind calls up each dog I have ever seen. As I got older, I could picture how things worked in vivid visual detail and in three dimensions. It was like running a film in my head. Eventually, I could actually test run equipment in my imagination. I could see things that clearly. It&#x2019;s considered &#x201c;normal&#x201d; to use a combination of visual and verbal skills to express thoughts and ideas, but in my experience there is no &#x201c;normal.&#x201d;<br><br> When I was diagnosed with autism (as a child in the 1950s), most people didn&#x2019;t really know what it was or the different ways it affected people. Now, we say that a person is &#x201c;on the autistic spectrum,&#x201d; which can mean many things. They may have normal speech, or they may never learn to speak at all. I was a late talker, I hated being hugged or held, and I was often in my own world. I had so much difficulty sitting still that Mother used to say to me, &#x201c;Go outside and run the energy out of you!&#x201d; I also couldn&#x2019;t stand sudden sounds or any clothes that were too scratchy, and I would become very agitated when my world was changed in any little way. Others rock back and forth all the time or need to spin themselves around and can&#x2019;t pay attention. Many can be socially awkward and unable to make eye contact, yet can have successful careers in tech companies, industrial design, the arts, or a job that requires attention to detail. Some develop special skills at a very advanced level, often in the areas of mathematics, art, computers, or music. Some great scientists and inventors were probably on the autism spectrum.<br><br> Autism is not &#x201c;one size fits all.&#x201d; The more we learn about &#x201c;the spectrum&#x201d; (the range of abilities and deficits an autistic person may have), the more we will understand different kinds of minds and how important different kinds of thinkers are&#x2014;especially where creativity, innovation, and invention are concerned. I like to think of myself and other people who are different kinds of thinkers on a human spectrum. Though our brains may work in different ways, there is no limit to the kinds of contributions we can make.<br><br> I got teased a lot in school because my social skills weren&#x2019;t all that great. I knew I didn&#x2019;t fit in, but I didn&#x2019;t know why. The kids called me &#x201c;tape recorder&#x201d; because I repeated things over and over in a kind of monotone voice. I cared more about working on science projects and making fancy horse bridles than about the high school dance. Kids still get teased today for differences. Today, I would probably be called a nerd or a geek. Though it&#x2019;s also true that nerds and geeks tend to win Nobel Prizes and run Silicon Valley.<br><br> Teachers and parents worry about the quirky kid who draws all day or the one who cares only about insects. They want kids to be well-rounded, but those single-minded kids may grow up to create and do incredible things if we encourage them to pursue their interests. At least that&#x2019;s what happened with me. My love of horses and cattle as a teen became the basis of my career as an animal scientist. No question. However, the main reason I also became an inventor is simple: Ever since I was a child, I&#x2019;ve always loved making things and working with my hands. If one of my projects failed, I would experiment for many hours until I got it to work.<br><br> When I was young, my mother let me use every kind of material from around the house to create my experiments, from her old clothes and scarves to the cardboard inside my father&#x2019;s shirts when they came back from the cleaners. That cardboard was treasure! I could make a million things with it: building blocks that became forts, dioramas, models, and jumping jacks. I loved taking things apart and putting them back together, or making new inventions out of the pieces. You&#x2019;ll find lots of these projects in this book, but I also encourage you to experiment and design your own. Remember: instructions are only guidelines. Sometimes my students will come to me very upset because they followed the directions to an experiment perfectly, but it didn&#x2019;t produce the desired result. I tell them the same thing: you have to experiment with the experiment!<br> If I had to boil this book down, my message would be this: Make Things.<br><br> &#x25b7; &#x25b7; &#x25b7;<br><br> The future holds many crucial challenges such as understanding the impact of climate change, curing diseases, and ending hunger. We need all kinds of minds if we are going to figure how to adapt. If we lose the ability to make things, we will lose a whole lot more. We need people who can cast iron and chemists who can create new materials that are lighter and stronger than metal. We need new storytellers, filmmakers, musicians, and artists. And we need new technologies to explore the future, including a deeper and more complex understanding of the earth and the ocean and the galaxies.<br><br> There is no better way to start than by making things of your own design. All the projects I made when I was young contributed to the inventions I&#x2019;ve made throughout my life. And they have given my life meaning. I hope these projects and the ones you create will do the same for you.</p><h2>Leadership as an Identity: The Four Traits of Those Who Wield Lasting Influence</h2><p><b>Ask yourself this question: What type of character qualifies the people God chooses&nbsp;to use?<br><br></b>The question itself assumes an atypical answer, simply because it leaves out so much. To ask only about one's character seems inadequate when defining a leader. We surely need to ask about character, but also about personality, communication skills, IQ, education, previous experience, and more... don't we?<br><br>Crawford Loritts disagrees. He answers the question with four simple words: Brokenness, communion, servanthood, and obedience.<br><br>These four traits form the framework for <i>Leadership as an Identity</i>. By examining each trait, Loritts undermines many pervasive assumptions about leadership that are unbiblical.<br><br>According to Loritts, God doesn't look for leaders like the world does. He looks for disciples.<br></p><p><b>CRAWFORD LORITTS</b> (Philadelphia Biblical University; Biola University) is the senior pastor of Fellowship Bible Church in Roswell, Georgia.

Long the bane of second-year Latin students thrust into a rhetoric of sweeping, seemingly endless sentences full of difficult verb forms and obscure words, Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i> finds a helpful translator in Robert Fitzgerald, who turns the lines into beautiful, accessible American English. Full of betrayal, heartache, seduction, elation, and violence, the <i>Aeneid</i> is the great founding epic of the Roman empire. Its pages sing of the Roman vision of self, the Roman ideal of what it meant to be a citizen of the world's greatest power. The epic's force carries across the centuries, and remains essential reading.This book is the equal of its great Homeric predecessors, The Iliad and The Odyssey, in dramatic and narrative power, and it surpasses them in the intense sympathy which makes events such as the passion and destruction of Dido and the fall of Turnus among the most memorable in literature.</p><h2>The Freud Reader</h2><p>Freudian thought permeates many aspects of 20th-century life, and to understand Freud is to explore not only his scientific papers but also his writings on art, literature, politics, religion and culture. Containing 51 texts which span Freud&#39;s entire career, from early case histories, through his work on dreams and essays on sexuality, and on to his late writings (including &#34;Civilisation and Its Discontents&#34;), this book brings together his ideas as a scientist, humanist, doctor and philosopher. Introductions to the texts are provided by Peter Gay, who has also written a general introduction which places the man and his work in the context of his time and culture.</p><p>Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) is one of the twentieth century's greatest minds and the founder of the psychoanalytic school of psychology. His many works include The Ego and the Id; An Outline of Psycho-Analysis; Inhibitions; Symptoms and Anxiety; New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis; Civilization and Its Discontent, and others.<br><br>Peter Gay (1923&#x2015;2015) was the author of more than twenty-five books, including the National Book Award winner The Enlightenment, the best-selling Weimar Culture, and the widely translated Freud: A Life for Our Time.Author of numerous books on Freud, including a highly regarded biography ( Freud, LJ 7/88), Gay offers the general reader a comprehensive survey of Freud's psychoanalytical, political, and philosophical writings. Preceded by a meaty introduction that emphasizes Freud's commitment to science and reason, this single-volume work includes some 50 of Freud's texts, organized chronologically with headnotes. The selections range from case studies and theoretical discussions about dreams, anxiety, and anal eroticism to essays on lay analysis and religion as humankind's obsessional neurosis. Read sequentially, they allow readers to trace Freud's conceptual shift from a topographic theory of the mind to his structural theory of drives.

A great book, in a great historical tradition." Commentary<br><br>The 14th century gives us back two contradictory images: a glittering time of crusades and castles, cathedrals and chivalry, and a dark time of ferocity and spiritual agony, a world plunged into a chaos of war, fear and the Plague. Barbara Tuchman anatomizes the century, revealing both the great rhythms of history and the grain and texture of domestic life as it was lived.</p><p>In this sweeping historical narrative, Barbara Tuchman writes of the cataclysmic 14th century, when the energies of medieval Europe were devoted to fighting internecine wars and warding off the plague. Some medieval thinkers viewed these disasters as divine punishment for mortal wrongs; others, more practically, viewed them as opportunities to accumulate wealth and power. One of the latter, whose life informs much of Tuchman&#39;s book, was the French nobleman Enguerrand de Coucy, who enjoyed the opulence and elegance of the courtly tradition while ruthlessly exploiting the peasants under his thrall. Tuchman looks into such events as the Hundred Years War, the collapse of the medieval church, and the rise of various heresies, pogroms, and other events that caused medieval Europeans to wonder what they had done to deserve such horrors.Anyone who has read THE GUNS OF AUGUST or STILWELL AND THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE IN CHINA, knows that Barbara Tuchman was one of the most gifted American writers of this century. Her subject was history, but her profiles of great men and great events are drawn with such power that reading Tuchman becomes a riveting experience<br><br>In A DISTANT MIRROR, Barbara Tuchman illuminates the Dark Ages. Her description of medieval daily life, the role of the church, the influence of the Great Plagues, and the social and political conventions that make this period of history so engrossing, are carefully woven into an integrated narrative that sweeps the reader along.<br><br> I am a particular devotee of medieval and pre Renaissance music, so Barbara Tuchman's brilliant analysis of this period has special meaning for me - and I hope for many others.<br><br>George Davidson, Director of Production, The Ballantine Publishing Group</p><h2>Principles of Environmental Geochemistry</h2><p>The basic philosophy of PRINCIPLES OF ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY is to present chemical principles that are essential for understanding environmental problems and then show how these principles can be applied to real-world problems. The latter goal is achieved by including a number of case studies in each chapter. The book is process oriented, emphasizing the tools needed to understand environmental problems, and is not a recitation of environmental problems and issues. Chemistry topics are developed from first principles and the focus is on those principles that are most useful in the environmental field. This text is more accessible than the larger, higher-level environmental geochemistry books on the market that assume familiarity with chemical and quantitative background material. The topical coverage is broad, including extensive material on the isotopic and mineralogical aspects of environmental issues and a significant chapter on the atmosphere. Case studies are integrated throughout to show the application of the various principles to real-world problems, and many of the very extensive set of end-of-chapter problems encourage students to become familiar with the scientific literature on this subject.</p><p>Nelson Eby is Professor of Geosciences at the University of Massachusetts � Lowell, where he teaches earth and environmental systems, environmental geochemistry, igneous and metamorphic petrology, structural geology, sedimentation and stratigraphy, advanced geochemistry, applied geophysics, and marine geology. He has published over 70 papers dealing with geochemistry and igneous petrology and his current research encompasses geological problems on four continents. He is a past associate editor of the Canadian Mineralogist and the Journal of African Earth Sciences."I will definitely adopt this textbook. As far as I am concerned, this is an absolute winner." "Unlike many other textbooks, THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN FOR STUDENTS." "This book is clearer and more student-friendly than any other book on environmental geochemistry that I am aware of."<br><br>"I will adopt this book as my textbook because it provides the students with the concepts and the theory as well as the worked-out examples.""This is a giant whopper of a textbook, and I love it. It is one of the most comprehensive treatises of environmental geochemistry available, with a thorough mix of fundamental derivations, worked-out examples, and chemical rigor."<br><br>"I would definitely consider adopting this text for our undergraduate Environmental Chemistry course because the exposure to geochemistry principles is well served."</p><h2>Media &amp; Culture: Mass Communication in a Digital Age</h2><p><p>Mass media have taken the digital turn: they have made the transition from the analog past into our digital future.

The new understandings were made possible thanks to Albert Hofmann s discovery of LSD the microscope and telescope of the human psyche as well as other psychedelic substances. This comprehensive work is a tour de force through the worlds of psychology and psychotherapy, Holotropic Breathwork, maps of the psyche, birth, sex, and death, psychospiritual rebirth, the roots of trauma, spiritual emergency and transpersonal experiences, karma and reincarnation, higher creativity, great art, and archetypes. Written in his late eighties, at the height of his magnificent career, The Way of the Psychonaut is possibly Grof s greatest contribution. The commanding breadth and depth of his knowledge is astounding, the tone of his writing easy and accessible, and his narratives brightened with amusing anecdotes, intriguing personal accounts, and brilliant case studies. Grof reviews the history of depth psychotherapy, the important revisions that are needed to make it more effective, and why the inner quest is such an essential pursuit. The second section of this encyclopedia focuses on the observations and experiences from the research of holotropic states that indicate an urgent need for a radical revision of some basic assumptions of mainstream psychiatry and psychology.</p><p>Stanislav Grof, M.D., Ph.D., is a psychiatrist with over sixty years of research experience in non-ordinary states of consciousness and one of the founders and chief theoreticians of transpersonal psychology. He was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, where he also received his scientific training: an M.D. degree from the Charles University School of Medicine and a Ph.D. degree (Doctor of Philosophy in Medicine) from the Czechoslovakian Academy of Sciences. Dr. Grof s early research in the clinical uses of psychedelic substances was conducted at the Psychiatric Research Institute in Prague, where he was principal investigator of a program that systematically explored the heuristic and therapeutic potential of LSD and other psychedelic substances. In 1967 he was invited as Clinical and Research Fellow to the Johns Hopkins University and the Research Unit of Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore, MD. In 1969, he became Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University and continued his research as Chief of Psychiatric Research at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center in Catonsville, MD. In 1973 Dr. Grof was invited to the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California, where he developed, with his late wife Christina Grof, Holotropic Breathwork, an innovative form of experiential psychotherapy that is now being used worldwide. Dr. Grof is the founder of the International Transpersonal Association (ITA) and for several decades served as its president. In 1993 he received an Honorary Award from the Association for Transpersonal Psychology (ATP) for major contributions to and development of the field of transpersonal psychology, given at the occasion of the 25th Anniversary Convocation held in Asilomar, California. In 2007, he received the prestigious VISION 97 lifetime achievement award from the Foundation of Dagmar and V�clav Havel in Prague, Czechoslovakia. In 2010, he received also the Thomas R. Verny Award from the Association for Pre- and Perinatal Psychology and Health (APPPAH) for his pivotal contributions to this field. Among Dr. Grof s publications are over 150 articles in professional journals and the books LSD: Gateway to the Numinous; Beyond the Brain; LSD Psychotherapy; The Cosmic Game; Psychology of the Future; The Ultimate Journey; When the Impossible Happens; Books of the Dead; Healing Our Deepest Wounds; Modern Consciousness Research and the Understanding of Art; The Stormy Search for the Self; Spiritual Emergency; and Holotropic Breathwork (the last three with Christina Grof). These books have been translated into twenty-three languages.I consider Stanislav Grof to be a far-out eclectic involved in transpersonal psychology, psychedelics, and scientific psychiatry as well as a very dear friend who has made significant contributions with his work. --Ram Dass<br><br>If you have ever wondered what it would have been like to sit down and talk with Freud, Jung, or William James, you now have the opportunity to read the current, living works of one of the leading psychological theorists in modern history. Stanislav Grof serves as our guide through the territory of our own consciousness from our core essence to the furthest, most extraordinary frontiers. Scholarly, radical, historic, and original, this book is written in a completely accessible way each page holds the potential to stretch your mind just that little bit more. --Cassandra Vieten, Ph.D.<br><br>Future historians will describe the emergence of psychedelic compounds and plants in the mid-1960s as an event that radically changed psychology, psychiatry, and psychotherapy. It also sent shockwaves through Western culture, transforming lifestyles, worldviews, the arts, theoretical physics, technology, and the computer industry. If you think this is an exaggeration, read The Way of the Psychonaut, Stanislav Grof s well-crafted and beautifully written account of an era that may save humanity in spite of itself. --Stanley Krippner, Ph.D.</p><h2>All Clear 1: Listening and Speaking, 2nd Edition</h2><p>All Clear teaches students to recognize and produce the high-frequency idioms, phrases, and contemporary expressions needed in a range of conversational situations.

What chance did I have, going into the world of British theatreDavid Suchet has been a stalwart of British stage and screen for fifty years. From Shakespeare to Oscar Wilde, Freud to Poirot, Edward Teller to Doctor Who, Harold Pinter to Terence Rattigan, Questions of Faith to Decline and Fall, right up to 2019&#39;s The Price, David has done it all. Throughout this spectacular career, David has never been without a camera, enabling him to vividly document his life in photographs. Seamlessly combining photo and memoir, Behind the Lens is the story of David&#39;s remarkable life, showcasing his wonderfully evocative photographs and accompanied by his insightful and engaging commentary.In Behind the Lens, David discusses his London upbringing and love of the city, his Jewish roots and how they have influenced his career, the importance of his faith, how he really feels about fame, his love of photography and music, and his processes as an actor. He looks back on his fifty-year career, including reflections on how the industry has changed, his personal highs and lows, and how he wants to be remembered. And, of course, life after Poirot and why he&#39;s still grieving for the eccentric Belgian detective.

Perhaps his oddest authorial role was as a monthly contributor between 1944 and 1949 to the <i>Illinois Dental Journal</i>, an obscure trade publication for dentists, where writing as Philip Sparrow he produced a series of charming, richly allusive, and often quirky essays on a wildly eclectic assortment of topics.<br> <br> In <i>Philip Sparrow Tells All</i>, Jeremy Mulderig has collected thirty of these engaging but forgotten columns, prefacing them with revealing introductions that relate the essays to people and events in Steward&#x2019;s life and to the intellectual and cultural contexts in which he wrote during the 1940s. In these essays we encounter such famous friends of Steward as Gertrude Stein, Andr� Gide, and Thornton Wilder. We hear of his stint as a holiday sales clerk at Marshall Field&#x2019;s (where he met and seduced fellow employee Rock Hudson), of his roles as an opera and ballet extra in hilariously shoddy costumes, of his hoarding tendencies, his disappointment with the drabness of men&#x2019;s fashions, and his dread of turning forty. We go along with him to a bodybuilding competition and a pet cemetery, and together we wander the boulevards of Paris and the alleys of Algiers. Throughout, Mulderig&#x2019;s entertaining annotations explain the essays&#x2019; wide-ranging allusions and also highlight their gay subtext, which constituted a kind of private game that Steward played with his mostly oblivious audience of Midwestern dentists.<br> <br> The first collection of any of Samuel Steward&#x2019;s writings to be republished since his death in 1993, <i>Philip Sparrow Tells All</i> makes these lost essays available to a broad readership that Steward imagined but never actually enjoyed when he wrote them. In doing so, it takes a major step toward documenting his important place in twentieth-century gay literature and history.</p></p><p><b>Samuel Steward</b> taught at both Loyola University and DePaul University in Chicago and ran a famous tattoo parlor on the city&#x2019;s south side. His books include <i>Dear Sammy: Letters from Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas</i>, <i>Bad Boys and Tough Tattoos</i>, and the Phil Andros series of erotic novels. <b>Jeremy Mulderig</b> is Vincent de Paul Associate Professor of English, Emeritus, at DePaul University in Chicago.&#x201c;This remarkable collection assembles Steward&#x2019;s essays for an unlikely venue: the <i>Illinois Dental Journal</i>. Steward, a once-neglected figure in queer history, palled around with Gertrude Stein, kept a &#x2018;stud file&#x2019; of his sexual conquests, and ran a successful tattoo parlor catering to sailors. In 1944, he was asked by his dentist, the journal&#x2019;s editor, to write a column providing a &#x2018;worm&#x2019;s-eye view&#x2019; of dentistry. The essays that followed, under the pen name Philip Sparrow, were elegantly constructed, bitingly funny, and likely to be utterly baffling to the original readership&#x2014;particularly the coded gay references.&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly, starred review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;I suspected, for a moment, that <i>Philip Sparrow Tells All</i> was a prank, either by the University of Chicago Press or <i>on</i> it. The essays of a tattoo artist recovered from 70-year-old issues of the <i>Illinois Dental Journal</i>? Come on. . . . With the measure of safety provided by a pseudonym&#x2014;and also by the less-than-mass circulation of the <i>Illinois Dental Journal</i>&#x2014;Steward experimented with the comic, personal and confessional modes of the casual essay in ways that might have been difficult to risk otherwise.&#x201d; (<i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Talent plus obscurity in a research subject mix to make an irresistible cocktail for almost any scholar. Samuel Steward (1909-1993), also known by his pen name and alter ego &#x2018;Philip Sparrow,&#x2019; possesses both in intoxicating quantities, making it easy to see why editor Jeremy Mulderig has worked so hard to bring this figure further into the light in <i>Philip Sparrow Tells All: Lost Essays by Samuel Steward, Writer, Professor, Tattoo Artist</i>. . . . The collection is well worth reading, both for the quality of writing in the essays themselves and for the importance of Steward as a figure who stands as a key rediscovery for Chicago&#x2019;s history in particular and for LGBTQ history in general.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;At first blush, these essays may seem like gay esoterica, exemplary bits of camp. But they&#x2019;re more than that. Mr. Mulderig saw fit to gather and annotate them because they are very good&#x2014;a curious mix of frivolity and erudition, peacockery and restraint. They&#x2019;re a lost chronicle from a one-of-a-kind writer who spent five years hiding in plain sight. . . . Seductive and entertaining.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;How wonderful that Mulderig has reclaimed these lost gems of gay writing. The personal essays in this collection are written from a queer perspective at a time when censorship and homophobia were rampant. It is all the more remarkable considering they were published in the obscure <i>Illinois Dental Journal</i> between the years of 1944 and 1949. . . . Be it a sensitive prophecy of the difficulties soldiers will have reintegrating into American society after World War II or a humorous take on male fashion, Steward&#x2019;s range of subject matter is impressive.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Lambda Literary</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A must-read for anyone interested in LGBT history.&#x201d; (<i>Daily Kos</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Fans of Samuel Steward will pounce upon <i>Phil Sparrow Tells All</i>, which brings forth from near-total obscurity 30 of the 50 essays Steward wrote between 1944-49 for, get this, the <i>Illinois Dental Journal. . . . </i>Each essay is entertainingly introduced by editor Mulderig, an Emeritus Professor of English at the DePaul University. As Steward plays peek-a-boo with the reader, Mulderig annotates the gay subtext. Between the editor and the author, erudition is all over the place. All told, these essays reconfirm Steward's important place in 20th-century gay literature.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Bay Area Reporter</i>)</p><h2>The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters</h2><p>In addition to being short-listed for the Guardian First Book Award upon publication in 2000, Frances Stonor Saunders's <i>The Cultural Cold War</i> was met with the kind of attention reserved for books that directly hit a cultural nerve. Impassioned reviews and features in major publications such as the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> have consistently praised Saunders's detailed knowledge of the CIA's covert operations. <i>The Cultural Cold War</i> presents for the first time shocking evidence of cultural manipulation during the Cold War. This "impressively detailed" (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>) book draws together newly declassified documents and exclusive interviews to expose the CIA's astonishing campaign wherein some of the most vocal exponents of intellectual freedom became instruments of the American government. Those involved included George Orwell, Bertrand Russell, Jean-Paul Sartre, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and Gloria Steinem. The result is "a tale of intrigue and betrayal, with scene after scene as thrilling as any in a John Le Carre novel" (<i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>).8 pages of black-and-white photographs.</p><p>It is well known that the CIA funded right-wing intellectuals after World War II; fewer know that it also courted individuals from the center and the left in an effort to turn the intelligentsia away from communism and toward an acceptance of "the American way." Frances Stonor Saunders sifts through the history of the covert Congress for Cultural Freedom in <i>The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters</i>. The book centers on the career of Michael Josselson, the principal intellectual figure in the operation, and his eventual betrayal by people who scapegoated him. Sanders demonstrates that, in the early days, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the emergent CIA were less dominated by the far right than they later became, and that the idea of helping out progressive moderates--rather than being Machiavellian--actually appealed to the men at the top.<p> Many intellectuals were still drawn to Stalin's Russia. Saunders superbly traces the crisis of conscience that McCarthyism and its associated book-burning caused, and the subsequent rise of more moderate ideals. This exhaustive account, despite neglecting some important side issues, is an essential book. <i>--Roz Kaveney, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><b>Frances Stonor Saunders</b> has worked as an independent film producer on such documentaries as <i>Hidden Hands: A Different History of Modernism</i>. She is an arts editor at the <i>New Statesman</i> in London.</p><h2>Point Counter Point (British Literature)</h2><p>One of Huxley&#39;s masterpieces one of the Modern Library&#39;s &#34;100 Best Works of the Century.&#34;</p><p>When it was published in 1928, <i>Point Counter Point</i> no doubt shocked its readers with frank depictions of infidelity, sexuality, and the highbrow high jinks of Aldous Huxley's arty characters. What's truly remarkable, however, is how his novel continues to shock today. True, we may hardly lift an eyebrow at poor Marjorie Carling leaving her husband to live in sin with--and get pregnant by--her lover Walter Bidlake. And the sexual exploits of Lady Edward Tantamount or her daughter, Lucy, seem quite in keeping with the behavior expected of such exalted persons by readers inured to the exploits of the British Royals. If the varieties of sexual experience on display in Huxley's novel seem tame by current standards, his clear-eyed dissection of the motives behind them are thrillingly fresh--and his commentaries on everything from politics to ecology sometimes chillingly prescient. Take for example, the wisdom of amateur biologist Lord Edward Tantamount on the subject of non-renewable resources: <blockquote> "No doubt," he said, "you think you can make good the loss with phosphate rocks. But what'll you do when the deposits are exhausted?" He poked Everard in the shirt front. "What then? Only two hundred years and they'll be finished. You think we're being progressive because we're living on our capital Phosphates, coal, petroleum, nitre--squander them all. That's your policy. And meanwhile you go round trying to make our flesh creep with talk about revolutions." </blockquote> When his interlocutor, the fascist politician Everard Webley, demands to know whether Lord Edward <i>wants</i> a revolution, Tantamount first asks whether such an event would reduce the population and check production and then, when assured it would, he responds, "'Then certainly I want a revolution.' The Old Man thought in terms of geology and was not afraid of logical conclusions." <p> Huxley fills his novel with a multitude of characters, from the obscenely wealthy Tantamounts to the priapic painter John Bidlake, his children Walter and Elinor, and their respective mates, Marjorie Carling and Philip Quarles. There is also the venomous Maurice Spandrell, the revolutionary Illidge, the unctuous Burlap, and the happily married (a rarity in this novel) Mark and Mary Rampion, who are the book's moral center--theirs is the one relationship that combines reason and passion in proper measure. They are purportedly in part based on well-known figures of the time such as D.H. Lawrence and Katherine Mansfield. Love, loss, infidelity, and murder are the subjects under discussion as Huxley juxtaposes one point of view against its opposite, and mixes in a healthy dollop of science, politics, religion, and art, as well. <i>Point Counter Point</i> is an intelligent novel about the intellectual world, and one that bears up gracefully under the test of time. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Aldous Huxley&#39;s lifelong concern with the dichotomy between passion and reason finds its fullest expression both thematically and formally in his masterpiece Point Counter Point. By presenting a vision of life in which diverse aspects of experience are observed simultaneously, Huxley characterizes the symptoms of &#34;the disease of modern man&#34; in the manner of a composer - themes and characters are repeated, altered slightly, and played off one another in a tone that is at once critical and sympathetic. First published in 1928, Huxley&#39;s satiric view of intellectual life in the &#39;20s is populated with characters based on such celebrities of the time as D.H. Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield, Sir Oswald Mosley, Nancy Cunard, and John Middleton Murray, as well as Huxley himself. A major work of the 20th century and a monument of literary modernism, this edition includes an introduction by acclaimed novelist Nicholas Mosley (author of Hopeful Monsters and the son of Sir Oswald Mosley). Along with Brave New World (written a few years later), Point Counter Point is Huxley&#39;s most concentrated attack on the scientific attitude and its effect on modern culture.</p><h2>Trigonometry: A Unit Circle Approach</h2><p>Mike Sullivan&#x2019;s time-tested approach focuses students on the fundamental skills they need for the course: preparing for class, practicing with homework, and reviewing the concepts.

With pros and cons on either side of a heated, ongoing debate, no definitive conclusions have emerged. The purpose of this book is to furnish you, the concerned Christian, with a clear and thorough presentation of the two primary views on women in ministry so you can better understand each one&#x2019;s strengths, weaknesses, and complexities. <br><br>Each view--egalitarian (equal ministerial opportunity for both sexes) and complementarian (ministry roles differentiated by gender)--is represented by a male and a female contributor. The writers all offer thoroughly qualified insights based on careful biblical scholarship and personal experience. At the end of each of the four essays, a brief question-and-answer section provides further clarification. The general editors provide commentary at the conclusion of both hierarchical and egalitarian sections, and in the final appendix editor Craig L. Blomberg supplies thought-provoking insights into how the apostle Paul treats gender roles in his writings.<br><br>By furnishing you with current perspectives from both sides of this controversy, Two Views on Women in Ministry helps you draw and support your own informed conclusions.</p><p>James R. Beck is professor of counseling at Denver Seminary and the author of many books, including Jesus and Personality Theory: Exploring the Five Factor Model. The essays are contributed by Thomas R. Schreiner, Linda L. Belleville, Craig S. Keener, and Craig L. Blomberg.&#x201c;In light of the massive literature already available on the topic, why are we publishing another book on gender roles in ministry? First, the evangelical church has not yet arrived at a clear-cut consensus in the debate. The relevant theological, biblical, and exegetical issues are all very much still open for examination. This should not cause surprise; throughout its history the church has repeatedly faced challenging issues that required rigorous and extensive debate. Already within the pages of the New Testament, the first apostolic council was convened (see Acts 15:1-29) to determine if circumcision, and thus the keeping of the entire Mosaic Law, was a prerequisite for salvation. Although a preliminary agreement was reached, steering a balanced course between Judaizers on the one hand and antinomians on the other continues to be a difficult problem throughout the subsequent New Testament epistles (for example, Galatians, 2 Corinthians 10-13, Philippians 3, 1 Timothy 1, and 2 Peter 2) and remains with us in many forms today....&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Second, there is an acute need for a new (or renewed) commitment to and irenic spirit in this debate. Emotions understandably run high when one discusses whether or not (normally) unchangeable characteristics bequeathed to a person at birth dictate what roles this person can play in ministry. A generation ago it was more common than today for conservative evangelicals to stress the belief that theological decision-making must be founded on the Bible alone, apart from human experience. But some of the early scholarly publications on gender roles in home and church developed a pattern of appealing to personal experiences an unavoidable factor in the positions and attitudes one adopts in this debate. At the popular level, countless Christians have admitted that is was largely their upbringing, their tradition, and their positive or negative experiences with women in ministry, including at the highest levels of leadership, that shaped their views. At the scholarly level, it is far less unusual today to see evangelicals arguing for existential viability as a key criterion for theological decision making, even as scriptural exegesis remains primary....&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Third, an enormous amount of scholarship has appeared in the last decade on our topic. Much of this material is accessible only to specialists; this volume hopes to make it available to a wider audience. In the 1980s, two books following formats similar to ours provided precisely such comparative studies in gender roles, but in rereading them we are struck by how much has occurred in recent years and how the debates have taken significantly different turns and key points....&#x201d;</p><h2>New Testament Greek for Beginners</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This book is intended primarily for learners who are beginning the study of the Greek Testament either without any previous acquaintance with the Greek language or with an acquaintance so imperfect that a renewed course of elementary instruction is needed. <b> </b> This revision, over seventy-five years since the first edition was published, retains much of the character and organization of the first edition while accommodating readers today who lack an understanding of Latin and grammar necessary for fully comprehending the original edition. <b> </b> For an introduction to the Greek Testament. </p></p><p>This textbook is intended primarily for students who are beginning the study of the Greek Testament either without any previous acquaintance with the Greek language or with an acquaintance so imperfect that a renewed course of elementary instruction is needed.<p> <b>J.

Today, a number of these sturdy, beautifully proportioned barns and bridges are still standing &#x2014; monuments to the skill and keen eye of their original builders. This lovingly written book, accompanied by more than 75 of the author's own sketches, provides a reliable record of those vanishing forms of architecture. Accurate line drawings depict a variety of barns, such as those in Maine, attached to houses; an "open" log barn in Virginia, and a "top hat" barn in North Carolina. Covered bridges &#x2014; like barns, built for soundness and endurance &#x2014; are also illustrated, among them a saltbox structure in New England, a bridge with a pedestrian walkway in rural New York State, and a 10-span-long bridge at Clark's Ferry, Pennsylvania. Possessing a deep feeling for what might be called the Age of Wood, the author writes with "warmth and astonishing comprehension." &#x2014; <i>New York Herald Tribune Book Review.</i> Americana enthusiasts and lovers of these traditional symbols of early American life will delight in this priceless tribute to a bygone era.

All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art.

Since the third edition was published in 2010, much has happened: several key Supreme Court cases have been decided, we've seen sensational criminal trials, and the legal system has had to account for the latest developments in Internet law.<br><br>This fully updated fourth edition of <em>Law 101 </em>accounts for all this and more, as Feinman once again provides a clear introduction to American law. The book covers all the main subjects taught in the first year of law school, and discusses every facet of the American legal tradition, including constitutional law, the litigation process, and criminal, property, and contracts law. <br><br>To accomplish this, Feinman brings in the most noteworthy, infamous, and often outrageous examples and cases. We learn about the case involving scalding coffee that cost McDonald's half a million dollars, the murder trial in Victorian London that gave us the legal definition of insanity, and the epochal decision of <em>Marbury vs. Madison</em> that gave the Supreme Court the power to declare state and federal law unconstitutional. A key to learning about the law is learning legal vocabulary, and Feinman helps by clarifying terms like "due process" and "equal protection," as well as by drawing distinctions between terms like "murder" and "manslaughter."<br><br>Above all, though, is that Feinman reveals to readers of all kinds that despite its complexities and quirks, the law is can be understood by everyone. Perfect for students contemplating law school, journalists covering legislature, or even casual fans of "court-television" shows, <em>Law 101</em> is a clear and accessible introduction to the American legal system.<br><br><strong></strong><strong><em>New to this edition:</em></strong><br>Featured analysis of:<br>-the Obamacare case<br>-Citizens United<br>-the DOMA decision<br>-the Trayvon Martin case<br><br>As well as recent legal developments pertaining to:<br>-online contracting<br>-mortgages<br>-police investigations<br>-criminal sentencing</p><p><br><strong>Jay M. Feinman</strong> is Distinguished Professor of Law at Rutgers University School of Law. He is the author of six books, including<em> Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims</em> <em>and</em> <em>What You Can Do About It.</em><br><br><strong>Praise for the previous editions: </strong><p></p><br>"An engaging introduction to just about every aspect of law." --<em>The American Lawyer</em><p></p><br>"All the benefits of that first year of law school without the tedium, the terror, and the sleep deprivation...These legal lessons are presented in a style nearly always engaging and very often humorous." --<em>Jurist</em><p></p><br>"An entertaining and informative introduction to the law...For journalists, those interested in the law, and fans of television law dramas, this book should be required reading." --<em>Library Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"A layperson's introduction to the legal subjects that assault every first-year law student. From constitutional law to contracts to Dickensian procedures that guide civil suites, the book gives an approachable overview of the cases and concepts that combine to form our legal system." --<em>Newark</em> <em>Star-Ledger</em><p></p><br>"Though a book is aimed at laypersons, it offers a good refresher course to update legal practitioners and paraprofessionals in areas where they do not specialize. A good read overall for those interested in the law." --<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"<em>Law 101</em> attempts to teach you how to think like a lawyer--without requiring that you dedicate three years and tens of thousands of dollars to the task. The result? A practical book that is also a pleasure to read." --<em>The Trenton Times</em><p></p><br>"This basic text offers nonlawyers a concise, accessible overview of topics typically introduced in the first year of law school. Feinman, a law professor at Rutgers, cites seminal cases to highlight key concepts in the fields of constitutional law, civil procedure, torts, contracts, property, criminal law and criminal procedure. He does not minimize the actual complexity of these subjects, conceding variously that contract law has "tormented the most students," property law "most irritates students," conflicts of law "tortures students" and civil procedure is "the most alien." Nevertheless, he distinguishes his book from the various how-to-be-your-own-lawyer manuals on the market: 'This one is fun to read.' ...But many readers, particularly those contemplating law school, will find this a painless introduction to American legal theory and practice." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em> (Praise for the Second Edition)<p></p><br>"Many readers, particularly those contemplating law school, will find this a painless introduction to American legal theory and practice." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Feinman's style makes for easy reading, and <em>Law101</em> is chock full of analyses, anecdotes, examples, questions, and legal reasoning set out in lay terms. Overall, the book provides an excellent explanation of what American law is, and it frequently suggests ways in which it might be improved." --<em>The</em> <em>Federal Lawyer</em><p></p><br>"Academic law libraries and law libraries serving the public, academic libraries serving undergraduate students, and public libraries will find this book a good addition to their collections. This book is also a good read for students thinking of attending law school and for those persons who have been away from the practice of law but are interested in getting reacquainted with its basics." -Alicia G. Jones, Reference Librarian, Lesar Law Library, Southern Illinois University School of Law, <em>Law Library Journal</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Seeing Through Statistics, 3rd Edition</h2><p>This third edition of Jessica Utts&#39; popular book develops statistical literacy and critical thinking through real-world applications, with an emphasis on ideas, not calculations.

For ease of identification, the plants are arranged by flower color or growth form, providing a convenient way to distinguish a great majority of plants in any given woodland. Generous treatment is given to all major vascular plant groups of the forest, such as wildflowers, ferns, shrubs, trees, grasses, and sedges. Michael A. Homoya not only helps with identification, but also offers information on a plant&#x2019;s habitat, flowering period, familial relationships, biology, and connections to Indiana. For the garden enthusiast and habitat restorer, there is a section on landscaping and natural community restoration using native forest plants. </p><p>A portion of the proceeds from each sale of this book go to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for land protection and stewardship.</p></p><p><p>Michael A.

Shortly thereafter he wrote a sequel, <em>Twenty Years After</em>, that resumed the adventures of his swashbuckling heroes.<br><br> Later, toward the end of his career, Dumas wrote <em>The Red Sphinx</em>, another direct sequel to <em>The Three Musketeers</em> that begins, not twenty years later, but a mere twenty days afterward. <em>The Red Sphinx</em> picks up right where the <em>The Three Musketeers</em> left off, continuing the stories of Cardinal Richelieu, Queen Anne, and King Louis XIII&#x2015;and introducing a charming new hero, the Comte de Moret, a real historical figure from the period. A young cavalier newly arrived in Paris, Moret is an illegitimate son of the former king, and thus half-brother to King Louis. The French Court seethes with intrigue as king, queen, and cardinal all vie for power, and young Moret soon finds himself up to his handsome neck in conspiracy, danger&#x2015;and passionate romance!<br><br> Dumas wrote seventy-five chapters of <em>The Red Sphinx</em>, all for serial publication, but he never quite finished it, and so the novel languished for almost a century before its first book publication in France in 1946. While Dumas never completed the book, he had earlier written a separate novella, The Dove, that recounted the final adventures of Moret and Cardinal Richelieu.<br><br> Now for the first time, in one cohesive narrative, <em>The Red Sphinx</em> and <em>The Dove</em> make a complete and satisfying storyline&#x2015;a rip-roaring novel of historical adventure, heretofore unknown to English-language readers, by the great Alexandre Dumas, king of the swashbucklers.</p><p><p>One of the most famous French writers of the nineteenth century, <strong>Alexandre Dumas</strong> (1802&#x2013;1870) first achieved success in the literary world a playwright, before turning his hand to writing novels. In two years from 1844 to 1845, he published two enormous books, <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> and <em>The Three Musketeers</em>. Both novels have sold millions of copies worldwide.</p><p><strong>Lawrence Ellsworth</strong> is the pen name of Lawrence Schick. He began his career as a writer at TSR Hobbies, where he was instrumental in the early popularity of the role-playing game "Dungeons &amp; Dragons." An authority on historical adventure fiction, Ellsworth is the editor of <em>The Big Book of Swashbuckling Adventure</em> as well as the translator of Alexandre Dumas&#x2019;s <em>The Red Sphinx</em> and&nbsp;<em>The Three Musketeers</em>. He lives in northern Maryland.</p>&#x201c;Newly translated, a sequel to <em>The Three Musketeers</em> is as fresh as ever. In Lawrence Ellsworth&#x2019;s excellent, compulsively readable translation, <em>The Red Sphinx</em> is just the book to see you through the January doldrums. And maybe those of February, too.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Dirda, <em>The Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Red Sphinx</em> sparkles and shines in a new translation. Races along with pointed humor and broad quips. Fun permeates this big book. The rest of 2017's fiction will have to look sharp: An old master has just set the bar very, very high.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Christian Science Monitor</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A royal treat for fans of historical fiction. I am confident that librarians and English literature teachers around the world are leaping for joy at the publication of <em>The Red Sphinx</em>, and I join them in this excitement.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Bookreporter</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fans of <em>The Three Musketeers</em> can rejoice in the 800-page English translation of this largely forgotten sequel.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Newsday</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Dumas&#x2019;s trademark gifts at crafting engaging historical romances are amply in evidence in this lengthy yet fast-paced volume. Ellsworth&#x2019;s translation captures a complete narrative. A very entertaining epic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;There is swash and buckle aplenty, and even plumage if that&#x2019;s what does it for you. And it is great fun.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Spectator</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Red Sphinx</em> is wonderful. There&#x2019;s plot and counter-plot, duels, passion, murder, romance, disguises, poets and assassins. Readable and compelling.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Historical Novels Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Red Sphinx</em> is a vivid and beautifully-crafted story dense with colorful characters and an irresistible charm.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tony Cliff, author of the 'New York Times' bestselling &#x201c;Delilah Dirk&#x201d; graphic novels</strong></p><h2>Astronomy: Journey to the Cosmic Frontier</h2><p><i>Astronomy: Journey to the Cosmic Frontier</i>, 6th edition, provides enough content and background in astronomy so the student will be able to follow current developments in astronomy years after they complete the course.

Almost immediately, Genthe was attracted by Chinatown, or "Tangrenbu" &#x2014; a teeming ten-block area of crowded buildings, narrow streets, and exotic sights and sounds in the shadow of Nob Hill.<br>Fascinated by a living culture totally foreign to his experience, Genthe began to photograph Tangrenbu and its inhabitants. Today, these photographs (over 200 are known to exist) are the best visual documentary record of Chinatown at the turn of the century, offering priceless glimpses of the rich street life of the district before it was leveled by the great earthquake and fire of 1906.<br>Rediscover the lost world of old Chinatown in serene and enduring images of cobbled streets and bustling shops, street vendors and merchants, fish and vegetable markets, Devil's Kitchen, the Street of the Gamblers, Portsmouth Square and more. But most of all, enjoy distinctive candid portraits of the people of old Chinatown: a pipe-bowl member, a paper gatherer, itinerant peddlers, toy merchants, boys playing shuttlecock, a fortune-teller, a sword dancer, women and children in ornate holiday finery, an aged opium smoker and many other unaffected and revealing images.<br>Rich in detail and atmosphere, the photographs are complemented by historian John Tchen's informative and well-researched text, which outlines the turbulent history of Chinese-Americans in California, dispels numerous myths about Chinatown and its residents, and illuminates the role of Genthe's photographs in capturing the subtle flavor and texture of everyday life in the district before 1906.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Exploring Arduino: Tools and Techniques for Engineering Wizardry</h2><p><p><b>Learn to easily build gadgets, gizmos, robots, and more usingArduino</b></p><p>Written by Arduino expert Jeremy Blum, this unique book uses thepopular Arduino microcontroller platform as an instrument to teachyou about topics in electrical engineering, programming, andhuman-computer interaction.

Only hours earlier two masked men had walked the mild-mannered accountant out of his farmhouse and clinically blasted him with a shotgun.

Focusing on cutting-edge leadership, management systems, processes, procedures, and techniques, the authors synthesize changes such as:<br> <ul> <li><br> </li> <li>Increasing cultural diversity.<br> </li> <li>Powerful new social responsibility initiatives.<br> </li> <li>The arrival of a truly global marketplace.</li> </ul> <br> <p>This is an inspiring book for managers, consultants, strategists, and leaders planning for success in the business world in the 21st century.</p></p><p><i>Spiral Dynamics</i> reveals the hidden codes that shape human nature, create global diversities, and drive evolutionary change. These magnetic forces attract and repel individuals, form the webs that connect people within organizations, and forge the rise and fall of nations and cultures. This book tracks our historic emergence from clans to tribes to networks and holograms; identifies seven Variations on Change, and adds power and precision to the design of human systems and 21st century leadership.<br> <p><i>Spiral Dynamics</i> is an extension and elaboration of the biopsychosocial systems concept of the late Clare W. Graves; work that Canada's <i>Maclean's Magazine</i> called 'The Theory that Explains Everything'. The authors mesh UK biologist Richard Dawkins' concept of 'memes' with Gravesian 'value systems' in crafting a timely transformational change formula and process. Their concept of MEMES represents the first major statement of the new 'Science of Memetics.'<br> </p> <p>Don Edward Beck and Christopher C. Cowan, who were closely associated with Clare W. Graves, apply the principles of <i>Spiral Dynamics</i> worldwide in both corporate and top-level governmental sectors. They helped transform South Africa out of race categories, design organizational and marketing systems for a wide range of industries, and revitalize local communities, educational and professional institutions, and sports programs. Based on motivational MEMEs, they also designed a "hearts and minds" strategy for the South African rugby union team, winners of the 1995 World Cup.<br> </p> <p>Beck and Cowan were on the faculty of the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas, for a number of years before forming the National Values Center.</p><b>Don Beck</b> is Co-founder of The National Values Center, Denton, Texas.

Don&#39;t you know the Bible says...&#34; It&#39;s a challenge we have to meet. If we can&#39;t reconcile apparent contradictions between Scripture and Catholic teaching, how can our own faith survive? And if we can&#39;t help our Protestant brothers and sisters overcome their preconceptions about &#34;unbiblical&#34; Catholic doctrines and practices, how will they ever come to embrace the fullness of the Faith? In Meeting the Protestant Challenge, Karlo Broussard gives you the knowledge and tools you need to answer fifty of the most common Bible-based objections to Catholicism. How can the Mass be a sacrifice when the Bible says it&#39;s just a memorial? Why do Catholics stress good works when the Bible says we&#39;re saved by faith? Scripture says that all have sinned-so what Catholics believe about Mary being &#34;immaculate&#34; is plainly false. Jesus said to call no man father, yet that&#39;s what Catholics call their priests! How much clearer could it be? For these challenges and many more, Karlo provides a step-by-step plan for understanding the roots of the objection, breaking down the context and full meaning of the Scripture passages, anticipating followup arguments, and offering your own friendly counter-challenge to help Protestants begin to see how the Bible and Catholic teaching actually coexist in harmony. Don&#39;t get caught off guard! When the next biblical challenge comes, be ready to meet it with confidence.</p><p>Karlo Broussard is a staff apologist and speaker for Catholic Answers.

Mark grew up in an atheistic home, and after his father's death, began a skeptical search for truth through exploring science, philosophy, and history, asking the big questions of life, and eventually finding answers in Christianity.<br><br>In a disarming, winsome, and persuasive way,&nbsp;<i>The Problem of God</i> responds to the top ten questions people raise against God, and Christianity, including, among others:<br><ul><li>The Problem of Science</li><li>The Problem of God's Existence</li><li>The Problem of the Bible</li><li>The Problem of Evil and Suffering</li><li>The Problem of Hell</li><li>The Problem of Sex</li><li>The Problem of Hypocrisy &nbsp;</li></ul>Each chapter answers the specific challenge using a mix of theology, philosophy, and science on the one hand, while also using stories, illustrations, and anecdotes. It's apologetics for the rest of us,&nbsp;focused on both convincing the skeptic, and informing the Christian.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Mark Clark is the founding pastor of Village Church in Vancouver, Canada,&nbsp;one of the fastest growing multi-site churches in North America.

From the moment the destitute Prussian Adolph Coors stows away on a Baltimore-bound ship in 1868 to the worldwide expansion of the billion-dollar Coors Brewing Company, <em>Citizen Coors</em> is a headlong American tale of triumph over bare-knuckle competition. The Coors family does it the old-fashioned way, through fearsome devotion to product, rejection of modern marketing, and refusing to borrow so much as a nickel.</p><p><br>&nbsp; But the family almost rides its principles into the ground. "Nobody will ever choose a beer on the basis of a thirty-second ad," Bill Coors is fond of saying at a time when his two main competitors, Anheuser-Busch and Miller,&nbsp; are spending upward of a billion dollars a year on ads. He won't even allow a ring-pull can.&nbsp; The brewery's decline and recovery are dizzying.</p><p><br>But <em>Citizen Coors</em> is more than a business story. Here is Adolph, the founder,in 1929, distraught over Prohibition, hurling himself to his death from a hotel balcony. Here is Bill,ten years later, yearning for the wider world but forced back to the brewery by a single glance from his father. Here is Joe, Jr., raised to rule yet suddenly banished for marrying without permission. Here is Peter, prevented from rescuing the company precisely because he has been trained to do so. Here is kidnapping and murder. Here are generations of Coors men broken against the iron will of their fathers. Here is a second suicide, eerily similar to the first.</p><p><em>Citizen Coors </em>is finally a chronicle of how America was shaped politically in the last three decades of the twentieth century. For along with the Coors family's adherence to handshake integrity and old-world craft came some less roseate ideals from the nineteenth century: that disparity of wealth is proper, that government efforts to achieve social equality are illegitimate, that the Bible is the rule book for intimate conduct, and that capital must never bow to labor. The Coors family forever changed the American political landscape by creating the Heritage Foundation and a right-wing TV network, by financing the conservative shift in Congress, and by being early backers of a politically ambitious B-movie actor named Ronald Reagan. </p><p><br>&nbsp; In retaliation, blacks, feminists, unions, gays, and environmentalists came together to bash Coors in perhaps the most effective consumer boycott of modern times--a boycott that continues to hobble the company.</p><p><br>&nbsp; Based on more than 150 interviews, <em>Citizen Coors</em> serves up a powerful cocktail of beer and politics. Dan Baum, a former reporter for the <em>Wall Street Journal,</em> captures in this rollicking narrative the genius, eccentricity, and tragic weaknesses of the remarkable Coors family.</p>With enough private dramas to put them on par with the Ewings of <em>Dallas</em>, and enough business crises to keep them constantly in the business hot-seat, the ultra-right-wing Coors of Golden, Colorado, represent one of the more riveting family sagas of our time. Their billion-dollar empire grew out of a single brewery begun in 1873, but it wasn't long before the family became known as much for their right-wing politics as their beer. <p>The third generation of Coors men financed the birth of the Heritage Foundation, which jump-started the Reagan revolution. Old-fashioned about business and equally dubious of new ideas, they consistently ignored the importance of marketing until they were forced to, finally introducing the "Silver Bullet," and improved their image with unions and minorities only after they were compelled to do so by years of boycotts. Former Wall Street Journal reporter Dan Baum captures the eccentricity and foibles of this family and company in this fast-paced tale of vivid characters in business and politics.With enough private dramas to put them on par with the Ewings of <em>Dallas</em>, and enough business crises to keep them constantly in the business hot-seat, the ultra-right-wing Coors of Golden, Colorado, represent one of the more riveting family sagas of our time.

The elements that led to its ascension make quite a story, too: a destitute but hard-driving immigrant founder; kidnapping, suicides, and murder; secretive, right-wing politics and boisterous consumer boycotts; and, to top it off, an aristocratic ruling family that never dealt well with outsiders. To make sense of it all, former <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter Dan Baum interviewed more than 150 people, excluding, unfortunately, the primary family members, who still routinely refuse to talk to outsiders. Nevertheless, Baum tells this colorful Hollywood-esque tale in a comprehensive and compelling manner. He shows with considerable insight how the corporate and familial tone was set early by patriarch Adolph, a figure so domineering he "was still effectively running the company more than 60 years" after his death. And he shows with equal clarity why Peter, the heir, ultimately turned to an outsider to help the company address its competition in a way befitting a prototypical American business. An interesting tale, well told. --<i>Howard Rothman</i>Dan Baum has been a staff reporter for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, the <em>Asian Wall Street Journal</em>, and the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution,</em> and now writes occasionally for <em>Rolling Stone</em>.

But, as Judith Flanders shows in her most ambitious work to date, "home" is a relatively new idea. </p><p> In <i>The Making of Home</i>, Flanders traces the evolution of the house from the sixteenth to the early twentieth century across northern Europe and America, showing how the homes we know today bear only a faint resemblance to homes though history. What turned a house into a home? Why did northwestern Europe, a politically unimportant, sociologically underdeveloped region of the world, suddenly became the powerhouse of the Industrial Revolution, the capitalist crucible that created modernity? While investigating these important questions, Flanders uncovers the fascinating development of ordinary household items--from cutlery, chairs and curtains, to fitted kitchens, plumbing and windows--while also dismantling many domestic myths. </p><p> In this prodigiously researched and engagingly written book, Flanders elegantly draws together the threads of religion, history, economics, technology and the arts to show not merely what happened, but why it happened: how we ended up in a world where we can all say, like Dorothy in Oz, "There's no place like home."</p></p><p>JUDITH FLANDERS is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and one of the foremost social historians of the Victorian era.

Some segments, for their value in understanding home traditions from the past, beg to be broken off and expanded into their own books...

Flanders demonstrates how nakedly the measure of our social worth is laid out in domestic consumables. She is an efficient debunker of myths about poverty, family and the past. In her search for meaning she wipes the dust, clears the cobwebs and pulls the stuffing out of the cushions. It is in the down and dirty of the home that our hopes and delusions are revealed.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Financial Times (UK)</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;From the humble shack to the modern high-rise, Judith Flanders brilliantly illuminates the meaning of 'home' throughout history. <i>The Making of Home</i> is a fascinating and ambitious exploration into the soul of family life.

Flanders writes with bubbling enthusiasm about the old markets, Covent Garden and Smithfield, with their accompanying din and smells, and the plethora of life we only know through Dickens' eyes: the street vendors and artists, matchstick sellers, slum dwellers, prostitutes, habitu�s of gin palaces and prisoners. A terrific companion while reading Boz himself.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Kirkus on THE VICTORIAN CITY</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Flanders (The Invention of Murder) successfully recreates the feel of London at Dickens's peak as she delves deep into the rhythms and architecture of particular neighborhoods.... Flanders's expertise shines when exposing Dickens's embellishments, particularly when his character Fagin faces execution rather than the less powerful but more realistic punishment of deportment. This well-researched sociological overview provides highly detailed context for cultural touchstones, while shattering the popular yet inauthentic image of a pristine Victorian age that never existed.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly on THE VICTORIAN CITY</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Outstanding.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Sunday Times (London) on THE VICTORIAN CITY</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;The teeming, bustling, hand-to-mouth and often smelly facts of mid-19th century urban life have seldom been more vividly presented than in this book.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Literary Review on THE VICTORIAN CITY</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;With infectious enthusiasm Judith Flanders dives into the sights, smells, sounds and grit of what was then the largest city the world had ever known: London.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Sunday Telegraph (London) on THE VICTORIAN CITY</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Full of detail and colour about everyday life in Dickens's London, and leaves you with a sense not only of how hard life was then, but how strange.

I think it's Judith Flanders' best book yet, which is saying something.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Andrew Taylor</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Meticulous and gripping... Flanders says that Dickens appealed to contemporaries because he gave them a voyage into the unknown: into parts of London they did not know and where they would not venture. She does something similar for us. The strangeness remains, but the voyage is unforgettable.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Independent (UK) on THE VICTORIAN CITY</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Flanders captures the variety and colour of 19th-century London, stirring admiration and indignation by turns.

[Flanders] shines in her readings of literary novels containing criminal and detective elements, such as Oliver Twist, Mary Barton and Tess of the D'Urbervilles, but can be sharp and very funny about the vagaries of melodramatic and sensational plotting. Holmes once chided Watson, 'You see but you don't observe.' Ms. Flanders does both. This is an enticing book for any reader who, like the genteel lady in Emily Eden's The Semi-Detached House (1859), admits: 'There is such a grand murder in the paper . . . a whole family poisoned . . . it is very shocking, but I like to hear about it.'&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Wall Street Journal on THE INVENTION OF MURDER</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Flanders' meticulous research, personable style and keen insights are bliss for anyone interested in the Victorians and their quirks.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Seattle Times on THE INVENTION OF MURDER</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Superb...

It was a simple sentence &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;face &nbsp;of &nbsp;it, &nbsp;but there was &nbsp;something&nbsp; &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;tone, something &nbsp;knowing &nbsp;and &nbsp;even&nbsp; caring, &nbsp;that &nbsp;let Adam &nbsp;know &nbsp;that nothing &nbsp;would ever be the same.<br><br> &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t have to stay with her,&#x201d; the stranger said.<br><br> They were in the American Legion Hall in Cedarfield, New Jersey.

His arms were white and reedy with a hint of a tattoo showing beneath one of the short sleeves. He was wearing a baseball cap.

But he didn&#x2019;t for two reasons.<br><br> One, there was the whole &nbsp;dazed-like-taking-punches, sapped- resistance thing.<br><br> Two, something about the way the man spoke, something about the guy&#x2019;s confident tone, the damn conviction in his voice, made Adam start thinking it might be smartest to listen.<br><br> &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; Adam asked. &#x201c;Does it matter?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, it does.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the stranger,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The stranger with important knowledge. She lied to you, Adam. Corinne. &nbsp;She was never pregnant. It was all a ruse to get you back.&#x201d;<br><br> Adam shook his head. He swam through, tried to stay rational and calm. &#x201c;I saw the pregnancy test.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Fake.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I saw the sonogram.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Again fake.&#x201d; He held up a hand before Adam could say more. &#x201c;And yes, so was the stomach. &nbsp;Or should I say stomachs. &nbsp;Once Corinne started to show, you never saw her naked, right? What did she do, claim some kind of late-night sickness so you wouldn&#x2019;t have sex? That&#x2019;s what happens most times. &nbsp;So when the miscarriage occurs, you can kinda look back on the whole thing and realize the pregnancy was difficult right from the start.&#x201d;<br><br> A booming voice from the other side of the hall called out, &#x201c;Okay, guys, grab a fresh beer and let&#x2019;s get this show on the road.&#x201d; The voice belonged to Tripp Evans, the president of the lacrosse league, a former Madison Avenue ad exec and a pretty good guy. The other dads started to grab aluminum chairs, the kind you use for your kid&#x2019;s school concert, from a rack and placed them in a circle around the room. Tripp Evans looked over at Adam, spotted the undoubtedly pale expression on his face, and frowned his concern. Adam shook him off and turned back to the stranger. <br><br>&#x201c;Who the hell are you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Think of me as your savior. Or like the friend who just released you from prison.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re full of crap.&#x201d;<br><br> All conversation had pretty much ended. &nbsp;The voices were hushed now, the sounds of scraping chairs echoing in the still hall. The fathers were getting their game faces on for the draft. Adam hated this. He wasn&#x2019;t even supposed to be here&#x2014;Corinne was. She was the treasurer of the lacrosse board, but her school had changed the scheduling of her teachers&#x2019; conference in Atlantic City, and even though this was the biggest day of the year for Cedarfield lacrosse&#x2014; indeed the main reason Corinne had become so active&#x2014;Adam had been forced to step in for her.<br><br> &#x201c;You should be thanking me,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;<br><br> For the first time, the man smiled. It was, Adam couldn&#x2019;t help but notice, a kind smile, the smile of a healer, of a man who just wants to do the right thing.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re free,&#x201d; the stranger said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a liar.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You know better, don&#x2019;t you, Adam?&#x201d;<br><br> From across the room, Tripp Evans called, &#x201c;Adam?&#x201d;<br><br> He turned toward them. Everyone was seated now except Adam and the stranger.<br><br> &#x201c;I have to go now,&#x201d; the stranger whispered. <br><br>&#x201c;But if you really need proof, check your Visa card. &nbsp;Look for a charge to Novelty Funsy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wait&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;One more thing.&#x201d; The man leaned in close. &#x201c;If I were you, I&#x2019;d probably run DNA tests on your two boys.&#x201d;<br><br> Tick, tick, tick . . . ka-boom. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I have no evidence on that, but when a woman is willing to lie about something like this, well, it&#x2019;s a pretty good bet it isn&#x2019;t her first time.&#x201d;<br><br> And then, with Adam dazed anew by this final accusation, the stranger hurried out the door.</p><h2>Anxious Pleasures: A Novel after Kafka</h2><p><i>Anxious Pleasures</i> takes Franz Kafka's profoundly haunting and sad comic novella, <i>The Metamorphosis,</i> and reanimates it through the vantage points of those who surrounded Gregor Samsa during his plight. All the familiar characters are here, including the hysterical mother, stern father, faithless sister, and the pragmatic household cook. But we are also introduced to, among others, the would-be author downstairs who daydreams of the narrative he may someday compose and a young woman in contemporary London reading Kafka's slim book for the first time.<br>Or do they all comprise a few of the disturbing dreams from which Gregor is about to snap awake one morning to find himself transformed into a monstrous vermin? In the tradition of Michael Cunningham's <i>The Hours</i> and John Gardner's <i>Grendel,</i> Olsen's novel not only represents a collaboration with a ghost, but, too, a celebration, augmentation, complication, and devoted unwriting of a momentously influential text.</p><p>Combining his dexterity for cutting-edge experimentation and a love of classic literature, Olsen takes on Franz Kafka's surreal novella "The Metamorphosis" and ingeniously adapts the story line to multiple perspectives. In the original, Kafka chose authorial omniscience to recount the misfortunes of traveling salesman Gregor Samsa, who awakens one morning to find himself transformed into a "monstrous vermin." Olsen surveys the unsettling events in the Samsa household from the viewpoints of, respectively, Gregor's sister Greta, his parents, the kitchen staff, and even a contemporary London woman perusing Kafka's yarn in a British Museum reading room. The essential twist in Olsen's interpretation is that Gregor never actually changes into anything except his birthday suit. He merely goes mad, hallucinating his insectile transformation. This variation allows Olsen free rein to incorporate stray biographical details from Kafka's life and allusions to his other works, most notably "The Hunger Artist." While some Kafka connoisseurs may embrace Olsen's creative retelling, others may just be driven back to the original masterpiece. <i>Carl Hays</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>Following <i>Nietzsche's Kisses </i>(2006), Olsen treats another great modernist to postmodernist investigation, this time retelling Kafka's <i>The Metamorphosis</i> from the supporting cast's points-of-view. Olsen hews closely to the original, and his additions, excursions and elaborations are simultaneously stimulating and entertaining: intermittent sections relate the contemporary story of Margaret, an insecure young woman whose grandparents have gone missing and who is reading Kafka's masterpiece for the first time, and that of the Samsas' downstairs neighbor, a writer who is inspired by the strange noises upstairs to write a novella-length allegory in which "a man will awake with meat cleavers for hands. The moral will be that the meaning of life is that it stops." Characters who appear only briefly in Kafka's work here provide texture and a broader canvas, but the Samsa family, though given magnificent voices, aren't particularly developed. Intricately woven and richly imagined, Olsen's novel is a cerebral treat unto itself and a fine companion to Kafka's original. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It traces the history of dyes and pigments from cave paintings to modern textiles. The book's four sections cover the uses of color in ancient times; its development and refinement in the Middle Ages; the explosion of supply and demand after the Renaissance; and the triumph of industrial chemistry in synthesizing and inventing colors. Production processes often paralleled those of alchemy, giving an almost magical quality to colors. Dyes were expensive in medieval Europe and could increase the price of a cloth tenfold; thus color was used to indicate social status, with aristocrats in bright robes standing out against the drab mob. Since antiquity, writers have compiled technical manuals on dyeing and pigment manufacture, often using more ancient texts, so that a great many antique recipes and techniques have been preserved. We learn, for example, how Indian yellow was made from a concentrated extract of the urine of cows fed exclusively on mango leaves (which was not healthy for the cows). Every page of the book has interesting tidbits of information, such as the derivation of blue jeans (from <i>bleu de Genes</i>, Genoa blue, a form of indigo). Clearly written and well-designed, <i>Colors</i> reminds us of the powerful ways color permeates our lives. <i>--John Stevenson</i>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Tale of Anabelle Hedgehog (Riverbank)</h2><p>The yellow dog is a menace.

Marcinko did his job too well. His reward was a year in a federal penitentiary. </p><p>During that year, Marcinko and John Weisman wrote <i>Rogue Warrior</i>...but government restrictions meant Marcinko could only tell a fraction of his incredible story. Now the secrets he could not reveal explode on the page as the <i>Rogue Warrior</i> returns in the blockbuster suspense novel of the year -- a novel with him as the hero! </p><p>As <i>ROGUE WARRIOR II: RED CELL</i> begins, Marcinko, now a freelance security expert, makes a shocking discovery: smugglers are transferring nuclear materials to North Korea through Japan -- with backing from traitorous Americans. Recalled involuntarily to command RED CELL and stop the operation, the <i>Rogue Warrior</i>, with his loyal SEALs, will do anything to crush those who would betray America for a price. Based on current SEAL tactics, <i>ROGUE WARRIOR II: RED CELL</i> is an electrifying, sure-fire hit.</p>Rogue Warrior, a blood-and-guts account of Marcinko's stormy- petrel career as a Navy SEAL, earned its author a top spot on 1992's bestseller lists. He could land on the charts again with this fictive sequel whose profanely opinionated, relentlessly macho, and immensely entertaining narrator is a retired naval commander named Richard Marcinko. Now a freelance operative, Marcinko is testing security at Tokyo's Narita Airport, where he finds that treacherous Americans are supplying Japanese and North Korean buyers with nuclear detonators. The trail appears to lead back to Grant Griffith, a former Defense Secretary who retains considerable clout in Washington as well as with the ailing military-industrial complex. Before Marcinko can bring the influential elder statesman to book, however, he's dragged into a deadly series of turf battles, shootouts, sting operations, and shadow wars. By no coincidence, moreover, he's recalled to active duty by Admiral Pinckney Prescott III, a longtime nemesis who puts him in command of the Red Cell, a unit that's Prescott's own creation. With help from friends in the old-boy network of Special Forces personnel, Marcinko's merry men run wild--on assignment or off--covertly acquiring the high-tech tools of their violent trade, infiltrating laxly guarded bases in the US, and otherwise trying the patience of higher authority. Leaving scores of corpses in their wake, Red Cell stalwarts find time to carry out a reconnaissance/sabotage mission in North Korean waters and to launch a mid-ocean assault (from a stolen aircraft) on a contraband-carrying vessel crewed by black-hat mercenaries. Fast action and advanced weaponry at every turn; in-your-face commentary on the powers that be; a steady stream of imaginatively salty language: What more could any red-blooded, two-fisted, he-man fantasist want? -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Technology will allow us to solve problems in highly original ways and create new incentives to get more people to do the right thing. But how will such solutionism&#x201d; affect our society, once deeply political, moral, and irresolvable dilemmas are recast as uncontroversial and easily manageable matters of technological efficiency? What if some such problems are simply vices in disguise? What if some friction in communication is productive and some hypocrisy in politics necessary? The temptation of the digital age is to fix everything from crime to corruption to pollution to obesity by digitally quantifying, tracking, or gamifying behavior. But when we change the motivations for our moral, ethical, and civic behavior we may also change the very nature of that behavior. Technology, Evgeny Morozov proposes, can be a force for improvement but only if we keep solutionism in check and learn to appreciate the imperfections of liberal democracy. Some of those imperfections are not accidental but by design.<br><br>Arguing that we badly need a new, post-Internet way to debate the moral consequences of digital technologies, <i>To Save Everything, Click Here</i> warns against a world of seamless efficiency, where everyone is forced to wear Silicon Valley's digital straitjacket.<br></p><p><b>Evgeny Morozov</b> (@evgenymorozov) is the author of <i>The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet Freedom</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of 2011 and winner of Harvard's Kennedy School's 2012 Goldsmith Book Prize.

'Once an infidel and libertine, a servant of slaves in Africa,' he wrote for this epitaph, 'by rich mercy of Jesus Christ, preserved, restored, pardoned, and appointed to preach the faith he had long laboured to destroy.' <br> It was through his prolific correspondence that Newton fulfilled his distinctive word as 'the letter-writer parexcellence of the Evangelical Revival'. His grasp of Scripture and deep personal experience of the 'amazing grace' of Goed, his many friends (among them, Whitefield, Cowper and Wilberforce), his manifold trials, his country pastorate, his strong, clear, idiomatic style- all these factors combined to prepare the author of 'How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds', for the exercise of his special gift. <br> These letters, selected by his biographer, Josiah Bull, bear the practical imprint of all of Newton's writings; they cover a wide variety of subjects and aim 'to conform the believer to Christ'. Among them are several that were not previously published in earlier collections of his correspondence. Of particular value and interest are the biographical sketches and historical notes supplied by the editor.</p><p>Born in London in 1725, deprived of the godly influence of his mother before he was seven years old, John Newton was but two years at school before he went, at the age of eleven, on his first voyage with his father, a sea captain. From that time till the age of thirty, when his health was broken by a stroke, Newton endured the wild rigours of a life before the mast, including being press-ganged aboard a naval vessel and flogged when captured after desertion. Only his love for the youthful Mary Catlett preserved him from suicide. He was released from the navy only to join in the slave traffic across the Atlantic, and was reduced almost to death on the Guinea coast before being delivered by a friend of his father's. <br><br>Throughout these sad events there ran a divine purpose; and while Newton forgot the Saviour whom his mother had so often commended to him in childhood, and while he became, like one of old, a 'blasphemer and injurious,' it was all leading to a day in the midst of a tremendous storm at sea when he was brought to say: 'I stood in need of an Almighty Saviour, and such a one I found described in the New Testament. The Lord had wrought a marvellous thing.''In few writers are christian doctrine, experience and practice more happily balanced than in the author of these Letters, and few write with more simplicity, piety and force.' --<strong><i>Charles Spurgeon</i></strong><br><br>'When thousands have derived repeated profit and pleasure from the perusal of these utterances of the heart!

The answer is a resounding yes. <i>Master of the Mountain</i>, Henry Wiencek's eloquent, persuasive book&#x2015;based on new information coming from archaeological work at Monticello and on hitherto overlooked or disregarded evidence in Jefferson's papers&#x2015;opens up a huge, poorly understood dimension of Jefferson's world. We must, Wiencek suggests, follow the money.</p><p>So far, historians have offered only easy irony or paradox to explain this extraordinary Founding Father who was an emancipationist in his youth and then recoiled from his own inspiring rhetoric and equivocated about slavery; who enjoyed his renown as a revolutionary leader yet kept some of his own children as slaves. But Wiencek's Jefferson is a man of business and public affairs who makes a success of his debt-ridden plantation thanks to what he calls the "silent profits" gained from his slaves&#x2015;and thanks to a skewed moral universe that he and thousands of others readily inhabited. We see Jefferson taking out a slave-equity line of credit with a Dutch bank to finance the building of Monticello and deftly creating smoke screens when visitors are dismayed by his apparent endorsement of a system they thought he'd vowed to overturn. It is not a pretty story. Slave boys are whipped to make them work in the nail factory at Monticello that pays Jefferson's grocery bills. Parents are divided from children&#x2015;in his ledgers they are recast as money&#x2015;while he composes theories that obscure the dynamics of what some of his friends call "a vile commerce."</p><p>Many people of Jefferson's time saw a catastrophe coming and tried to stop it, but not Jefferson. The pursuit of happiness had been badly distorted, and an oligarchy was getting very rich. Is this the quintessential American story?</p></p><p><b>Henry Wiencek</b>, a nationally prominent historian and writer, is the author of several books, including <i>The Hairstons: An American Family in Black and White</i>, which won a National Book Critics Circle Award in 1999, and <i>An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America </i>(FSG, 2003). He lives with his wife and son in Charlottesville, Virginia.Master of the Mountain (Chapter 1) <p>The thunderstorm that shook the mountain during the telling of Peter Fossett's story passed. We tourists were deposited back into the present, with shafts of sunlight illuminating a peaceful scene--a broad pathway stretching into the distance, disappearing over the curve of the hillside. Jefferson named it Mulberry Row for the fast-growing shade trees he planted here in the 1790s. One thousand yards long, it was the main street of the African-American hamlet atop Monticello Mountain. The plantation was a small town in everything but name, not just because of its size, but in its complexity. Skilled artisans and house slaves occupied cabins on Mulberry Row alongside hired white workers; a few slaves lived in rooms in the mansion's south dependency wing; some slept where they worked. Most of Monticello's slaves lived in clusters of cabins scattered down the mountain and on outlying farms. In his lifetime Jefferson owned more than 600 slaves. At any one time about 100 slaves lived on the mountain; the highest slave population, in 1817, was 140.1</p> <p>The labyrinths of Monticello mirror the ambiguities of its maker. As you approach the house, you are taken in by one of Jefferson's cleverest tricks: through the artful arrangement of windows he achieved the illusion of having his three-story building appear to have only one floor. He <i>had</i> to have a house like the ones he'd seen in Paris when he was the U.S. minister there. "All the new and good houses are of a single story," Jefferson said, in the tone of someone who has discovered a new law of physics.</p> <p>So in the 1790s he tore apart his first house--eight rooms, two floors--and began work on a twenty-one-room mansion, ingeniously concealing its bulk. Its innovations included skylights, indoor privies, and a system of drainpipes and cisterns to capture rainwater. He brainstormed on novel solutions for ventilating smells and smoke, such as tunnels to carry away the odor of the privies and an underground piping system to direct the smoke of cooking fires away from the house. He built the privy tunnels, through which a slave had to crawl once a month, for a dollar, to clean them; he dropped the idea of the underground pipes, considered smokestacks in the shape of obelisks, and finally settled on just having chimneys.2</p> <p>One feature that Monticello does not have is a grand staircase, usually the centerpiece of a Virginia squire's entrance hall. A waste of space, Jefferson thought, and in any event he didn't need one, because he rarely went upstairs. He had everything he needed in his private, L-shaped suite of rooms on the main floor--the bedroom, the study or "cabinet," the book room, and the greenhouse, with its access to a private terrace and the lawns. A visitor called this spacious domain Jefferson's "sanctum sanctorum." His extended family--beloved daughter, impecunious son-in-law, widowed sister, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews--packed themselves into the second and third floors, reached by an extremely narrow, steep, and winding staircase--a treacherous ascent for anyone and doubly dangerous for someone carrying a load or a squirming infant. Jeff Randolph recalled the cramped quarters allotted him as a child: "I slept a whole winter in an outer closet."3 The granddaughters, desperate for private space where they could read and write, improvised their own sitting room out of an architectural gap over a portico, contending with wasps for control of the room.4</p> <p>Jefferson grasped the ways geometry talks to the eye and mind, and in his hands that arid specialty yielded visual music. He imparted an uncanny sense of motion to the inanimate mass of bricks, glass, and wood, playing variations on geometrical themes. The facades of Monticello and many of its rooms have no real corners, which puts the eye, expecting right angles, off-balance. (His design for his country retreat, Poplar Forest, which he started in 1806, called for a pure octagon containing a cube.) Today we are accustomed to skylights, but in his time people did not expect to stand indoors in gentle sunlight coming from above, banishing the expected shadows and making others.</p> <p>So innovative and eccentric in its irregularities and geometric illusions, Monticello not only baffled but irritated people of Jefferson's time, who expected something more conventionally pompous. "This incomprehensible pile," grumbled one visitor, calling the house "a monument of ingenious extravagance...without unity or uniformity." Another visitor, granted a rare tour of Jefferson's private suite of rooms by the master himself, pronounced herself "much disappointed in its appearance, and I do not think with its numerous divisions and arches it&nbsp;is as impressive as one large room would have been." Having heard the murmurings, Jefferson had to acknowledge that his "essay in architecture" was derided as being "among the curiosities of the neighborhood."5</p> <p>Then as now, people were charmed by gadgets, and Monticello was full of them. "Everything has a whimsical and droll appearance," said one guest.6 One enters the parlor through an automatic double door in which both doors open or close when just one is pushed, being linked by an unseen chain under the floor. A visitor to his sanctum sanctorum would have found telescopes, a microscope, thermometers, surveying equipment, and an astronomical clock for predicting eclipses. "His mind designs more than the day can fulfill," a visitor remarked. Laid up one day with rheumatism, Jefferson passed the hours "calculating the hour lines of a...dial for the latitude of this place."7 To satisfy an omnivorous mental appetite, he designed an ingenious revolving book holder that accommodated five open volumes at a time. Reclining on a chaise, he composed his voluminous correspondence at a polygraph, a two-pen, two-sheet proto-copying machine that produced a duplicate of a letter as it was written. Even his bed is an item of interest. He placed it in an alcove with open sides--on one side lay his dressing room, on the other his study--but the reason for the open alcove arrangement was not to provide convenient access to one room or the other from the bed but to create a "breezeway" through which the cool night air would flow with increased speed. It is often said that he invented the polygraph, which he did not, and to this day the rumor persists that his bed could be raised on ropes into a hidden compartment in the ceiling--a false story that expresses the abiding belief that Jefferson practiced all manner of disappearing tricks.</p> <p>Indeed, a great deal went on here out of sight. In designing the mansion, Jefferson followed a precept laid down two centuries earlier by Palladio: "We must contrive a building in such a manner that the finest and most noble parts of it be the most exposed to public view, and the less agreeable disposed in byplaces, and removed from sight as much as possible."8</p> <p>The mansion sits atop a long tunnel through which slaves, unseen, hurried back and forth carrying platters of food, fresh tableware, ice, beer, wine, and linens while above them twenty, thirty, or forty guests sat listening to Jefferson's dinner-table conversation. At one end of the tunnel lay the icehouse, at the other the kitchen, a hive of ceaseless activity where the enslaved cooks and their helpers produced one course after another.</p> <p>During dinner Jefferson would open a panel in the side of the fireplace, insert an empty wine bottle, and seconds later pull out a full bottle. We can imagine that he would delay explaining how this magic took place until an astonished guest put the question to him. The panel concealed a narrow dumbwaiter that descended to the basement. When Jefferson put an empty bottle in the compartment, a slave waiting in the basement pulled the dumbwaiter down, removed the empty, inserted a fresh bottle, and sent it up to the master in a matter of seconds. Similarly, platters of hot food magically appeared on a revolving door fitted with shelves, and the used plates disappeared from sight on the same contrivance. Guests could not see or hear any of the activity, nor the links between the visible world and the invisible that magically produced Jefferson's abundance.</p> <p>Looming above Mulberry Row was a long terrace where Jefferson appeared every day at first light, walking alone with his thoughts. A slave looking up from Mulberry Row would see a very imposing figure outlined against the magnificent architectural features of his mansion. Jefferson was a tall man, over six feet two inches, well muscled, and "straight as a gun barrel," his overseer Edmund Bacon said; "he had an iron constitution and was very strong."9 One of his slaves, the blacksmith Isaac Granger, remembered his master as "a tall, strait-bodied man as ever you see, right square-shouldered...a straight-up man, long face, high nose."10 Jefferson owned a spring-driven strength tester called a dynamometer that he imported from France to gauge the force needed to pull a new plow he was designing. He and his neighbors decided to test their own muscles on this proto-Nautilus machine. His son-in-law Colonel Thomas Mann Randolph could out-pull all contestants, but Jefferson beat him.11</p> <p>From his terrace Jefferson looked out upon an industrious, well-organized enterprise of black coopers, smiths, nail makers, a brewer, cooks professionally trained in French cuisine, a glazier, painters, millers, and weavers. Black managers, slaves themselves, oversaw other slaves. A team of highly skilled artisans constructed Jefferson's coach. The household staff ran what was essentially a midsized hotel, where some sixteen slaves waited upon the needs of a daily horde of guests.</p> <p>Below the mansion there stood John Hemmings's* cabinetmaking shop, called the joinery; a dairy; a stable; a small textile factory; and a vast garden carved from the mountainside--the cluster of industries Jefferson launched to supply his plantation and bring in cash. "To be independent for the comforts of life," Jefferson said, "we must fabricate them ourselves." He was speaking of America's need to develop manufacturing, but he had learned that truth on his plantation.12</p> <p>Jefferson looked down from his terrace onto a community of slaves he knew very well--an extended family and network of related families that had been in his ownership for two, three, or four generations. Though there were several surnames among the slaves on the mountaintop--Fossett, Hern, Colbert, Gillette, Brown, Hughes--they were all Hemingses by blood, descendants of the matriarch Elizabeth "Betty" Hemings, or Hemings relatives by marriage. "A peculiar fact about his house servants was that we were all related to one another," Peter Fossett said. Jefferson's grandson Jeff Randolph observed, "Mr. Js Mechanics and his entire household of servants...consisted of one family connection and their wives."13</p> <p>At dawn the cooks Edith Fossett and Fanny Hern would already be at work preparing breakfast for the household in the kitchen beneath the terrace, right below Jefferson's feet. When he was president and they were teenagers, Jefferson had personally selected them to live in the White House as apprentices to his French chef. Edith was the wife of the blacksmith Joseph Fossett, the son of Mary Hemings.</p> <p>Mary Hemings's younger sister Sally would be cleaning Jefferson's private suite, removing the chamber pot and the tub of cold water in which the master soaked his feet every morning upon awakening. In the other rooms of the mansion, Jefferson's daughter's family was stirring. He had asked them to move into Monticello when his presidential term ended--Martha had been with her father in Washington and before that in France--so in 1809 Monticello became the residence of Martha and her husband, Colonel Randolph, and their eight children, with three more children to come in the next few years.</p> <p>Jefferson's grandchildren knew the slaves on the mountaintop very well. They were devoted to John Hemmings and he to them. John and his wife, Priscilla, had no children, but to the presidential grandchildren Priscilla Hemmings was "Mammy" and John Hemmings "Daddy." The grandchildren felt perfectly at ease descending on "Daddy" Hemmings in his joinery. "All other amusements failing," one granddaughter remembered, "there was a visit to 'Daddy' in the carpenter's shops to beg for nails and bits of wood, or to urge on the completion of 'a box for my drawings,' or a table, or stand, or a flower box. 'Yes yes! my little mistises, but Grandpapa [Jefferson] comes first! There are new bookshelves to be made, trellises for the roses, besides farm work to be done.' This reply brought a clamor of tongues and 'You know Daddy you promised!'"14</p> <p>A relic of one of these visits turned up in an archaeologist's sieve. In Hemmings's joinery the diggers found a three-inch-long, jagged shard of broken slate, inscribed with an enigma, a passage of cursive writing:</p> <p>Beneath...</p> <p>As ugly B....</p> <p>Short...</p> <p>The slate had snapped apart, leaving only those words of a text that might have been part of a poem. Jefferson's grandchildren taught some of the slaves to read and write, and this might be a remnant of a lesson in the carpentry shop. Jefferson countenanced his grandchildren teaching the favored slaves (sixteen-year-old Cornelia gave John Hemmings a dictionary!) but did not entirely approve of it.15 "He was in favor of teaching the slaves to learn to read print and no more," one slave remembered; "to teach them to write would enable them to forge papers [and] they could no longer be kept in subjugation."16 But writing was more than a tool for would-be escapers. It was the era of the Enlightenment, and "the very idea of writing oneself free was typical of the eighteenth century, when writing seemed to be the visible sign of reason and imagination," writes one historian.17 Archaeologists have found writing slates and pencils all over the mountain, suggesting that many people tried to make themselves literate there.</p> <p>For decades archaeologists have been scouring Mulberry Row, finding mundane artifacts that testify to the ways life was lived in the workshops and cabins. They have found saw blades, a large drill bit, an axhead, blacksmith's pincers, a wall bracket made in the joinery for a clock in the mansion, scissors, thimbles, locks and a key, and finished nails forged, cut, and hammered by the nail boys.</p> <p>A large fragment of animal bone showed the marks of a gouge used for punching out buttons. It had been partly used and then discarded, evoking the image of a particular day in the distant past when someone had her bellyful of making buttons and just threw the damned thing away.</p> <p>There were marbles, dominoes, and a toy tea bowl left by the children--perhaps by Peter Fossett--as well as part of a Jew's harp and part of a violin neck. One Christmas, Cornelia was walking outside when she was stopped short by music. She turned and saw a "fiddler as he stood with half closed eyes and head thrown back, with one foot keeping time to his own scraping in the midst of a circle of attentive and admiring auditors."18</p> <p>The archaeologists also found a bundle of raw nailrod--a lost measure of iron handed out to a nail boy one dawn. Why was this bundle found in the dirt, unworked, instead of forged, cut, and hammered the way the boss told them? Once, a missing bundle of rod had started a fight in the nailery that got one boy's skull bashed in and another so...</p></p><h2>Managing Project Quality (Project Management Essential Library)</h2><p>Make breakthroughs in project quality by combining project management with quality management - this books shows you how.

He teaches literature and wilderness thought at the University of California at Davis and lives with his family on the San Juan Ridge in the Sierra foothills.Snyder writes as a missionary for the spiritual communions of our earth, but his cause is not well served by his own reading of it. From his very first words, Snyder conveys a sense of pedantry. He lectures carefully, speaking in jerky phrases with odd inflections and spaces his frequent lists as if to allow a student time for note-taking. He compounds this feeling by pronouncing foreign expressions, Native American or Oriental with a meticulous accent. Only when a section takes a narrative tone does his speech accelerate to a more conversational pace. This is a difficult type of literature to read without sounding like horatory. S.B.S.

Then simple wash techniques and the painting of light and shadows are presented. Next, step-by-step demonstrations show how to paint separate features of a still life or landscape&#x2014;fruit, vegetables, flowers, trees, and skies&#x2014;then how to combine these elements into lovely watercolor paintings.</p><p><b>Alwyn Cranshaw</b>, England&#x2019;s top television artist and popular author of art instructionals, is known for his particular expertise in teaching beginners.I worry when I see books claiming categorically that everyone can be taught to paint. These two books confidently insist that the "absolute" beginner can produce pastels and watercolors in no time. In Blake's attempt to prove this, she sensibly points out that pastels can be seen as crayons for adults no messy oils, tubes, and brushes to deal with. She takes the student from simple marks on a page through tone, perspective, and so forth to simple still lifes, landscapes, and figures. Despite initial doubts, Blake does deliver in this volume, and for those on a budget, it's less than half the price of Jackie Simmonds's more comprehensive Pastel Workbook: A Complete Course in Ten Lessons (LJ 11/15/99). With an identical format and purpose, Crawshaw takes on watercolor for the beginner. Starting with a basic flat wash, he advances to simple fruits and flowers, people and buildings. Unlike Blake, he skips certain drawing fundamentals. Nevertheless, this delightful little book will complement Mary Whyte's Watercolor for the Serious Beginner (LJ 3/15/98). Both step-by-step guides for the absolute beginner are recommended, especially for libraries on limited budgets. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Coach Wooden One-on-One: Inspiring Conversations on Purpose, Passion and the Pursuit of Success</h2><p>This book of 60 daily readings is the result of one-on-one conversations between basketball&#x2019;s legendary coach and teacher, John Wooden, and Jay Carty, former Laker and one time Wooden assistant.

At the age of nineteen, working as a cocktail waitress in Calgary, Alberta, she began saving her tips so she could travel the globe. Aspiring to understand the world and live a significant life, she backpacked through Latin America, Laos, Bangladesh, and India, and emboldened by each adventure, went on to Sudan, Syria, and Pakistan. In war-ridden Afghanistan and Iraq she carved out a fledgling career as a television reporter.

Moved between a series of abandoned houses in the desert, she survives on memory&#x2014;every lush detail of the world she experienced in her life before captivity&#x2014;and on strategy, fortitude, and hope. When she is most desperate, she visits a house in the sky, high above the woman kept in chains, in the dark, being tortured.<br> <br>Vivid and suspenseful, as artfully written as the finest novel, <i>A House in the Sky</i> is the searingly intimate story of an intrepid young woman and her search for compassion in the face of unimaginable adversity.</p><p><p></p> <p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, September 2013:</strong> Amanda Lindhout&#x2019;s story starts as a breathless travelogue, inspired by <em>National Geographic</em>: as a kid in rural Alberta, Lindhout scavenged bottles to buy thrift store copies of the magazine, escaping through its pages from a violent home into a vast, vibrant world. In her twenties, she sought out every amazing place she&#x2019;d always wanted to see, then kept going, loving the rush of pushing beyond the next border. Travel became her education, and a desire to make it her vocation as a freelance journalist draws her to Afghanistan, Iraq, and finally Somalia, where a hungry young reporter with guts might make a name for herself. Lindhout&#x2019;s hubris can be frustrating: intellectually, she knows Somalia is the &#x201c;most dangerous country on earth,&#x201d; but she still talks her former lover, freelance photojournalist Nigel Brennan, into coming along. By this time, both of them have moved through so many unpredictable places unscathed that the possibility of real peril is a hazy abstraction, and their abduction by armed extremists comes as a shock. As their captors hold out for a ransom of $1.5 million, Lindhout and Brennan defensively convert to Islam and try to remain sane through covert communication, but after a botched escape, Lindhout endures severe torture and repeated rape--and survival means drawing on her every reserve. Written with uncommon sensitivity (by Lindhout and cowriter Sara Corbett), <em>A House in the Sky</em> becomes a moving testament to her ability to cultivate resilience and a kind of spiritual transcendence, even in profound darkness. Witnessing her experience left profoundly grateful for everything I have, more sharply aware of how I choose to react to circumstances beyond my control. Most of us will never live a day like the 460 Lindhout spent in captivity, but we all have our trials, and we can cultivate our own resilience. --<em>Mari Malcolm</em></p> <p></p> <p><b>Guest Review of <em>A House in the Sky</em> </b></p><p></p><b> <p>By Susan Casey, author of <em><em>The Wave: In Pursuit of the Rogues, Freaks, and Giants of the Ocean</em></em></p> </b><p></p> <p>Growing up in the small town of Red Deer, Alberta, Amanda Lindhout dreamed big. She was a young girl with a curious streak the size of the Rockies, and though her wrong-side-of-the-tracks provenance seemed to promise only a flatline future, Lindhout decided to change her own fate. Out there, she knew, beyond a horizon dotted with oil rigs and trailer parks, magic awaited, a vast map filled with all things "lost or unexplored, mystical or wild."</p> <p>How did Lindhout know this? <em>National Geographic</em>. Paging through worn copies of the magazine, she was transported to every spectacular place she&#x2019;d never been: &#x201c;The world arrived in waves and flashes, as a silvery tide sweeping over a promenade in Havana or the glinting snowfields of Annapurna. The world was a tribe of pygmy archers in the Congo and the green geometry of Kyoto&#x2019;s tea gardens. It was a yellow-sailed catamaran in a choppy Arctic Sea."</p> <p>And so, fueled by waitressing wages and determination, Lindhout&#x2019;s travels begin, at first in idyllic ways, then accelerating and acquiring a degree of difficulty that would daunt any seasoned explorer. In short order, Lindhout&#x2014;working as a freelance journalist&#x2014;ventures into places like Kabul and Baghdad, Addis Ababa, the back alleys of Cairo, and then, finally, Somalia, where the stakes become nothing less than life or death.</p> <p>Lindhout&#x2019;s story is exhilarating and harrowing and several other brands of extreme, and it would be riveting however it was told. But in <em>A House in the Sky</em>, readers will find a rare and beautiful alchemy: writer Sara Corbett captures Lindhout&#x2019;s voice and spirit with utter mastery on the page, and a kind of ferocious grace that I found breathtaking.</p> <p>I know that&#x2019;s a strange phrase, <em>ferocious grace</em>. Lindhout&#x2019;s desire&#x2014;her need, even&#x2014;to live on all cylinders burns bright in this book, but Corbett deftly reminds us that even when chipping away at cement, &#x201c;covered in grit and cobwebs,&#x201d; while attempting a desperate escape from her prison, Lindhout is still that unassuming and hopeful girl from Red Deer, Alberta. The one who wrote to her mother from India, &#x201c;I am going to Jodhpur. It is a city in the desert, called the Blue City, as all the buildings are painted blue! I am having the BEST TIME EVER!&#x201d;</p> <p>In fact, it&#x2019;s Lindhout&#x2019;s contradictions that make her such a rich character. She can be na�ve and driven, generous and opportunistic, ambitious and fitful, sometimes all at once. At the same time she&#x2019;s heading for danger, she&#x2019;s making friends. And even after she is taken hostage by an extremist group, and her situation descends into darkness, she finds small measures of beauty and even optimism in her captivity. And within that simple, brutal paradox, Lindhout manages to stay alive.</p> <p>What Lindhout endured during her 460 days in captivity is difficult to absorb, but Corbett is brilliant with the telling detail, and her writing is so strong that she can paint readers a vivid picture with only a few brush strokes.</p> <p><em>A House in the Sky</em> is a true story of a young woman&#x2019;s radical adventures. It is absorbing and inspiring and textured. It is terrifying. It illuminates. It is the best book I have read in a very long time.</p>Amanda Lindhout is the founder of the Global Enrichment Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports development, aid, and education initiatives in Somalia and Kenya.

With the Dragonriders of Pern, McCaffrey has given us more than just an extraordinary masterwork of imagination. She has given us a whole world&#x2014;and has taught us to fly. Now, in this triumphant return to Pern, Anne McCaffrey takes us on an adventure as surprising and unforgettable as any that has come before . . .<br><br>It is a time of hope and regret, of endings and beginnings. The Red Star, that celestial curse whose eccentric orbit was responsible for Thread, has been shifted to a harmless orbit, and the current Threadfall will be the last. Technological marvels are changing the face of life on Pern.

In <i>The Skies of Pern</i>, she confronts her standard cast of characters with the consequences of those solutions, consequences that are a whole new set of problems. Now that the Red Star has been pushed to another orbit, there will only be a few more ravenous Threads descending from it for them and their dragons to fight--and what role will that leave for them? They have successfully reclaimed Earth's lost technology--and suddenly everyone with a craft that might be outmoded, or who is phobic about surgery, is on the rampage, sabotaging and smashing and making up rumors. These fundamentalist Abominators are sure that something terrible will happen if the old ways are not gone back to--and sure enough, fire descends, on cue, from the skies.<p> Anne McCaffrey's tales of genetically engineered dragons and a lost colony that has declined into feudalism are ultimately SF rather than fantasy because they are about finding solutions to problems, solutions that involve working with what you are given to start off with; <i>The Skies of Pern</i> is all about elegant solutions to credible problems. <i>--Amazon.co.uk</i></p>&#x201c;SUPERB STORYTELLING AND ENGAGING CHARACTERS . . .McCaffrey&#x2019;s most popular series takes on a new dimension with the latest installment, as familiar characters feel the weight of their years, giving way to a new generation of humans and their dragon companions.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2013;Library Journal</i> (starred review)<br><br>&#x201c;The continuing evolution of this world is carefully handled and always fascinating. . . .

This new book on Indian self-rule is the most informative that I have seen in my own half-century of reading. Deloria and his co-author focus on John Collier&#x2019;s struggle with both the U.S. Congress and the Indian tribes to develop a New Deal for Indians fifty years ago. It is a blow-by-blow historical account, perhaps unique in the literature, which may be the only way to show the full complexity of American Indian relations with federal and state governments. This makes it possible in two brilliant concluding chapters to clarify current Indian points of view and to build onto initiatives that Indians have already taken to suggest which of these might be most useful for them to pursue. The unheeded message has been clear throughout history, but now we see how&#x2014;if we let Indians do it their own way&#x2014;they might, more quickly than we have imagined, rebuild their communities."

Past books focused on the apparent good guys--"black" magicians who use order-magic (cooling, healing, strengthening) and constantly oppose the White Order of chaos wizards whose talent is fire and dissolution. Young hero Cerryl has a natural bent for chaos, and for him the Whites offer the only game in town. Painfully, he learns about balance: order-magic can be deviously used for destruction, chaos can cleanse and anyway requires order-control if it's not to destroy the user. This moves interestingly away from simplistic "black is good, white is bad" magical color-coding ... but although Cerryl is a decent, ethical white wizard, the Order remains unpleasantly tyrannical--for example, an instant life sentence of slave labor for the equivalent of expired license plates. The magic training is interesting if repetitive (apprentices practice firebolts by zapping blockages in the public sewers), but Modesitt's real story lies in waiting for Cerryl to become a full mage of the Order and perhaps confront its injustices in the massive sequel, <i>Colors of Chaos</i>. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i>"Return to the disciplined and uncompromising world of fantasy.

O&#39;Brien)</h2><p><em>Plague Journal</em> is Michael O'Brien's fourth novel in the <i>Children of the Last Days</i> series. The central character is Nathaniel Delaney, the editor of a small-town newspaper, who is about to face the greatest crisis of his life. As the novel begins, ominous events are taking place throughout North America, but little of it surfaces before the public eye. Set in the not-too-distant future, the story describes a nation that is quietly shifting from a democratic form of government to a form of totalitarianism. Delaney is one of the few voices left in the media who is willing to speak the whole truth about what is happening, and as a result the full force of the government is brought against him. <p>Thus, seeking to protect his children and to salvage what remains of his life, he makes a choice that will alter the future of each member of his family and many other people. As the story progresses he keeps a journal of observations, recording the day-by-day escalation of events, and analyzing the motives of his political opponents with sometimes scathing frankness. More importantly, he begins to keep a "mental record" that develops into a painful process of self-examination. As his world falls apart, he is compelled to see in greater depth the significance of his own assumptions and compromises, his successes and failures. <i>Plague Journal </i>chronicles the struggle of a thoroughly modern man put to the ultimate spiritual and psychological test, a man who in losing himself finds himself.</p></p><p><p>"Why couldn't I put this book down?

Yet, it touches the heart of things in the lives of those whom O'Brien calls "children of the last days."

Schall, S.J.</b> Author, <i>The Order of Things</i><p></p><br><br><p>"More realistic than fantastic, this is a suspenseful tale of a family's heroic struggle to survive in an afflicted world.

A story that is gripping, moving and enlightening."</p><p> --<b>-J. Christopher Corkery</b>, G.K.

The latter three novels are available in Dutton hardcover and Plume paperback editions. Pat Barker lives in Durham, England.When Billy Prior returns to France for the fourth time in September of 1918, it&#39;s like coming home. He does so against everyone&#39;s advice, but when he watches the sun rise slowly after the Battle of Joncourt, he realizes why he couldn&#39;t have stayed back. And mysteriously, so do we. Peter Firth&#39;s reading captures perfectly Barker&#39;s tragic mix of pity and apotheosis. An accomplished British actor, Firth is at once the cynical, but savvy, Prior, the stammering Professor Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), soft-spoken Dr. Rivers, all with transparent ease. His unerring sense of character and tone recreates the bitter irony of that last push in 1918 when so many died so needlessly. For Barker, these last dead, though they sour the trumpet of victory, are war&#39;s only winners. At the end Firth&#39;s silence becomes eloquent. P.E.F. An AUDIOFILE Earphones Award winner.

Lomeli opened his eyes. He was curled up on his side. He felt groggy, raw. He had no idea how long he had been asleep, only that it couldn&#x2019;t have been for more than an hour or two. The sudden remembrance of all he had to do in the coming day passed over him like a wave of nausea, and for a while he lay unable to move. Normally his waking routine was to meditate for fifteen minutes then rise and say his morning prayers. But on this occasion, when at last he managed to summon the will to put his feet to the floor, he went directly into the bathroom and ran a shower as hot as he could bear. The water scourged his back and shoulders. He twisted and turned beneath it and cried out in pain. Afterwards he rubbed away the moisture on the mirror and surveyed with disgust his raw and scalded skin. <i>My body is clay, my good fame a vapour, my end is ashes.</i> <br><br> He felt too tense to breakfast with the others. He stayed in his room, rehearsing his homily and attempting to pray, and left it until the very last minute to go downstairs. <br><br> The lobby was a red sea of cardinals robing for the short procession to St. Peter&#x2019;s. The officials of the Conclave, led by Archbishop Mandorff and Monsignor O&#x2019;Malley, had been allowed back into the hostel to assist; Father Zanetti was waiting at the foot of the stairs to help Lomeli dress. They went into the&nbsp;same waiting room opposite the chapel in which he had met Wo&#x17a;niak the night before. When Zanetti asked him how he had slept, he replied, &#x201c;Very soundly, thank you,&#x201d; and hoped the young priest would not notice the dark circles beneath his eyes and the way his hands shook when he handed him his sermon for safe keeping. He ducked his head into the opening of the thick red chasuble that had been worn by successive Deans of the College over the past twenty years and held out his arms as Zanetti fussed around him like a tailor, straightening and adjusting it. The mantle felt heavy on his shoulders. He prayed silently:<i> Lord, who hast said, My yoke is easy and My burden is light, grant that I may so bear it as to attain Thy grace. Amen. Zanetti stood in front of him and reached up to place upon</i></p><p> Zanetti stood in front of him and reached up to place upon his head the tall mitre of white watered silk. The priest stepped back a pace to check it was correctly aligned, squinted, came forward again and altered it by a millimetre, then walked behind Lomeli and tugged down the ribbons at the back and smoothed them. It felt alarmingly precarious. Finally he gave him the crozier. Lomeli lifted the golden shepherd&#x2019;s crook a couple of times in his left hand, testing the weight. <i>You are not a shepherd</i>, a familiar voice whispered in his head. <i>You are a manager.</i> He had a sudden urge to give it back, to tear off the vestments, to confess himself a fraud and disappear. He smiled and nodded. &#x201c;It feels good,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br> Just before 10 a.m., the cardinals began moving off from the Casa Santa Marta, walking out of the plate-glass doors in pairs, in order of seniority, checked off by O&#x2019;Malley on his clipboard. Lomeli, resting on the crozier, waited with Zanetti and Mandorff beside the reception desk. They had been joined by Mandorff&#x2019;s deputy, the Dean of the Master of Papal Ceremonies, a cheerful, tubby Italian monsignor named Epifano, who would be his chief assistant during the Mass. Lomeli spoke to no one,&nbsp;looked at no one. He was still trying vainly to clear a space in his mind for God. <i>Eternal Trinity, I intend by Your grace to celebrate Mass to Your glory, and for the benefit of all, both living and dead, for whom Christ died, and to apply the ministerial fruit for the choosing of a new Pope . . .</i><br><br> At last they stepped out into the blank November morning. The double file of scarlet-robed cardinals stretched ahead of him across the cobbles towards the Arch of the Bells, where they disappeared into the basilica. Again the helicopter hovered somewhere nearby; again the faint sounds of demonstrators carried on the cold air. Lomeli tried to shut out all distractions, but it was impossible. Every twenty paces stood security men who bowed their heads as he passed and blessed them. He walked with his supporters beneath the arch, across the piazza dedicated to the early martyrs, along the portico of the basilica, through the massive bronze door and into the brilliant illumination of St. Peter&#x2019;s, lit for the television cameras, where a congregation of twenty thousand was waiting. He could hear the chanting of the choir beneath the dome and the vast echoing rustle of the multitude. The procession halted. He kept his eyes fixed straight ahead, willing stillness, conscious of the immense throng standing close-packed all around him&#x2014;nuns and priests and lay clergy, staring at him, whispering, smiling.<br><br><i> Eternal Trinity, I intend by Your grace to celebrate Mass to Your glory . . .</i><br><br> After a couple of minutes, they moved on again, up the wide central aisle of the nave. He glanced from side to side, leaning on the crozier with his left hand, motioning vaguely with his right, conferring his blessing upon the blur of faces. He glimpsed himself on a giant TV screen&#x2014;an erect, elaborately costumed, expressionless figure, walking as if in a trance. Who&nbsp;was this puppet, this hollow man? He felt entirely disembodied, as though he were floating alongside himself.<br><br> At the end of the aisle, where the nave gave on to the cupola of the dome, they had to pause beside Bernini&#x2019;s statue of St. Longinus, close to where the choir was singing, and wait while the last few pairs of cardinals filed up the steps to kiss the central altar and descended again. Only when this elaborate manoeuvre had been completed was Lomeli himself cleared to walk around to the rear of the altar. He bowed towards it. Epifano stepped forward and took away the crozier and gave it to an altar boy. Then he lifted the mitre from Lomeli&#x2019;s head, folded it, and handed it to a second acolyte. Out of habit, Lomeli touched his skullcap to check it was in place.<br><br> Together he and Epifano climbed the seven wide carpeted steps to the altar. Lomeli bowed again and kissed the white cloth. He straightened and rolled back the sleeves of his chasuble as if he were about to wash his hands. He took the silver thurible of burning coals and incense from its bearer and swung it by its chain over the altar&#x2014;seven times on this side, and then, walking round, a separate censing on each of the other three. The sweet-smelling smoke evoked feelings beyond memory. Out of the corner of his eye he saw dark-suited figures moving his throne into position. He gave back the thurible, bowed again and allowed himself to be conducted round to the front of the altar. An altar boy held up the missal, opened to the correct page; another extended a microphone on a pole.<br><br> Once, in his youth, Lomeli had enjoyed a modest fame for the richness of his baritone. But it had become thin with age, like a fine wine left too long. He clasped his hands, closed his eyes for a moment, took a breath, and intoned in a wavering plainsong, amplified around the basilica:<br><br><i> &#x201c;In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti . . .&#x201d; </i><br> And from the colossal congregation arose the murmured sung response: <br><i> &#x201c;Amen.&#x201d; </i><br> He raised his hands in benediction and chanted again, extending the three syllables into half a dozen: <br><i> &#x201c;Pa-a-x vob-i-is.&#x201d; </i><br> And they responded: <br><i> &#x201c;Et cum spiritu tuo.&#x201d; </i><br> He had begun.<br></p><p>Excerpted from&nbsp;<b>Conclave </b>by Robert Harris.

Drawing on her 30 years of experience as a psychotherapist, clinic director, &amp; pioneer in the field of nutritional psychology, Ross presents breakthrough solutions to overcoming depression, anxiety, irritability, stress, &amp; other mood problems that diminish the quality of our lives. The Mood Cure is a comprehensive program that includes the use of brain-building amino acids (which can improve moods in 24 hours) &amp; other surprisingly potent nutrient supplements, plus a diet rich in good mood foods like protein, healthy fats, &amp; key vegetables. The book begins with an individualized Mood-Type Questionnaire.</p><p>Julia Ross is a psychotherapist and director of Recovery Systems, a clinic in California that treats mood, eating and addiction problems with nutrient therapy and biochemical rebalancing. She is one of the most successful and well-known names in nutrient therapy, and lectures at conferences and workshops around the world to share her work. Her first book, The Diet Cure, was an international bestseller.If you're often feeling depressed, anxious, or stressed, you're not alone. We're in a bad-mood epidemic, a hundred times more likely to have significant mood problems than people born a hundred years ago.1 And these problems are on the rise. Adult rates of depression and anxiety have tripled since 1990,2,3 and over 80 percent of those who consult medical doctors today complain of excessive stress.4 Even our children are in trouble, with at least one in ten suffering from significant mood disorders.5 Our mood problems are increasing so fast that, by 2020, they will outrank AIDS, accidents, and violence as the primary causes of early death and disability.6<p>It's clear that our moods are deteriorating at unprecedented rates. What isn't so clear is why. What is this tidal wave of emotional malaise all about? Are our lives so much more unhappy than they were one hundred years ago, or even ten years ago? It's true that we're facing some unprecedented adversity in the twenty-first century. But even if it is the high pressure, or the absence of family support, or the terrorist threat, for example, why are we now so unresponsive to traditionally reliable remedies like long vacations, psychotherapy, and spiritual counsel? Why are we forced to turn more and more to medication for solace?</p><p>In this book, I'm proposing that much of our increasing emotional distress stems from easily correctable malfunctions in our brain and body chemistry-malfunctions that are primarily the result of critical, unmet nutritional needs. More important, I am proposing a complete yet asy-to-implement nutritional repair plan that can actually start to eliminate what I call our "false moods" in twenty-four hours.</p><p><b>true emotions Vs. False Moods</b></p><p>Some negative feelings are unavoidable and even beneficial. They're what I call "true emotions." These true, genuine responses to the real difficulties we encounter in life can be hard to take. They can even be unbearable at times, depending on the kinds of ordeals we face. But they can also be vitally important. True grief moves us through our losses, true fear warns us of danger, true anger can defend us from abuse, and true shame can teach us to grow and change. These true emotions typically pass, or diminish naturally, and even when they get repressed or misdirected, they can usually be relieved through counseling. But when we suffer for no justifiable reason; when the pain of a broken heart doesn't mend like a broken bone; when rest, psychotherapy, prayer, and meditation can make little impact-then we must suspect the emotional impostor, the meaningless biochemical error-the "false mood." Figuring out the difference between false moods and true emotions is the first step in your Mood Cure. Once you've mastered that, you can move on to eliminate the fraudulent feelings, such as depression, anxiety, sadness, and irritability, that are interfering with your natural capacity to enjoy life.</p><p><b>Learning to Spot a False Mood</b></p><p>When your boss cancels a long-scheduled vacation, you may get justifiably angry, and the next day you won't have any trouble remembering what triggered your anger. At other times, you just seem to "snap" when your child forgets to take out the garbage. Later you say, "I don't know what got into me." The first case is a genuine emotion, the second is a definite counterfeit.</p><p>* Thinking of a loved one who has died may make you teary, but if every sentimental TV commercial brings you to tears, you're in the grip of false pain.</p><p>* PMS is notorious for its bad moods. If you're reasonably even-tempered the rest of the month, but become teary and nasty before your period, you're experiencing a clear-cut case of hormonally disrupted emotional balance-a false mood.</p><p>* We all make mistakes and beat ourselves up from time to time. But if you are finding fault with your behavior or appearance almost every day, it's likely that false feelings of low self-esteem are responsible.</p><p>You shouldn't have to live with these kinds of distorted moods on a regular basis. It's like having an engine that sputters, preventing you from having a smooth emotional ride. When your brain's emotional equipment needs a tune-up, you get clues: you don't sleep well, you worry too much, you start feeling overwhelmed, you lose your enthusiasm or your ability to concentrate. You might also start depending on chocolate, wine, or marijuana to get some relief. If you experience these kinds of symptoms frequently, you may have just come to accept them, assuming them simply to be unfortunate features of your basic personality. But chances are you're wrong. Now you have an opportunity to discover your true emotional nature.</p><p><b>The Primary Cause of Your False Moods</b></p><p>Your brain is responsible for most of your feelings, both true and false. In concert with some surprisingly brainlike areas of your heart and gut, it transmits your feelings through four highly specialized and potent kinds of mood molecules. If it has plenty of all four, it keeps you as happy as you can possibly be, given your particular life circumstances. But if your brain runs low on these mood transmitters-whether because of a minor genetic miscue, because it's used them up coping with too much stress, or because you aren't eating the specific foods it needs-it stops producing normal emotions on a consistent basis. Instead, it starts hitting false emotional notes, like a piano out of tune.</p><p>After more than thirty years of intensive, worldwide investigation, most of the false moods and their causes have been identified by one of the fastest-growing fields of science-neuroscience, the field that studies the workings and effects of the brain. Drug companies have been using this information to create products that can give our emotional equipment a quick charge. But that's not the same thing as a real repair job. Fortunately, the emotional tune-up that we need so badly now is readily available. In fact, the repair tools we need for this crucial effort are shockingly simple. They're specific foods and nutrient supplements that are so exactly what the brain needs that they can begin to correct emotional malfunctions in just twenty-four hours.</p><p><b>How I Discovered the Mood Cure</b></p><p>I am the director of a clinic that's been doing nutritional mood repair for over fifteen years, but I've actually been a professional dealing with emotional disorders and mood problems since 1975. Early in my career I worked in residential psychiatric settings; later I worked with individuals and families, led intensive therapy groups and workshops, and ran treatment programs for adults and adolescents with addictions and eating disorders. Now I run my own clinic, Recovery Systems, in Mill Valley, California, just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.</p><p>In 1980, as director of my first counseling program, I began to suspect that poor nutrition was playing a role in the cases that did not respond to our intensive programs of psychotherapy and spiritual support. Our less successful clients were often "emotional eaters." They either consumed lots of cookies, ice cream, chips, and fast food or skipped meals altogether and drank lots of coffee and caffeinated sodas. I started hiring nutritionists to explore the possibility of a food-mood connection, and we soon realized that we were on the brink of a powerful breakthrough. Clients who could be persuaded to eat plenty of protein and fresh vegetables three times a day and avoid caffeine, sweets, and refined starches, like white bread and pasta, felt much better emotionally (as well as physically). When they ate well, even those who had major psychological work to do were able to make steady advances in counseling with much less anguish and backsliding. However, the clients who did not make the nutritional changes-despite new communication skills, exercise, long vacations, and moderate work hours-did not do nearly as well.</p><p>I was encouraged by these results, but I also had to admit that it took the clients who were able to stick with it about ten weeks to fully withdraw from their bad-mood junk foods. For most of them, this was ten weeks of food cravings, fatigue, headaches, and only very slowly diminishing mood swings. More important, too many of our clients just couldn't wait it out and went back to their old junk foods and debilitating moods.</p><p>We needed something more.</p><p><b>The Amazing Aminos</b></p><p>Around this time, in the mid-1980s, I read about the work of neuroscientist Kenneth Blum, Ph.D., at the University of North Texas. A prolific researcher, Dr. Blum was studying the brain chemistry of alcoholics and drug addicts. In the course of this work, he'd identified a few genes that could hardwire the brain to underproduce its most potent "feel good" brain chemicals and instead produce the "feel bad" mood chemistry that made his subjects so vulnerable to addiction. His research explained the perplexing feelings of anxiety, anger, and depression, the chronic insomnia, and the lack of a sense of well-being that plagued so many addicts even in recovery. He called it the "reward deficiency syndrome." This finding was fascinating all by itself, but Dr. Blum made another, even more remarkable discovery. He found that he could override the "bad-mood genes" by giving his research subjects a few supplemental nutrients. These brain foods, called amino acids, are concentrates of common proteins found in food. They were able to jump-start the addicts' genetically misprogrammed brain chemistry and radically improve their moods. The bottom line: The addicts who took the amino acids were able to stay away from drugs and alcohol. Those who took no aminos had four times higher relapse rates!7</p><p>I was very excited after reviewing Dr. Blum's studies. I had a sense that the amino acids were the missing ingredients in my fledgling nutritional therapy program. Since these supplements were identical to nutrients found in food and, unlike drugs, not foreign to the human body, my nutritionists and I felt comfortable recommending them. It was certainly worth a try.</p><p><b>Combining Nutritherapy with Psychotherapy</b></p><p>Early on, I decided to give the aminos to three women struggling with bulimia, an eating disorder that is normally very difficult to treat. When they came to our clinic, all of them had been working hard in psychotherapy for some time with no improvement. Like most bulimics, they were depressed, obsessive, and self-critical. All were professionally well established, though, and all were married. One was a happily married 26-year-old, one was 35 and very unhappily married, and the third, at 48, needed marital help, but she and her husband were both determined to work things out.</p><p>In addition to taking the aminos, these women committed themselves to following our standard program of protein-and-vegetable-rich, reduced-carbohydrate foods and psychotherapy. I was astonished at how the aminos accelerated each client's progress. Mood improvements that would normally have taken months to achieve began for these women in days. In two weeks on the aminos, all three women had freed themselves of their obsessions with food and most of their associated mood problems. And it kept getting better. After a few months on aminos, the happily married woman, having met all of her goals, graduated from therapy free of both bulimia and mood swings. The unhappily married woman began to do deep and productive therapy after years of being too weakened by her bulimia to use psychotherapy constructively. After her nutritional overhaul, she was able to work through her fears, leave her husband, and establish a happy life for herself. The third woman no longer felt much need for individual therapy (she'd been at it for years) but started couples therapy with good results. All three women were still making excellent progress six months later and starting to go off their aminos. Their psychotherapist was dumbfounded, and so were we. More than fifteen years and several thousand clients later, the amino acids are still our most effective weapons for fighting false moods. We have consistently found that they not only improve mood almost instantly, but speed up psychotherapy as well. A well-nourished person who has had a brain chemistry tune-up with amino acids gets beyond psychological and emotional obstacles faster, deeper, and more successfully. Not only have our brain-tuned clients had quicker access to critical memories, but they've coped better with those memories, no longer paralyzed by biochemically exaggerated feelings of fear, guilt, or pain.</p><p>The effects of nutritionally stabilized moods on our clients' relationships have also been extraordinary. I'll never forget the first family that we treated with both psychotherapy and nutritherapy. A father and mother came to see us, concerned about their 14-year-old son, who was having attention problems and depression plus headache pain so severe that it often kept him at home from school. It soon became clear that Dad had some serious problems, too. He was obsessively controlling and verbally abusive. Though they had received family counseling many times in the past, nothing had ever improved. When it became clear, after a few sessions, that Dad was actually deeply devoted to his family but simply unable to control his critical, angry feelings, I suggested that he meet with the same staff nutritionist who was seeing his son. He agreed because he could see that his son's headaches were responding to dietary changes and that his mood and ability to concentrate were improving on the amino acids. When Dad began taking amino acids himself, the change was immediate and powerful: his obsessive, explosive behavior evaporated entirely, much to the amazement and relief of his wife and son. Family therapy proceeded very constructively, since all family members were finally able to listen and respond to one another free of their false moods. Interestingly, Dad also needed some private psychotherapy to adjust to his new emotional style, especially in the business world, where his abrasive personality had become his trademark.</p><p>In 1995, our staff began suggesting that our clients try potentially helpful aminos right in the office, during their initial assessments. As a result, we've actually been present as the amino acids have taken effect, typically within fifteen minutes. We've watched and cheered as hundreds of clients shed their false feelings of tension, lethargy, irritability, and emotional pain right before our eyes. The word that our clients always use to describe this experience is "amazing." What's more, our clients typically need to take the aminos for only three to twelve months. After that, their mood chemistry repairs are usually complete if they continue eating plenty of protein, vegetables, and other fresh whole foods and taking their basic vitamin, mineral, and fatty acid supplements.</p><p><b>How Do the Aminos Eliminate False Moods and Revive True Emotion?</b></p><p>This is the secret: There are twenty-two different kinds of amino acids in high-protein foods like chicken, fish, beef, eggs, and cheese. You may have heard them referred to as the building blocks of protein. Each amino has its own name and unique duties to perform, but only a few very special aminos can serve as fuels for the brain's four ...</p></p><h2>Heretic: Betrayers of Kamigawa: Kamigawa Cycle, Book II</h2><p>The second title in a series that peers into a mysterious new area of the Magic� world.<br> <br> Heretic: Betrayers of Kamigawa continues a series that will explore a new and mysterious area of the Magic: The Gathering world that fans have never seen before.

Why? Because Dennis Rodman, superstar&nbsp;&nbsp;basketball player who joined the Chicago Bulls for the&nbsp;&nbsp;1996 season, has more in common with Mick Jagger&nbsp;&nbsp;than with his new teammate Michael Jordan. With&nbsp;&nbsp;his body-covering tattoos and ever-changing&nbsp;&nbsp;fluorescent hair, Rodman's sideline antics and celebrated&nbsp;&nbsp;benchings have captivated sports fans as much as&nbsp;&nbsp;his record-breaking on-court performances and&nbsp;&nbsp;earned him a reputation as a rebel with the same&nbsp;&nbsp;penchant for shocking behavior as his on-again off-again&nbsp;&nbsp;squeeze, Madonna. In <i>Bad As I Wanna&nbsp;&nbsp;Be</i> he'll share his surprising and candid&nbsp;&nbsp;opinions on everything from fame, money, and race&nbsp;&nbsp;relations, to sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll--and he'll&nbsp;&nbsp;talk about his life, from going to prison for&nbsp;&nbsp;stealing watches to his daughter, the light of his&nbsp;&nbsp;life.<br><br>At a time when most celebrities and&nbsp;&nbsp;professional athletes try to control their public&nbsp;&nbsp;personas like politicians and refrain from&nbsp;&nbsp;expressing their true beliefs, Dennis Rodman is a&nbsp;&nbsp;refreshingly unique, uncompromising individual who both&nbsp;&nbsp;transcends his world and refuses to conform to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Bad As I Wanna Be</i> is as candid,&nbsp;&nbsp;intriguing, and unforgettable as he is.</p><p><b>Dennis Rodman</b> is a seven-time NBA rebounding champion. He earned five NBA championships rings in his 14-year career: 1989 and &#x2019;90 with the Detroit Pistons and 1996, &#x2019;97, and &#x2019;98 with the Chicago Bulls. He has also been named Defensive Player of the Year twice (1990, &#x2019;91); All-NBA Third Team twice (1992, &#x2019;95); All-Defensive First Team seven times (1989-92, &#x2019;93, &#x2019;95, &#x2019;96); and an NBA All-Star twice (1990, &#x2019;92). In 2011, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Rodman is the author of two other books: <i>Bad As I Wanna Be</i> (1994), a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller that reached #1; and <i>Walk on the Wild Side</i> (1997).At that point in her life Madonna was ready to settle down.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was really cool to be around--mellow, low-key, caring.&nbsp;&nbsp;She has this public image of being hard and tough, but underneath that she's a sensitive person.&nbsp;&nbsp;She likes to be held and comforted.<br><br>I wasn't ready to settle down, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;She wanted me to calm down a little and be happier just hanging with her and living a slower lifestyle.<br><br>She used to say, "I've been through that stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been wild and crazy." <b></b><b><i>She wanted me to get through my wild stage, too,</i></b><b></b> but I couldn't just drop everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was still having fun, still looking for new challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to go out on my boat, hang with my friends, but she couldn't do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;If she did, everyone would have gone ballistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b><b><i>She was always looking for places where </i></b><b>she could BE A PERSON and NOT MADONNA,</b><b><i> </i></b><b></b>and that was hard for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn't just come down to Dallas and hang out with me and my friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;They'd be too freaked out, and it would end up being a bad situation.<br><br>I don't have to be hidden behind closed doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;The way I look at it, if people get used to seeing something, pretty soon it's a regular thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before long, seeing me out at a club isn't a big deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to get her to go out, but I think she's pretty much afraid of going out.&nbsp;&nbsp;In her position, there's a little fear about what people might do to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN SOME CRAZY PERSON IS GOING TO START STALKING YOU</b> when you're that high-profile, like that Hoskins guy who said if he couldn't have her he'd slice her throat from ear to ear--the guy her bodyguard shot.&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn't even go out to dinner that easily; there's always the chance people would mob her, swallow her up, and not let her move.<br><br>In a way, it's sad.&nbsp;&nbsp;She's such a prisoner of her fame.&nbsp;&nbsp;She can't do the kinds of things normal people do.&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost everywhere she goes is a big fucking scene.

It wasn't like that at all; it was just very entertaining.<br><br>Everybody thinks she would have the greatest, wildest sex in the world, and every guy wants to sleep with Madonna. I got to where I didn't think of her that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were comfortable together, and the sex was perfectly natural and satisfying.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>SHE WASN'T AN ACROBAT, BUT SHE WASN'T A DEAD FISH EITHER.</b><br><b>I HAVE TO COME CLEAN ON ONE THING:</b> The whole time I was with Madonna, I had a girlfriend named Kim.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was living with me in San Antonio, but the relationship was messed up because I thought she was lying about who she was. She also kept saying she had all this money.&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out she was feeding me a bunch of lies and that made it easier for me to see Madonna with a clear conscience.<br><br>Kim knew I was seeing Madonna, and that caused some problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew our relationship was dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw all those faxes and letters from Madonna.&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew I was talking to Madonna all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;We broke up, and I started seeing Madonna more.<br><br>After we broke up, I took Kim to Las Vegas.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to go to Las Vegas, and I didn't want go by myself so I took Kim.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first night we're there, Madonna's assistant comes up to me at the craps tables and says, <b></b><b><i>"There's someone who wants to see you upstairs."</i></b><b></b> She didn't normally travel with an entourage, but she brought it along this time.<br><br>I'm thinking, Oh, God.&nbsp;&nbsp;And <b>MADONNA WAS RIGHT THERE.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;She tracked me down in Las Vegas.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm there with Kim, and Madonna found out and followed me. She was not only there, but she was <b>IN THE ROOM </b><b><i>RIGHT NEXT DOOR.</i></b><b> </b> She found out what room I was in and got herself hooked up with the one next to it.<br><br>Madonna knew I loved Las Vegas, and when she found out I'd left San Antonio, she went to Las Vegas.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess anybody could do that with me, because I'm pretty predictable that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I go party, I go to Las Vegas.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I go to Las Vegas, I stay at the Mirage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Madonna figured that out, then found out what room I was in and got the one next door.&nbsp;&nbsp;I told you--she's one woman who knows what she wants and knows how to get it.<br><br>So after Madonna's assistant got me, I left the table--by myself--and went to see Madonna.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were in the stairwell, and she was saying, <b>"YOU LOVE ME. YOU WANT TO BE WITH ME.&nbsp;&nbsp;LEAVE WITH ME RIGHT NOW AND FORGET YOUR GIRLFRIEND."</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;So what did I do? I think obviously I did the right thing by going and getting my shit and leaving with Madonna.&nbsp;&nbsp;We got on a plane and went back to her house in Los Angeles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim got home okay, but there wasn't much left of our relationship after that.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br><br><b>From </b><b><i>Bad As I Wanna Be</i></b><b></b><br><br>Fifty percent of life in the NBA is sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other fifty percent is money....<br><br>On an April night in 1993 I sat in the cab of my pickup truck with a rifle in my lap, deciding whether to kill myself....<br><br>Madonna looked at me all sexy and said, "You're staying with me, in my room."...<br><br>I don't expect Scottie Pippen to forgive me for what I did to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't expect him to forget about it either....<br><br>I've been homeless.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've worked at 7-Eleven.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a real person, with real experiences, not some image that somebody in the NBA office created....<br><br>When you talk about race in basketball, the whole thing is simple: a black player knows he can go out on the court and kick a white player's ass....<br><br>I used to go through the whole routine--dress up, wear makeup, act like a girl....<br><br>Those guys in San Antonio can kiss my ass, especially Gregg Popovich, the general manager...<br><br>Popovich wanted to be the guy who tamed Dennis Rodman....<br><br>I knew I would have been just another nigger if I didn't play basketball....<br><br>How much do you really want to win when you have as much money, attention, and fame as Shaquille O'Neal does?...White women get into relationships with black men because they think the sex is going to be better....<br><br>As long as I play ball, I can get any woman I want.&nbsp;&nbsp;But there's no scoreboard in my bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilt Chamberlain lied when he said he had 20,000 women.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilt should open his own sperm bank....<br><br>I can go out to a salon and have my nails painted pink, and then go out and play in the NBA, on national television, with pink nails....<br><br>I wanted to be white because I was black, and black was never the right color....<br><br>I see Chris Dudley, Derrick Coleman, Dale Davis, and Anthony Mason making huge money, and I see injustice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who buys a ticket to see these guys play?...<br><br>I left the table--by myself--and went to see Madonna.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were in a stairwell, and she was saying, "You love me.&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to be with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave with me right now and forget your girlfriend."...<br><br>If I die young, everybody's going to say they saw it coming....<br><br>The Spurs might be more of a basketball team if David Robinson didn't freeze up every time they play a big game....<br><br>Whenever someone would ask Phil Jackson if anything I've done surprised him, he would always say, "Yeah, it surprised me that he needs a special tool to take his pressurized earrings out."...<br><br>You're going to have to find a way to stop me on your own, bro, and nobody's found it yet.</p><h2>Poyln: Jewish Life in the Old Country</h2><p>Never-before-published, luminous photographs of Polish Jewish life in the 1920s by an undiscovered master.<br><br>In 1921, photographer Alter Kacyzne was commissioned by the New York Yiddish daily, the Forverts, to document images of Jewish life in "the old country."

Based on her extensive experience as a&nbsp;&nbsp;therapist treating Jewish survivors of the Holocaust and&nbsp;&nbsp;those who helped them, Fogelman delves into the&nbsp;&nbsp;psychology of altruism,illuminating why these&nbsp;&nbsp;rescuers chose to act while others simply stood by.&nbsp;&nbsp;While analyzing motivations, <i>Conscience And&nbsp;&nbsp;Courage</i> tells the stories of such&nbsp;&nbsp;little-known individuals as Stefnaia Podgorska&nbsp;&nbsp;Burzminska, a Polish teenager who hid thirteen Jews in her&nbsp;&nbsp;home; Alexander Roslan, a dealer in the black&nbsp;&nbsp;market who kept uprooting his family to shelter three&nbsp;&nbsp;Jewish children in his care, as well as more&nbsp;&nbsp;heralded individuals such as Oskar Schindler, Raoul&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallenberg, ad Miep Gies. Speaking to the same&nbsp;&nbsp;audience that flocked to Steven Spielberg's Academy&nbsp;&nbsp;Award-winning movie, <i>Schindler's&nbsp;&nbsp;List</i>, <i>Conscience And Courage</i> is the&nbsp;&nbsp;first book to go beyond the stories to answer the&nbsp;&nbsp;question: Why did they&nbsp;&nbsp;help?</p><p>"Fogelman has made a monor contribution to Holocaust studies in collcting these accounts of conscience and courage." --<i>The Washington Post Book World.</i> <br>"By evoking the noble along with the horrible, Ms. Fogelman helps to add a dimension to our understanding of the Holocaust. And, more than that, hers is a work of remembrance." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>Fogelman's survey of heroic subversion of the Nazi genocide of the Jews by non-Jews begins with the story of her own father, Simcha Fogelman, rescued by a Russian baker in the Byelorussian town of Illya in 1942. The odd thing about many of these rescuers- -like the currently famous Oskar Schindler or Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenburg--is that they were frequently notorious rakes, thieves, and embezzlers--in other words, outright criminals. Fogelman (Center for Social Research/CUNY) tries in this ample study to understand the particular background and conditioning that produces a ``rescuer'' as opposed to either a passive bystander or an active accessory. And an extraordinary gallery of characters is brought to life: Angel Sanz-Briz, the Spanish minister in Budapest who issued thousands of phony Spanish passports to Hungarian Jews; Miep Gies, the rescuer--for a time--of Anne Frank; Stefaniz Podgorska, a teenage girl who smuggled food into the ghetto of Przemysl and hid refugees from it; Alexander Roslan, who built a hiding cupboard in his apartment and when visited by suspicious Gestapo agents wined and dined them until they were too drunk to remember why they had come; Louisa Steenstra, a former secretary at a Jewish-owned furniture factory in Groningen who ventured into the local concentration camp to get a suitcase of clothes to a Jewish friend. Perhaps one of the strangest stories is that of the Japanese consul in Kovno, Lithuania, Sempo Sugihara, who ignored his diplomatic instructions and issued illegal transit visas to Jews via Japan--visas that his own government kept refusing to validate. At the end of each day, his hands would be so numb from writing these fake visas that his wife would have to massage them back to life. It is estimated that he saved between 4,500 and 10,000 Jews. Perhaps inexplicable but uplifting stories of humanity. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Ted now lives and works in the brownstone he shares with his wife and their two cats in Brooklyn, New York. www.tedlewin.com.Grade 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;This stunningly crafted tale, written in the language of the storyteller, realistically pictures, in both words and paintings, the phenomenon that is the winter solstice. ("The snow lies deep./The night is long and long./The stars are ice, the moon is frost,/and all the world is still.") Although the characters in the almost poetic text are animals&#x2014;crow, moose, fox&#x2014;they express the apprehension felt by ancient peoples as they anxiously awaited the sun's return following the longest night of the year. Amid the snow, darkness, and bitter wind, each of the creatures boasts that it will get the sun to return, but the wind replies, "Not you,...Not you." Surprisingly, the wind chooses the tiny chickadee to wake the slumbering sun with her cheery song&#x2014;"Dee-dee-dee." "And with the song/of one small bird/and the sun's answering smile/the journey toward spring/begins." There is plenty of moonlight in Lewin's watercolor paintings created with just blue, brown, and green. Double-page close-ups of a sleeping, moonlit bear surrounded by tiny snoozing field mice; the soft, knowing eyes of the antlered moose; the vicious snarl of the heavily whiskered fox; and the larger-than-life chickadee all create the feeling that you, the observer, are standing close at hand, a participant in this annual ritual of nature.&#x2014;<i>Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i> END</p><h2>Big Brush Watercolor</h2><p>Using the Japanese hake brush, obtainable from most art and craft shops, Ron Ranson demonstrates how, because of its nature and size, it forces the watercolourist to simplify the subject matter and thus distil the essence of a scene.

Yet, so often we settle for mediocrity when greatness is within our grasp.<br><br>Why are we drawn to stories of heroic triumph over seemingly impossible circumstances? In our fascination with adventure movies, superheroes, and tales of incredible human feats, do we reveal an inherent desire for something larger and greater in life?

Here is the roadmap for your journey of transformation. You are marked for a life that far surpasses the usual definitions of success or fulfillment.<br><br>Isn&#x2019;t it time to pursue your extraordinary life?</p><p>Marked by boldness and passion, <b>John Bevere</b> delivers uncompromising truth through his award-winning curriculum and best-selling books, including <i>The Bait of Satan, Drawing Near, </i>and<i> Driven by Eternity</i>, now available in over sixty languages.

These words paint a picture of an unimaginable and extraordinary existence, one far beyond what any mere mortal has known or experienced. You may have heard these words before and related them only to heaven&#x2019;s glory. But in actuality, they were penned for the here and now! For the writer, the apostle Paul, continues, &#x201c;But we know these things because God has revealed them to us by his Spirit&#x201d; (verse 10, NLT).<br>Paul, who lived during the church&#x2019;s inception, was divinely moved to bring into the open what had been previously hidden to our eyes, ears, and imagination. He also wrote the following to describe the mandate of his life: My task is to bring out in the open and make plain what God, who created all this in the first place, has been doing in secret and behind the scenes all along. Through followers of Jesus like yourselves gathered in churches, this <i>extraordinary </i>plan of God is becoming known and talked about even among the angels! (Ephesians 3:9&#x2013;10, MSG)<br>There&#x2019;s One Person above all others who desires an extraordinary life for you. He is a Father who delights, like any good father, in the achievements and happiness of His children. His name is God! And nothing will please Him more than seeing you reach your highest potential. God&#x2019;s extraordinary plan is revealed when we live extraordinarily. Together let&#x2019;s give the angels something to talk about!<br><i>Extraordinary. </i>Just hearing this amazing word arouses the desire to surpass the norm, to break away from the status quo. Its definition is &#x201c;beyond what is usual, exceptional, exceeding the common measure.&#x201d; One-word synonyms include <i>remarkable, amazing, marvelous, </i>and <i>unimaginable. </i>To better understand the full meaning of this inspiring word, consider its antonyms: <i>common, normal, </i>and <i>usual.<br></i>Ponder this a moment: the opposite of extraordinary is <i>normal </i>! If we&#x2019;re honest, I think we all want our lives to mean more or be more than what we&#x2019;ve known and seen. Unless it&#x2019;s suppressed, there is an innate desire in each of us to rise above commonness. We yearn for the extraordinary.<br>The most loved popular films that have captured the hearts and attention of the public involve extraordinary powers. There&#x2019;s <i>Spider-Man, Superman, The Incredible Hulk, </i>the Star Wars saga, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia, The Matrix, Fantastic Four, The Incredibles, X-Men, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean, </i>and that&#x2019;s not all of them. Add to this mix the movies with extraordinary heroes who do remarkable feats and live exceptional lives, characters such as Batman, Iron Man, Indiana Jones, Zorro, William Wallace, Robin Hood, Spartacus, Sergeant York, just to name a few. In fact, as of 2009, seventeen of the top twenty-five all-time blockbuster movies fall under these categories. That&#x2019;s almost 70 percent, and the percentage varies only slightly if you extend the poll to the top fifty.<br>How intriguing that the bulk of the most popular movies of all time are not love stories, murder mysteries, espionage thrillers, war movies, true life accounts, sports flicks, westerns, police stories, or dramas of friendship, family, or life in general. No, the top box office draws are films that center on extraordinary characters doing remarkable feats, with a good number of them possessing beyond-human abilities or powers. Why? Because &#x201c;extraordinary&#x201d; is how we were created to live. It was God&#x2019;s plan from the beginning.<br>Unfortunately, God&#x2019;s plan and man&#x2019;s execution of the plan are often not the same. One of the main reasons I avoided Christianity for years was its portrayal. I, like so many others, saw men of God as Bible-thumping critics who were quick to judge the flaws of others. Or they were passive, backward, and ignorant. The idea that Christians were pioneers who lived and thought outside the box, behaving in extraordinary ways, never crossed my mind. And the idea of Christian women? Well, it was even worse. I perceived that they had no say in important matters, dressed unfashionably, and neglected their appearance. It was frowned upon for a godly woman to venture beyond her domestic duties and certainly unheard of for her to lead in any way. As a young man, I didn&#x2019;t want my wife forbidden to think and restricted from joining me in life&#x2019;s ventures. I didn&#x2019;t want a woman who was suppressed&#x2014;I wanted one full of life! I viewed Christianity as lifeless. Becoming a believer would mean losing my individuality and forgoing creativity, excellence, passion, and the ability to succeed in the marketplace, sports, politics, education, and other arenas of life. I didn&#x2019;t know it then, but my views were the opposite of how God created us to live, because He is the One who breathed into us the desire for the extraordinary. Listen to God Himself: God spoke: &#x201c;Let us make human beings in our image, make them<br>reflecting our nature So they can be responsible for the fish in the sea, the birds in the air, the cattle,<br>And, yes, Earth itself, and every animal that moves on the face of Earth.&#x201d; God created human beings;<br>he created them godlike, Reflecting God&#x2019;s nature. He created them male and female. God blessed them:<br>&#x201c;Prosper! Reproduce! Fill Earth! Take charge!&#x201d; (Genesis 1:26&#x2013;28, MSG) We were made to reflect God&#x2019;s nature. He spoke both to men and women, saying, &#x201c;Prosper! Reproduce! Fill the Earth! Take charge!&#x201d; Adam, the first man, named every species of animal on the earth (I&#x2019;m sure his wife would have been involved, but she hadn&#x2019;t been created yet!). God brought the animals to Adam and gave him the responsibility of naming them. There are over one million species of animals on earth. Not only did Adam have the creativity to name them all, but he also had the capacity to remember each one. That was an extraordinary man doing a remarkable feat!<br>You may ask, &#x201c;But since Adam fell, weren&#x2019;t those abilities lost due to his disobedience?&#x201d; No, Jesus flipped the mess Adam created for humankind. Paul wrote, &#x201c;Here it is in a nutshell: Just as one person did it wrong and got us in all this trouble with sin and death, another person did it right and got us out of it. But more than just getting us out of trouble, he got us into <i>life</i>!&#x201d; (Romans 5:18, MSG). The word <i>life </i>doesn&#x2019;t merely describe the way we&#x2019;ll live in heaven; it also means the &#x201c;here and now.&#x201d; Jesus not only recovered what Adam lost, but He also provided so much more&#x2014;the potential of an extraordinary life! The truth is, <i>God not only desires you to live extraordinarily but also has equipped you to do so. </i>Don&#x2019;t ever forget these words. Etch them on the tablet of your heart. A remarkable, amazing, extraordinary life is not restricted to certain individuals or professions. It doesn&#x2019;t matter who you are or how you serve in life. If you&#x2019;re a schoolteacher, businessperson, government leader, stay-at-home mom, athlete, factory worker, hairstylist, student, pastor (the list is endless), it doesn&#x2019;t matter, because you were created for extraordinary achievements in that role. The power to accomplish remarkable feats and live an exceptional life is not tied to an occupation but to a disposition of the heart. This is not only God&#x2019;s will but also His great pleasure.<br>Hollywood, religious people, and our culture had painted for me a warped and limited image of God&#x2019;s people. Why did I have this distortion? God, you, and I have a common enemy named Satan, who is called &#x201c;the ruler of this world,&#x201d; &#x201c;the prince of the power of the air,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the god of this world.&#x201d;He controls the world&#x2019;s systems and influences the minds of those who do not belong to God. He has billions of fallen angels and demons to carry out his grand strategy. The sad fact is that too often the church has limited Satan&#x2019;s chief strategy to certain behaviors, like trying to get people to drink alcohol or watch dirty sex scenes in movies. He&#x2019;s much more crafty than that and uses a wide variety of snares and diversions. We&#x2019;ve missed his primary purpose. Because what he fears most is Christians discovering who God&#x2019;s made them to be&#x2014;extraordinary people with abilities to carry out remarkable and unusual feats. This should be the image society has of Christians. In contrast to the present reputation of Christians, one of the great struggles the early church encountered was convincing people that believers were not superheroes or gods. Cornelius, an officer in the most powerful army in the world, bowed down to worship Peter and his companions. Stunned, Peter immediately replied, &#x201c;Stand up; I myself am also a man&#x201d; (Acts 10:26).<br>In a city named Lystra, the mob &#x201c;went wild, calling out in their Lyconian dialect, &#x2018;The gods have come down! These men are gods!&#x2019;&#x201d; Paul sharply corrected them: &#x201c;What do you think you&#x2019;re doing! We&#x2019;re not gods!&#x201d; (Acts 14:11, 14, MSG). When Paul was on Malta collecting firewood, a poisonous snake bit him. He shook it off, and the inhabitants anticipated his death. &#x201c;But when it was obvious he wasn&#x2019;t going to, they jumped to the conclusion that he was a god!&#x201d; (28:6, MSG). Unbelievers said of the early church, &#x201c;These who have turned the world upside down have come here too&#x201d; (17:6). Christians were held in high esteem by their society. It&#x2019;s recorded the entire city of Jerusalem&#x2019;s attitude toward the church was that &#x201c;everyone had high regard for them&#x201d; (5:13, NLT). In our generation may we each live in such a way to recover that kind of respect for the church.<br><br><b>A Journey<br></b>In the pages that follow, we will embark on a journey to fully understand the extraordinary way...</p><h2>Alice in the Country of Hearts, Vol. 4</h2><p>Used.

Later I realized how comprehensive this is&#x2013; how to keep your bases covered while thinking about the big picture. It&#x2019;s good advice no matter what your business or lifestyle.<br></i>&#x2013;DJT<br><br>A lot has happened to us all since 1987.

I realized that after seventeen years they still rang true. I could have written these words yesterday: <br><br>First paragraph: <i>I don&#x2019;t do it for the money. I&#x2019;ve got enough, much</i> <i>more than I&#x2019;ll ever need. I do it to do it. Deals are my art form. Other people</i> <i>paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry.

You ask a baker how he makes bread. You ask a billionaire how he makes money.<br><br>Sure, there have been countless how-to-get-rich books written by millionaires.

After you make your first billion, don&#x2019;t forget to send me a thank-you note. You know the address.<br><br><b>PART I<br>The Donald J. Trump School of Business and Management<br></b><br><b>Be a General<br></b><br>I am the chairman and president of The Trump Organization. I like saying that because it means a great deal to me. There are almost twenty thousand members of this organization at this point. I did a<br>print ad once in which I declared, &#x201c;I only work with the best.&#x201d; That statement still stands.<br><br>More and more, I see that running a business is like being a general. Calling the shots carries a great deal of responsibility, not only for yourself, but for your troops. Your employees&#x2019; lives, to a large extent, are dependent on you and your decisions. Bad strategy can end up affecting a lot of people. <br>This is where being a leader takes on a new dimension. Every decision you make is an important<br>one, whether there are twenty thousand people working for you or just one.<br><br>If you are careful when finding employees, management becomes a lot easier. I rely on a few key people to keep me informed. They know I trust them, and they do their best to keep that trust intact.<br>For example, when I need to know something about my casinos and hotels in Atlantic City, I know I can call up Mark Brown, my CEO, and get a fast and informed answer. If I call Laura Cordovano over at Trump Park Avenue and ask about sales, she&#x2019;ll give it to me exactly as it is. If I call Allen Weisselberg, my CFO, he&#x2019;ll tell me what I need to know in twenty words or less. My senior counsel and <i>Apprentice</i> adviser, George Ross, can do it in ten words or less. Find people who suit your business style and you&#x2019;ll have fewer problems to deal with as time goes on.<br><br>Good people equals good management and good management equals good people. They have to work together or they won&#x2019;t work together for very long. I&#x2019;ve seen good management get by with mediocre people, and I&#x2019;ve also seen excellent people get stuck in the mires of bad management. The good managers will eventually leave, followed by the good workers, and you will be left with a team that<br>gets along because they&#x2019;re all mediocre. Save yourself time by getting the best people you can. Sometimes this can mean choosing attitude over experience and credentials. Use your creativity to come up with a good mix.<br><br>Creative people rarely need to be motivated&#x2013;they have their own inner drive that refuses to be bored. They refuse to be complacent. They live on the edge, which is precisely what is needed to be successful and remain successful.<br><br>One of my former employees was in charge of a new project. He had done a thorough and acceptable job, but I felt that something was missing. It wasn&#x2019;t <i>fantastic, </i>which, knowing his capabilities, it should have been. I decided to challenge his creative ego by mentioning that it was fine but seemed to lack inspiration. I politely asked him whether he was genuinely interested in the project and suggested that perhaps that might be the problem.<br><br>Well, the guy went ballistic on me. He was deeply insulted. And, as you can probably guess, the revision he turned in was terrific. The difference between the first draft and the final version was<br>incredible. I didn&#x2019;t slam the guy because he was usually demanding of himself and had never let me down. But I had to give him a jolt.<br><br>Generals motivate their soldiers; they inspire them when it is necessary. They do the same for their highest-ranking officers. We all need a boost now and then.

This can seem like a balancing act, but it is absolutely necessary for success in running a company.<br><br>In the 1980s, I was riding high. After learning the essentials of real estate development from my father, Fred, a builder in Queens and Brooklyn, I&#x2019;d become a major player in Manhattan, developing Trump Tower, the Grand Hyatt Hotel, and many other top-tier properties. I had a yacht, a plane, a bestselling book.<br><br>One magazine headline said, EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES TURNS TO GOLD, and I believed it. I&#x2019;d never known adversity. I went straight from Wharton to wealth. Even in down markets, I bought properties<br>inexpensively and made a lot of money. I began to think it was easy.<br><br>In the late eighties, I lost focus. I&#x2019;d fly off to Europe to attend fashion shows, and I wasn&#x2019;t looking at the clothing. My lack of attention was killing my business.<br><br>Then, the real estate market crashed. I owed billions upon billions of dollars&#x2013;$9.2 billion, to be exact. That&#x2019;s nine billion, two hundred million dollars. I&#x2019;ve told this story many times before, but it bears repeating: In the midst of the crash, I passed a beggar on the street and realized he was worth $9.2 billion more than I was. I saw a lot of my friends go bankrupt, never to be heard from again.<br><br><b>Stay Focused<br></b>The media had me for lunch<i>. Forbes, BusinessWeek, Fortune, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times&#x2013;</i>they all published major stories<i> </i>about my crisis, and a lot of people seemed to be happy about it.<i> <br><br></i>I&#x2019;ll never forget the worst moment. It was 3 A.M. Citibank phoned<i> </i>me at my home in Trump Tower. They wanted me to come over to<i> </i>their office immediately to negotiate new terms with some foreign<i><br></i>banks&#x2013;three of the ninety-nine banks to whom I owed billions. It&#x2019;s tough when you have to tell a banker that you can&#x2019;t pay interest. They tend not to like those words. An ally at Citibank suggested<br>that the best way for me to handle this difficult situation was to call the banks myself, and that&#x2019;s exactly what they wanted me to do, at three o&#x2019;clock on a cold January morning, in the freezing rain. There were no cabs, so I walked fifteen blocks to Citibank. By the time I got there, I was drenched.<br><br>That was the low point. There were thirty bankers sitting around a big table. I phoned one Japanese banker, then an Austrian banker, and then a third banker from a country I can no longer remember.<br>In <i>The Art of the Deal, </i>I had warned readers never to personally guarantee anything. Well, I hadn&#x2019;t followed my own advice. Of the $9.2 billion I owed, I&#x2019;d personally guaranteed a billion dollars. I was a schmuck, but I was a lucky schmuck, and I wound up dealing with some understanding bankers who worked out a fair deal. After being the king of the eighties, I survived the early nineties, and by the mid-to-late nineties, I was thriving again.<br><br>But I learned my lesson.

She lives in New York City.Engaging, in-depth study of how Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities was transferred from megahit book to megaflop movie; by the film critic of The Wall Street Journal, novelist of White Lies (1987). With an okay from Brian de Palma, Bonfire's director, Salamon jumped on board early, when only Tom Hanks had been hired to play Sherman McCoy. She charts the movie's birth pains, financing, script revisions, casting, location-scouting in the Bronx and Manhattan, the New York shoot and the Los Angeles shoot, second unit work for backgrounds not directed by de Palma, editing, sound mixing, scoring, previews around L.A. and in Boston, reediting, advertising, premiere, and reviews. Salamon keeps a steady interest both in the artisans and the mechanics of their art without ever quite finding a voice of her own (say, like Pauline Kael's) or revealing how her presence on the scene may have affected anything. ``The devil's candy'' is a phrase from Peter Guber, the movie's original producer, which means both the actress to be cast as Sherman's mistress and the orgasm of instant success, as in E.T. or Batman. The book's embattled center is de Palma, who is rescued from his ghoulish image in suspense films, and would be the book's tragic hero were the abortive film a tragedy instead of a creative misfire from the first script and first compromise onward. Even so, this movie struck its makers as ``the definitive vehicle of dreams...the stretch limo of hopes and ambition.'' Stephen Spielberg's take on what happened is right on target: ``Brian is stepping into shoes that can be worn by other film makers. When he does that he's caught up in the machinery of the studio system.'' Like watching a World Trade Center tower topple onto Wall Street.

Our barn cats, Rage and Fury, came scratching and begging for entrance, and when I answered the door, they flew past me and disappeared inside. Those old cats weren&#x2019;t scared of much but when a real thunder thumper was bearing down on us, they seemed to prefer the doubtful safety of my dented old trailer to their sturdy barn. Since I was suspicious of mice under my refrigerator, they were welcome. &#x201c;Just hold it down, boys,&#x201d; I admonished them. &#x201c;This old cowboy needs his sleep.&#x201d; Which, because of the time of the year, was the unvarnished truth.</p><p>Since the heifers had started dropping their calves in March, sleep was a precious thing on the Square C and I sure didn&#x2019;t plan on losing any shut-eye over bad weather, especially since there wasn&#x2019;t a thing I could do about it. I shooed the cats off my bunk and climbed under the covers, intent on proving that old saw that cowboys could sleep through anything but a stampede.</p><p>The storm hit us around midnight with a flash of lightning and a mighty rumble of thunder. Then came the rain with a steady rattle on the skin of my metallic domicile while more heavenly electricity flew through the air. The next boom of thunder shook the trailer so hard, the door on my little micro wave oven flew open. Rage and Fury jumped up on my bed and hissed at me like it was my fault Montana was trying to kill us. I yelled at the cats and they slunk off while I pulled the covers over my head, doing my best to ignore the storm, which kept banging away. I might have succeeded except the vision of a small, black angus heifer formed in my mind. Some bull had nailed her late when we weren&#x2019;t looking and she was about to drop her calf. My boss lady had advised me to keep a sharp lookout for trouble. &#x201c;Every two hours on this one, Mike,&#x201d; Jeanette Coulter had commanded. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s got a small pelvis and that looks to be a big calf.&#x201d;</p><p>Lying there beneath the covers, all nice and cozy, I realized I had failed to check on that little heifer even once, mainly because I&#x2019;d spent the day focused on Jeanette&#x2019;s pride and joy, a John Deere tractor, which had thrown a cog. I took an entire minute trying to talk myself out of getting up, but I finally gave in. That almost-mama might be out there in awful pain. I had to check on her, storm or no storm.</p><p>The cats watched me from atop the refrigerator while I pulled on my rubber boots and slung on my yellow slicker. &#x201c;Hold down the fort, boys,&#x201d; I said, then pushed out into the howling rain and wind. My trailer was slanted down a dirt road about a quarter mile from the main house so by the time I got to what we call the turnaround, I was muddy to my knees, soaked to the bone, and generally miserable. Another way of putting that, I was a cowboy ready to go to work.</p><p>I headed over to the holding pen with my fingers crossed that all was well. But it wasn&#x2019;t. In fact, it was a pretty desperate situation. I allowed myself the pleasure of a string of fine curses, then headed to the house, pounding on the door and yelling for Jeanette to get up. Her bedroom window scraped open and I stepped back off the porch. &#x201c;What the devil do you, want, Mike?&#x201d; she called.</p><p>I only had a moment, in a flash of lightning, to see that she was naked as a jay. Her breasts were a wondrous sight, even as I stood in the mud of the yard, rain flowing off the curl of my hat like water out of a pitcher. The lightning flash died and before the thunder reached us, I collected myself and yelled, &#x201c;That little heifer in the pen, her calf&#x2019;s stuck!&#x201d;</p><p>A bolt from above lit everything up again, and I saw her mixed expression of anger and disappointment. I knew what she was thinking. I should have caught this earlier and she was right. &#x201c;Chains do?&#x201d; she demanded.</p><p>She was referring to the chain-and-pulley system in our barn that we used to pull a stuck calf out. I waited for another rumble of thunder to finish, then yelled up the bad news, &#x201c;Gotta cut her, I think.&#x201d;</p><p>Jeanette stared at me for a long second, then said, &#x201c;All right, Mike. Get her in the surgery,&#x201d; and then slammed shut the window, cutting off the finest view I&#x2019;d had of her in the ten years I&#x2019;d worked on the Square C.</p><p>I headed for the holding pen. By then, the heifer was down in the mud, breathing hard. My heart went out to her, poor thing. She had always been an outsider to the herd, standing alone most of the time, feeding on the hay left over after the other cows had their fill. Now she was in trouble, big trouble, her calf jammed in her birth canal, a situation, which would kill them both if we didn&#x2019;t do something about it damn quick.</p><p>I heard Ray Coulter calling my name. Ray&#x2019;s a good kid. Seventeen years old, tall like his daddy with fine features like his mother, smart as paint and a hard worker, too. There aren&#x2019;t too many places left where they make them like our local boys and girls. By the time they&#x2019;re eight years old, they can ride a horse and drive a tractor, crack open the block of a truck engine, and shoot a rifle or a handgun and hit what they&#x2019;re aiming at. They respect their elders, too, even when we don&#x2019;t deserve it.</p><p>&#x201c;Over here, Ray,&#x201d; I called back.</p><p>Before he could get to me, Ray slipped in the cold wet swamp of the holding pen and went down hard in the mud and manure. If that had happened to me, I&#x2019;d have turned the air blue with some elaborate cussing, but not Ray. He just picked himself up and made his way on over. Like I said, a good kid. A ranch kid.</p><p>By then, it was a wild scene in the corral, the rain roaring and the thunder hammering and the lightning strobing us in stuttering blue-white flashes. &#x201c;Help me get her up!&#x201d; I yelled, trying not to sound too hysterical. Together, we grappled with the heifer, both of us going down a couple of times before we finally got her on her feet. She stood there trembling, her mouth foamy with drool, her eyes rolling, and her nose flared. All bad signs. Then she started to moan. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s trying to push her calf out,&#x201d; Ray said.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, she can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t think chains are gonna work, either.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A C-section, Mike?&#x201d; I saw his eyes light up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen one of those!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, Ray, I think tonight&#x2019;s your lucky night. Your mom&#x2019;s probably already waiting for us.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray and I pushed and pulled the heifer through the double doors that led to the surgery, then clamped her neck in a steel rail catch. This, of course, didn&#x2019;t make her happy, and she rattled the walls with panicky squalls. I kept talking soothing cow talk to her but she wasn&#x2019;t much consoled. Cows are smart. She was in trouble, she knew it, and she doubted a couple of idiots like me and Ray were going to get her out of it. Truth was we couldn&#x2019;t. Only Jeanette could and the operation she was about to perform in that cold, concrete room didn&#x2019;t allow much error. I didn&#x2019;t know another rancher in Fillmore County who would attempt what she was about to do. But then, they&#x2019;re not Jeanette Coulter.</p><p>Jeanette was in her green scrubs. She finished washing at the sink and gave me and Ray the once-over. &#x201c;Well? I can&#x2019;t do a thing, you two covered in gumbo and cow shit! Get yourself over to the sink and wash up!&#x201d;</p><p>Ray and I slunk past her, stripped off our rain gear and shirts, scrubbed our hands, faces, and upper torsos, then pulled on clean white T-shirts that were kept in a cabinet beside the sink for just that purpose. Jeanette watched us, then said, &#x201c;Not that I don&#x2019;t trust you, Mike, but we&#x2019;re gonna check this little mama before I cut her. Ray, you do it.&#x201d;</p><p>I confess I was grateful that she&#x2019;d picked Ray over me. Pushing my hand up inside an expectant mama cow isn&#x2019;t exactly my favorite thing to do. But Ray smiled like his mom had done him a favor, got out the K-Y, and ran his arm up to his shoulder.</p><p>When Ray did his duty, I made certain I was a good piece away from that heifer&#x2019;s head. I saw a cowboy lean in close to a cow&#x2019;s head one time, just to scratch her ears while the vet was inserting his hand in the other end, and he got his clock cleaned for his trouble. Three cowboy teeth went flying and everybody, including the vet, laughed out loud. Even the cowboy grinned, showing the big, bloody gap in his teeth. &#x201c;You gonna buy me thum new teeth, bossth?&#x201d; he asked before spitting blood. The boss rancher provided a long stare at his employee before replying &#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; and he didn&#x2019;t, either.</p><p>&#x201c;Calf&#x2019;s backward, Mom,&#x201d; Ray reported. &#x201c;Its legs are all tangled up, too.&#x201d;</p><p>Jeanette pressed two fingers to her forehead, closed her eyes, then shot me a look like it was all my fault, which I guess it was, me and that damned bull. &#x201c;All right, looks like we got to do this thing. Mike, you set me up. Ray, you shave. I&#x2019;ll do the epidural.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray got to work with the electric razor, and I set out the hemostats, scalpels, needles, and sutures our surgeon would need. When Ray was finished, I applied antiseptic over the shaved area. By then, Jeanette was done with the epidural and the little mama&#x2019;s legs were quivering. I released the catch and Ray and I did our best to let the cow down easy. &#x201c;You hold her, Ray,&#x201d; Jeanette ordered. &#x201c;Mike, you get over here and help me.&#x201d;</p><p>I took up station beside Jeanette. When she glanced at me, I gave her a reassuring smile, which earned me a full-bore, Jeanette Coulter frown. She turned back to the heifer and cut decisively. &#x201c;Lidocaine,&#x201d; she ordered and I squirted it in, numbing the separated tissue. She cut deeper, a spray of blood erupting from the wound. I patted the droplets off her face with a damp cloth while she applied a hemostat to the bleeder. When she took up the scalpel again, she cut delicately into the muslin-thin wall of the uterus with her reward being a pair of black hooves that pushed through the opening. &#x201c;Get it, boys,&#x201d; she ordered and Ray and I immediately complied, lifting out the slippery calf and swinging it clear. It had to weigh at least a hundred pounds, a lot of calf for such a small cow.</p><p>&#x201c;Looks to be a heifer,&#x201d; Ray reported.</p><p>&#x201c;Wipe the mucous off its face before it suffocates,&#x201d; Jeanette ordered. &#x201c;Then get some burlap and clean her up. Mike, you get back over here and let&#x2019;s get this little mama sewed back together.&#x201d;</p><p>While she sutured, I sprayed antiseptic. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t drown her, for gosh sake,&#x201d; she scolded after I got a little too enthusiastic.</p><p>The uterus stitched, Jeanette took up a bigger needle with a thicker gut and began to lace up the hide. When she was half-finished, she said, &#x201c;Ray, why don&#x2019;t you put in a few sutures? Try to do it like you saw me. Not deep, just catch the hide.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray eagerly came over and took up the needle. Jeanette inspected his work and said, &#x201c;Not bad,&#x201d; which was high praise from her. She took the needle back, finished sewing, tied the thread off, and announced the end of the operation, saying, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see if she&#x2019;ll get up. Mike, go give her a nudge.&#x201d;</p><p>Imagine a doc expecting a human female to stand up after a C-section! But Jeanette knew if the cow didn&#x2019;t get up, it would die. I knelt beside the fresh new mama and nudged her but she didn&#x2019;t take the hint. For a minute or so, she just laid there, looking dazed, but then something clicked in her brain and she suddenly got up on her own, staggered a little, her eyes wide and glittery. She looked at me, then at Ray, then at Jeanette, and then started bawling. &#x201c;She wants her calf,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Jeanette was stripping off her gloves. &#x201c;Then let her have it. Put them in one of the stalls. We&#x2019;ll let them have a night in the barn. And make sure there&#x2019;s plenty of water. She&#x2019;s gonna be thirsty. Come on you guys. Stop grinning and get moving. I got to clean up in here.&#x201d;</p><p>I checked my watch. It had been a little over two hours since I had yelled up at Jeanette as she stood in the window. Nude. That was a hard image to get out of my head. Anyway, she was both a fast and good surgeon. She was also a damn fine boss. I was in love with her, of course, but I wasn&#x2019;t about to let her know that. Too many complications and, anyway, I knew she was never going to get over old Bill even though his ashes had been scattered across the ranch five years ago. Heart attack. At the funeral, a cowboy who&#x2019;d once worked on the Square C confided to me he was surprised Bill had a heart. Well, he had one and still did. Jeanette&#x2019;s.</p><p>Ray and I shepherded mother and child into the barn, picked an empty stall, got them in it, and it didn&#x2019;t take two seconds before the calf was suckling the heifer&#x2019;s teats, a very good sign. I tagged the calf&#x2019;s ear and Ray gave it its shots. When Jeanette came into the barn, we were putting everything up. She said, &#x201c;Ray, you get back to bed. Did you finish your homework?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes ma&#x2019;am, but it&#x2019;s gonna be hard getting to school with all this rain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see about that. Mike, I guess I&#x2019;m done with you.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray pulled on his coat and went out. I went back into the surgery and got my slicker. I knew Jeanette wasn&#x2019;t going anywhere. She would spend the night with the heifer and the newborn, just to make sure they were OK. &#x201c;Well, good night, what&#x2019;s left of it,&#x201d; I said as I passed her.</p><p>&#x201c;You were supposed to check that heifer every two hours,&#x201d; she said to my back.</p><p>I stopped but I didn&#x2019;t turn around. &#x201c;Yeah. Guess I got distracted working on your tractor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cows come first on the Square C, Mike.&#x201d;</p><p>Jeanette had me dead to rights and there was nothing I could say so I just nodded and went on outside. The rain had stopped, but there were still distant pulses of lightning, enough to light up my way as I carefully slogged through the mud to my trailer. I kicked off my galoshes at the door, shucked off the slicker and wet clothes, and crawled beneath the blankets on my narrow bunk. There was no sign of the cats. A few hours later, when I woke, it was just starting to get bright outside and a glance out my window told me the storm was done. I could even make out some stars. Montana weather can do that, turn on a dime and leave you nine cents change.</p><p>We&#x2019;d saved the heifer and her calf, I had seen Jeanette naked from the waist up, Ray had gotten to see a C-section, and Montana had scared us all half to death but hadn&#x2019;t managed to kill us. I was content but that was because I didn&#x2019;t know a young man was on his way to us, bringing with him a knowledge of the astonishing creatures that had once walked our land and an ancient and present reality I knew all too well called murder.</p><p>THE DINOSAUR HUNTER Copyright � 2010 by Solomon Jones</p></p><h2>Seeking Spiritual Direction: How to Grow the Divine Life Within</h2><p>Father Thomas Dubay has written a guide for Christians who are considering spiritual direction or who are already engaged in the process.

The protagonist of the series, Alvin, is a <i>maker</i> who not only can fix things (such as restoring a wounded bird to health with his doodlebug) but is also something of a natural leader. Alvin and his small band of followers are on a quest to build the Crystal City, a place where those who have knacks can live in safety from the people who sometimes burn them as witches. While Alvin visits the nearly holy province of New England to find out just how cities work, his wife Margaret, traveling under the name Peggy, journeys to the kingdom of Camelot, which was formerly known as Charleston, South Carolina. There she hopes to persuade the exiled King Arthur to help her abolish the practice of slavery. Heartfire is an excellent midseries novel that's sure to delight fans of Alvin. <i>--Craig E.

Just before dawn, on peaceable Willobee Street, Ma and Pa Brindle open a dusty attic trunk to find the recipe for Sweet Dream Pie. Ma skeptically arches a white eyebrow, but Pa promises, "I'll be good this time." His antic expression, however, is an early clue that he'll do nothing of the sort. The tension builds as Ma and Pa throw ingredients into a pie tin the size of a hot tub. The recipe alone could cause cavities: "Gumdrops flew through the air and rained down with marshmallows, candy corn, cinnamon hots.... A chocolate tornado sprang up and whirled out the door." That afternoon, as the pie bubbles, an ominous heat wave settles on the neighborhood, and everyone longs to taste Ma's pie. After sundown, Pa and a boy stagger outside with the magical treat, and Ma ceremonially rings a bell that starts the feeding frenzy. All warnings for moderation are ignored, and Ma spends the night shooing away the green, semitransparent monsters of not-so-Sweet Dreams. Teague invents an entire town of awestruck humans, cats and dogs. His quasi-caricaturish style is aptly matched to the over-the-top story, and while his nightmare lizards and dinosaurs look weird and appropriately incongruous on sedate Willobee Street, their goony grins and monsters-just-want-to-have-fun playfulness will keep readers from getting scared. Wood may not discourage sugar junkies from eating sweets at bedtime, but she and Teague whip up a truly spine-tingling tall tale.

Archaeology And Folk Religion In Ancient Israel</h2><p><p>In this masterful commentary, respected biblical scholar Bruce Waltke carefully interprets the message of the prophet Micah, building a bridge between Micah's ancient world and our life today.</p><p>Waltke's Commentary on Micah quickly distinguishes itself from other commentaries on this book by displaying an unprecedented exegetical thoroughness, an expert understanding of historical context, and a keen interest in illuminating the contribution of Micah to Christian theology. Tackling hard questions about date and authorship, Waltke contends that Micah himself wrote and edited the nineteen sermons comprising the book. Waltke's clear analytical outline leads readers through the three cycles of Micah, each beginning with an oracle of doom and ending with an oracle of hope, decisively showing that hope wins over doom.</p><p>Learned yet amazingly accessible, combining scholarly erudition with passion for Micah's contemporary relevance, this book will well serve teachers, pastors, and students alike.</p></p><p>William G.

It is the "inward man", it is the re&#x2013;created spirit; it is the part of man with which God deals. It is really an unveiling of what we are in Christ today; of what He says we are; what He has made us to be in His great Redemptive work. The Pauline Epistles must ever stand as the work of a super&#x2013;genius or a divine revelation. It lets us into the inner secret of God's mighty purpose in the Incarnation. The four Gospels give us the earth walk of the Master, but the Pauline Epistles give us a revelation of what happened on the cross, what followed during the three days and three nights until Christ was raised from the dead. We get the living picture of the entire substitutionary work of Christ. It is the legal background of our Redemption. This challenging book should be studied by every earnest student of the Word.</p><p>Dr. E. W. Kenyon (1867&#x2014;1948) was born in Saratoga County, New York.

As a technician for the Apricity Corporation, with its patented happiness machine, she provides customers with personalized recommendations for greater contentment. She's good at her job, her office manager tells her, successful. But how does one measure an emotion? <br><br>Meanwhile, there's Pearl's teenage son, Rhett. A sensitive kid who has forged an unconventional path through adolescence, Rhett seems to find greater satisfaction in being <i>unhappy</i>. The very rejection of joy is his own kind of "pursuit of happiness." As his mother, Pearl wants nothing more than to help Rhett--but is it for his sake or for hers? Certainly it would make Pearl happier. Regardless, her son is one person whose emotional life does not fall under the parameters of her job--not as happiness technician, and not as mother, either. <br><br>Told from an alternating cast of endearing characters from within Pearl and Rhett's world, <i>Tell the Machine Goodnight</i> delivers a smartly moving and entertaining story about the advance of technology and the ways that it can most surprise and define us. Along the way, Katie Williams playfully illuminates our national obsession with positive psychology, our reliance on quick fixes. What happens when these obsessions begin to overlap? With warmth, humor, and a clever touch, Williams taps into our collective unease about the modern world and allows us see it a little more clearly.</p><p>Katie Williams's short fiction has appeared in <i>The Atlantic, American Short Fiction, Prairie Schooner, Subtropics</i>, and elsewhere.

This is her first novel for adults.1<br><br> The Happiness Machine<br><br> Apricity (archaic): the feeling of sun on one's skin in the winter<br><br> The machine said the man should eat tangerines. It listed two other recommendations as well, so three in total. A modest number, Pearl assured the man as she read out the list that had appeared on the screen before her: one, he should eat tangerines on a regular basis; two, he should work at a desk that received morning light; three, he should amputate the uppermost section of his right index finger.<br><br> The man-in his early thirties, by Pearl's guess, and pinkish around the eyes and nose in the way of white rabbits or rats-lifted his right hand before his face with wonder. Up came his left, too, and he used its palm to press experimentally on the top of his right index finger, the finger in question. Is he going to cry? Pearl wondered. Sometimes people cried when they heard their recommendations. The conference room they'd put her in had glass walls, open to the workpods on the other side. There was a switch on the wall to fog the glass, though; Pearl could flick it if the man started to cry.<br><br> "I know that last one seems a bit out of left field," she said.<br><br> "Right field, you mean," the man-Pearl glanced at her list for his name, one Melvin Waxler-joked, his lips drawing up to reveal overlong front teeth. Rabbitier still. "Get it?" He waved his hand. "Right hand. Right field."<br><br> Pearl smiled obligingly, but Mr. Waxler had eyes only for his finger. He pressed its tip once more.<br><br> "A modest recommendation," Pearl said, "compared to some others I've seen."<br><br> "Oh sure, I know that," Waxler said. "My downstairs neighbor sat for your machine once. It told him to cease all contact with his brother." He pressed on the finger again. "He and his brother didn't argue or anything. Had a good relationship actually, or so my neighbor said. Supportive. Brotherly." Pressed it. "But he did it. Cut the guy off. Stopped talking to him, full stop." Pressed it. "And it worked. He says he's happier now. Says he didn't have a clue his brother was making him unhappy. His twin brother. Identical even. If I'm remembering." Clenched the hand into a fist. "But it turned out he was. Unhappy, that is. And the machine knew it, too."<br><br> "The recommendations can seem strange at first," Pearl began her spiel, memorized from the manual, "but we must keep in mind the Apricity machine uses a sophisticated metric, taking into account factors of which we're not consciously aware. The proof is borne out in the numbers. The Apricity system boasts a nearly one hundred percent approval rating. Ninety-nine point nine seven percent."<br><br> "And the point three percent?" The index finger popped up from Waxler's fist. It just wouldn't stay down.<br><br> "Aberrations."<br><br> Pearl allowed herself a glance at Mr. Waxler's fingertip, which appeared no different from the others on his hand but was its own aberration, according to Apricity. She imagined the fingertip popping off his hand like a cork from a bottle. When Pearl looked up again, she found that Waxler's gaze had shifted from his finger to her face. The two of them shared the small smile of strangers.<br><br> "You know what?" Waxler bent and straightened his finger. "I've never liked it much. This particular finger. It got slammed in a door when I was little, and ever since . . ." His lip drew up, revealing his teeth again, almost a wince.<br><br> "It pains you?"<br><br> "It doesn't hurt. It just feels . . . like it doesn't belong."<br><br> Pearl tapped a few commands into her screen and read what came back. "The surgical procedure carries minimal risk of infection and zero risk of mortality. Recovery time is negligible, a week, no more. And with a copy of your Apricity report-there, I've just sent that to you, HR, and your listed physician-your employer has agreed to cover all relevant costs."<br><br> Waxler's lip slid back down. "Hm. No reason not to then."<br><br> "No. No reason."<br><br> He thought a moment more. Pearl waited, careful to keep her expression neutral until he nodded the go-ahead. When he did, she tapped in the last command and, with a small burst of satisfaction, crossed his name off her list. Melvin Waxler. Done.<br><br> "I've also recommended that your workpod be reassigned to the eastern side of the building," she said, "near a window."<br><br> "Thank you. That'll be nice."<br><br> Pearl finished with the last prompt question, the one that would close the session and inch her closer to her quarterly bonus. "Mr. Waxler, would you say that you anticipate Apricity's recommendations will improve your overall life satisfaction?" This phrasing was from the updated training manual. The question used to be Will Apricity make you happier? but Legal had decided that the word happier was problematic.<br><br> "Seems like it could," Waxler said. "The finger thing might lower my typing speed." He shrugged. "But then there's more to life than typing speed."<br><br> "So . . . yes?"<br><br> "Sure. I mean, yes."<br><br> "Wonderful. Thank you for your time today."<br><br> Mr. Waxler rose to go, but then, as if struck by an impulse, he stopped and reached out for the Apricity 480, which sat on the table between them. Pearl had just last week been outfitted with the new model; sleeker than the Apricity 470 and smaller, too, the size of a deck of cards, the machine had fluted edges and a light gray casing that reflected a subtle sheen, like the smoke inside a fortune-teller's ball. Waxler's hand hovered over it.<br><br> "May I?" he said.<br><br> At Pearl's nod, he tapped the edge of the Apricity with the tip of the finger now scheduled to be amputated in-confirmations from both HR and the doctor's office had already arrived on Pearl's screen-a little over two weeks. Was it Pearl's imagination or did Mr. Waxler already stand a bit taller, as if an invisible yoke had been lifted from his shoulders? Was the pink around his eyes and nose now matched by a healthy flush to the cheek?<br><br> Waxler paused in the doorway. "Can I ask one more thing?"<br><br> "Certainly."<br><br> "Does it have to be tangerines, or will any citrus do?"<br><br> pearl had worked as a contentment technician for the Apricity Corporation�s San Francisco office since 2026. Nine years. While her colleagues hopped to new job titles or start-ups, Pearl stayed on. Pearl liked staying on. This was how she�d lived her life. After graduating college, Pearl had stayed on at the first place that had hired her, working as a nocturnal executive assistant for brokers trading in the Asian markets. After having her son, she�d stayed on at home until he�d started school. After getting married to her college boyfriend, she�d stayed on as his wife, until Elliot had an affair and left her. Pearl was fine where she was, that�s all. She liked her work, sitting with customers who had purchased one of Apricity�s three-tiered Contentment Assessment Packages, collecting their samples, and talking them through the results.<br><br> Her current assignment was a typical one. The customer, the up-and-coming San Francisco marketing firm !Huzzah!, had purchased Apricity's Platinum Package in the wake of an employee death, or, as Pearl's boss had put it, "A very un-merry Christmas and to one a goodnight!" Hours after the holiday party, a !Huzzah! copywriter had committed suicide in the office lounge. The night cleaning service had found the poor woman, but hours too late. Word of the death had made the rounds, of course, both its cause and its location. !Huzzah!'s January reports noted a decrease in worker productivity, an accompanying increase in complaints to HR. February's reports were grimmer still, the first weeks of March abysmal.<br><br> So !Huzzah! turned to the Apricity Corporation and, through them, Pearl, who'd been brought into !Huzzah!'s office in SoMa to create a contentment plan for each of the firm's fifty-four employees. Happiness is Apricity. That was the slogan. Pearl wondered what the dead copywriter would think of it.<br><br> The Apricity assessment process itself was noninvasive. The only item that the machine needed to form its recommendations was a swab of skin cells from the inside of the cheek. This was Pearl's first task on a job, to hand out and collect back a cotton swab, swipe a hint of captured saliva across a computer chip, and then fit the loaded chip into a slot in the machine. The Apricity 480 took it from there, spelling out a personalized contentment plan in mere minutes. Pearl had always marveled at this: to think that the solution to one's happiness lay next to the residue of the bagel one had eaten for breakfast!<br><br> But it was true. Pearl had sat for Apricity herself and felt its effects. Though for most of Pearl's life unhappiness had only ever been a mild emotion, not a cloud overhead, as she'd heard others describe it, surely nothing like the fog of a depressive, none of this bad weather. Pearl's unhappiness was more like the wisp of smoke from a snuffed candle. A birthday candle at that. Steady, stalwart, even-keeled: these were the words that had been applied to her since childhood. And she supposed she looked the part: dark hair cropped around her ears and neck in a tidy swimmer's cap; features pleasing but not too pretty; figure trim up top and round in the thighs and bottom, like one of those inflatable dolls that will rock back up after you punch it down. In fact, Pearl had been selected for her job as an Apricity technician because she possessed, as her boss had put it, "an aura of wooly contentment, like you have a blanket draped over your head."<br><br> "You rarely worry. You never despair," he'd gone on, while Pearl sat before him and tugged at the cuffs of the suit jacket she'd bought for the interview. "Your tears are drawn from the puddle, not the ocean. Are you happy right now? You are, aren't you?"<br><br> "I'm fine."<br><br> "You're fine! Yes!" he shouted at this revelation. "You store your happiness in a warehouse, not a coin pouch. It can be bought cheap!"<br><br> "Thank you?"<br><br> "You're very welcome. Look. This little guy likes you"-he'd indicated the Apricity 320 in prime position on his desk-"and that means I like you, too."<br><br> That interview had been nine years and sixteen Apricity models ago. Since then Pearl had suffered dozens more of her boss's vaguely insulting metaphors and had, more importantly, seen the Apricity system prove itself hundreds-no, thousands of times. While other tech companies shriveled into obsolescence or swelled into capitalistic behemoths, the Apricity Corporation, guided by its CEO and founder, Bradley Skrull, had stayed true to its mission. Happiness is Apricity. Yes, Pearl was a believer.<br><br> However, she was not so na�ve as to expect that everyone else must share her belief. While Pearl's next appointment of the day went nearly as smoothly as Mr. Waxler's-the man barely blinked at the recommendation that he divorce his wife and hire a series of reputable sex workers to fulfill his carnal needs-the appointment after that went unexpectedly poorly. The subject was a middle-aged web designer, and though Apricity's recommendation seemed a minor one, to adopt a religious practice, and though Pearl pointed out that this could be interpreted as anything from Catholicism to Wicca, the woman stormed out of the room, shouting that Pearl wanted her to become weak minded, and that this would suit her employer's purposes quite well, wouldn't it, now? Pearl sent a request to HR to schedule a follow-up appointment for the next day. Usually these situations righted themselves after the subject had had time to contemplate. Sometimes Apricity confronted people with their secret selves, and, as Pearl had tried to explain to the shouting woman, such a passionate reaction, even if negative, was surely a sign of just this.<br><br> Still, Pearl arrived home deflated-the metaphorical blanket over her head feeling a bit threadbare-to find her apartment empty. Surprisingly, stunningly empty. She made a circuit of the rooms twice before acknowledging that Rhett had, for the first time since he'd come back from the clinic, left the house of his own volition. A shiver ran through her and gathered, buzzing, beneath each of her fingernails. She fumbled with her screen, pulling it from the depths of her pocket and unfolding it.<br><br> "Just got home," she spoke into it.<br><br> k, came the eventual reply.<br><br> "You're not here," she said. What she wanted to say: Where the hell are you?<br><br> fnshd hw wnt out came back.<br><br> "Be home in time for dinner."<br><br> The alert that her message had been sent and received sounded like her screen had heaved a deep mechanical sigh.<br><br> Her apartment was in the outer avenues of the city's Richmond District. You could walk to the ocean, could see a corner of it even, gray and tumbling, if you pressed your cheek against the bathroom window and peered left. Pearl pictured Rhett alone on the beach, walking into the surf. But no, she shouldn't think that way. Rhett's absence from the apartment was a good thing. It was possible-wasn't it?-that he'd gone out with friends from his old school. Maybe one of them had thought of him and decided to call him up. Maybe Josiah, who'd seemed the best of the bunch. He'd been the last of them to stop visiting, had written Rhett at the clinic, had once pointed to one of the dark bruises that had patterned Rhett's limbs and said, Ouch, so sadly and sweetly it was as if the bruise were on his own arm, the blood pooling under the surface of his own unmarked skin.<br><br> Pearl said it now, out loud, in her empty apartment.<br><br> "Ouch."<br><br> Speaking the word brought no pain.<br><br> To pass the hour until dinner, Pearl got out her latest modeling kit. The kits had been on Apricity's contentment plan for Pearl. She was nearly done with her latest, a trilobite from the Devonian period. She fitted together the last plates of the skeleton, using a tiny screwdriver to turn the tinier screws hidden beneath each synthetic bone. This completed, she brushed a pebbled leathery material with a thin coat of glue and fitted the fabric snugly over the exoskeleton. She paused and assessed. Yes. The trilobite was shaping up nicely.<br><br> When it came to her models, Pearl didn't skimp or rush. She ordered high-end kits, the hard parts produced with exactitude by a 3-D printer, the soft parts grown in a brew of artfully spliced DNA. Once again, Apricity had been correct in its assessment. Pearl felt near enough to happiness in that moment when she sliced open the cellophane of a new kit and inhaled the sharp smell of its artifice.</p><h2>The Adversary (Saga of Pliocene Exile, No 4)</h2><p>They took a one-way trip into the unknown, but can they find a way back?</p><p>The fourth and final volume of The Saga of Pliocene Exile.<br>Until the arrival of Aiken Drum, the 100,000 humans who had fled backward in time to Pliocene exile on Earth knew little but slavery to the Tanu -- the humanoid aliens who came from another galaxy.

The first novel to tell the story of the Americans who were driven out in 1958, this is a masterful debut. <br> <br> Young Everly Lederer and K. C. Stites come of age in Oriente Province, where the Americans tend their own fiefdom -- three hundred thousand acres of United Fruit Company sugarcane that surround their gated enclave. If the rural tropics are a child's dreamworld, Everly and K.C. nevertheless have keen eyes for the indulgences and betrayals of the grown-ups around them -- the mordant drinking and illicit loves, the race hierarchies and violence. <br> <br> In Havana, a thousand kilometers and a world away from the American colony, a cabaret dancer meets a French agitator named Christian de La Mazi�re, whose seductive demeanor can't mask his shameful past. Together they become enmeshed in the brewing political underground. When Fidel and Ra�l Castro lead a revolt from the mountains above the cane plantation, torching the sugar and kidnapping a boat full of "yanqui" revelers, K.C. and Everly begin to discover the brutality that keeps the colony humming. Though their parents remain blissfully untouched by the forces of history, the children hear the whispers of what is to come. <br> <br> At the time, urgent news was conveyed by telex. Kushner's first novel is a tour de force, haunting and compelling, with the urgency of a telex from a forgotten time and place.</p><p>Rachel Kushner's first novel, <i>Telex from Cuba</i>, doesn't read like your usual debut. Using family stories, extensive archival research, and all the tools of the novelist's imagination, she creates a portrait in many voices of a small society at a crucial moment in time: the American sugar cane and nickel-mining colony in the last years before Castro and the first moments of his revolution. As seen through the lives of the children and wives of American executives, and the parallel intrigues of a nightclub dancer with powerful friends and a former French collaborator--along with striking cameos by historical figures like the Castro brothers, Hemingway, and, yes, Colonel Sanders--Kushner's Cuba makes the raw materials of revolution, and its aftermath, come alive. <p></p> <p> <strong>Questions for Rachel Kushner</strong> </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You're writing about the end of one era for Cuba at what may be the end of another. Was that in your mind as you wrote? </p><p> <strong>Kushner:</strong> It wasn't so much, actually, but that might be because I wrote the bulk of the book before Fidel fell ill with diverticulitis, and before the American media's obsession with his (like all of ours) eventual death hit a pitch point. Even now, I find this sense of waiting and the media's focus on it to be an odd tautology: the "breaking" story is often that there's a breaking story, but then the story never comes. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Fidel Castro's policies, his segue out of public view has been pretty brilliant. He trumped the media's deathwatch by stepping down, which took away the promise in his death: nothing substantial has changed to date, except the perception that his move away from the role of <i>lider</i> would precipitate change. I do hear he has more time to read now. Someone apparently gave him a copy of <i>Telex from Cuba</i>. I'd like to think he's reading it now, in that tracksuit that replaced the military fatigues. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> The kernel of your story was your mother's childhood, similar to some of those you describe in the book, growing up in Cuba as the daughter of an American mining executive. Did you hear her stories about that time during your own childhood? What did you add to them when you started doing your own research? </p><p> <strong>Kushner:</strong> I indeed heard lots of stories when I was a kid--Cuba has a real mythological importance to my mother and her sisters and how they think of themselves (my mother, for instance, was under the sway of their Jamaican houseboy, Cleveland, who is the inspiration for Willy in my book). My grandparents, dead for many years now, saved an incredible trove of stuff from their life in Cuba: every last receipt from the United Fruit commissary where my grandmother bought groceries, a mimeograph of every letter she sent, etc. I spent about three years going through this stuff, and interviewing my mother and her sisters and others they&#x2019;d grown up with. But then I had to disconnect completely from all that, and build a fictional structure and then adhere precisely to its logic and requirements, which meant only using what served my story. Just because something is true does not mean it has a place. Often it turned out quite the opposite, that the people and characters and details I imagined were much more fluid and true seeming, and it was the "true life" detail that stuck out and seemed awkward. </p><p> That said, by so thoroughly metabolizing the "real" American colony, I was able to depict mine freehand, if you will, in a way that is (hopefully) convincing, that works as fiction but is a realm you can enter and see an erased world. I know that those who grew up in Nicaro have read the book and loved it, so that's nice. And there are many keys and arrows that point to or hint at real people and events, if amalgamations. Some of the American employees, for instance, were kidnapped and later invited to Raul's wedding. There was a Cuban investor who was a kind of interloper and got Batista's air force to strafe Nicaro, in order to drive the Americans out. I spoke on the phone to the former mine manager's wife, who told me that this Cuban investor threatened to kill her husband if he stayed. So that&#x2019;s a real-life detail. I guess there are many, but they are a bare-bones architecture; how fiction becomes fiction is less linear, more mysterious, and might I say difficult! </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> This isn't your usual fiction debut, channeled through the perspective of a single navel. You take on a whole society's worth of voices, often in one scene (I'm thinking in particular of the wonderful party scene at the center of the book). Was that your intention from the beginning, or did you start with one perspective and then find yourself needing more? </p><p><strong>Kushner:</strong> It's true, not one navel, and not my own, either. Probably that's partly why it took me so long to write it. I somehow always knew it would be a structure of multiple voices, rather than a single protagonist. I had become attached, from early on, to the idea--whether I have achieved it or not--of getting at the complex and varied forces of revolution and what led to it, i.e, how did the Americans participate, how did it constitute them, and the reverse, how did they affect it? There would have been no way to do this without rendering the story from multiple perspectives. Alejo Carpentier does it for the Haitian Revolution in <i>The Kingdom of This World</i>, for instance, with one narrator named Ti No�l, but he has this guy live about 200 years, so he can witness every significant juncture in the epic. </p><p> My problem was not a protracted timeframe, but a subtle network of dynamics: the American executives at United Fruit and the Nicaro Nickel Company were dealing with Batista and in denial of the revolution. But the revolution was obviously real, and so I needed to send some people up into the mountains to behold what was happening there. A disaffected narrator like La Mazi�re--like Rachel K, based on a real life figure of that same name--serves this role. Also, he cuts through a bit of the romance associated with revolutionary change. He's totally jaded and there for all the "wrong" reasons, an adventurer who sees violence as mystical, as a "pure" agent of change, if you will. And Rachel K was useful in that she could reveal some of what was happening in Havana and be close to the big political players in the government as well as the underground. </p><p> Lastly, a child who can see it all up close, like Everly, can reveal certain less mediated truths, without the more narrow judgments and strictures of adult thinking. Everly can hold contradiction in her mind and not be forced to resolve it, which is what maturity so often does to the process of thinking. On the other hand, in K.C. I wanted a child narrator who was looking back in hindsight, who has some degree of awareness, but not complete awareness, of how and whether his memories hold up over time: is the world he loves as benevolent as it had seemed to him as a child? Was it benevolent even then? Regardless, it's his <i>childhood</i> as well as a place, and he has a right to have his own feelings about his own childhood, even if the implications of it are so much larger than one boy's life. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You leave yourself almost entirely out of the story, but there is one provocatively named character who apparently shares very little of your own biography: Rachel K. How did she come into the story, and how did she come to share your name? </p><p> <strong>Kushner:</strong> Actually, Rachel K is a real-life historic figure of pre-Castro Cuba, though specifically of the dictator Machado's era, and not Batista's. While I was researching the book, I came across a reference to her while reading Michael Chanan's comprehensive book about post-revolutionary films, <i>The Cuban Image</i>. Rachel K (no period after K&#x2014;in every Cuban history reference, she is, as if sprung from a Kafkan universe, referred to this way) was a "French variety dancer" who became an icon after she was found mysteriously murdered in a hotel room. No one ever figured out what happened, and the mystery of her death came to signify the mortal decadence of Havana in the 1930s. The Cubans made a film about her in 1973 called <i>The Strange Case of Rachel K</i>. Because of her role in history, and in historical imagery, and due to the striking coincidence that her name is like mine, I felt it would be an act of exclusion <i>not</i> to put her in the book. I took the "cue" and ran with it, basically. And as you say, yeah, she is unlike me, which makes her perhaps a perverse or fun surrogate: she's discreet and dispassionate, qualities I wish I possessed, but in fact do not. Though perhaps she is my repressed double, "more me than me." On the surface I am much more like Everly: a goofy fabulist. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You've visited Cuba a lot in recent years. What memories are there of the pre-Castro times and of the American presence? </p><p> <strong>Kushner:</strong> The residue is everywhere. There's the layer of it that many people know--the American cars, the rusted and burned-out neon signs for Woolworth's and Zenith Televisions et cetera in bigger cities like Havana and Santiago. In the Nipe Bay region, the northeastern part of what used to be called Oriente Province (now divided up) where my book takes place, suddenly, the residue is both less visible, and yet much, much stronger: the real story is there, lurking, and going there and excavating that residue was crucial to writing the book. </p><p> In Nicaro, for instance, it's a small mining town and there is no skeleton of midcentury American retail, and without an architectural heritage like you have in the cities, there was little to stop the Soviet-financed construction of huge Brutalist apartment buildings. So you don't think, shiny 1950s America when you get there. But everyone you speak to who is old enough knows they live in a former American colony, and when we went, all the Jamaicans and Haitians who had worked as butlers in the houses of my grandparents and their friends are still there, and they told me stories about the town in its colonial, er, heyday. The managers row, which features in my book, is still there, and the biggest house, which the mine administrator lived in, is now a school. Fidel had a real axe to grind with Nicaro--not unfounded, by any means--and I'm sure the children are aware that the facility's benefactor is a banished "yanqui" landlord. </p><p> Preston, the United Fruit Company town, has been renamed, but it was an American town in every way. United Fruit built the entire infrastructure, the roads, the electricity, ran their own mail service, the trains, shipping, everything. The town they built is still there, and the houses, once uniformly "company property" even in paint scheme (all over Central and South America United Fruit painted their towns a particular shade of mustard yellow) have never been repainted. And so what paint is still there is a palimpsest of the Old Order: faded patches of mustard yellow linger on the weathered exterior of every house. The old company hotel where my mother used to sit on the porch and sip her cane juice, waiting for my grandmother to shop, is still there, but it has no windows and the tile floors are cracked. United Fruit departed very quickly when Fidel nationalized the mills, and they left a huge cache of company records, which I discovered behind a chainlink fence in the back of the public library in Banes. The Cubans know it's part of their history, which is why it's in the library, but like every other detail of American life, its state of decay, moldering under a leaky roof, is part of the allure: a history erased, but not completely... </p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> My strongest sense of that moment (until I read your book) was from one of my favorite movies, the glorious documentary, <i>I Am Cuba</i>. Did that play a role in helping you imagine the times? <p> <strong>Kushner:</strong> Funny you should ask, because one of the images on my website, www.telexfromcuba.com, is a still I made from <i>I Am Cuba</i>, of women in a poolside beauty contest, to depict what La Mazi�re means when he speaks of a place "where dreams are marbled with nothingness"--i.e., a place simultaneously at a height and in decline, upon which he's projecting his own knowledge of decline, having lived through the German occupation of Paris and their subsequent departure eastward, as they were crushed by the Allies and the party was over. I thought a lot about whether or not to use this image, because the film was not made in the fifties, but in 1964, and moreover with a real political agenda. That said, it is indeed an amazing film, and the tracking shot into the swimming pool at the beginning is right up there with the tracking shot at the beginning of <i>Touch of Evil</i> as a stunning technical feat (and was even replicated by Paul Thomas Anderson in the opening of <i>Boogie Nights</i>). But <i>I Am Cuba</i> is more than just beautiful and strange. It is, as I said, extremely dogmatic, it's a piece of propaganda, really, and yet it is one of only a handful of films that you show you what prerevolutionary Havana might have looked like. There are no films made in the fifties that actually portray life in Havana at that time, at least that I am aware of. It's the closest thing, despite its dogma.

In his fourteen seasons as a head coach, he is 832-316, the best winning record in NBA history. He also holds NBA coaching records for most playoff wins and playoff winning percentage. Prior to coaching, he played thirteen years in the NBA, primarily with the New York Knicks. He is also the author of <i>Maverick</i>, <i>Sacred Hoops</i>, and, with his friend Charley Rosen, <i>More Than a Game</i>.Basketball fans, especially those with a predilection for Zen Buddhism, will find this account of the Los Angeles Lakers' 2003-04 season, the author's last as head coach, fascinating reading. Here all is laid bare: the egos, tirades, childish behavior, and sacrifice characteristic of play at the highest professional level. Narrator Stephen Hoye is an inspired, and inspiring, choice for this book. At his best, it's difficult to separate his voice from Jackson's, so completely does he reflect the author's persona and inflections. At his worst, he magnifies Jackson's condescension and dogmatic nature, which pervades the book. Overall, though, Hoye is interesting, appropriately dramatic, and easy on the ears.

From the largest whale to the smallest shrew, here is a wealth of information and a source of pleasure for any nature lover.After receiving a fine arts degree from the University of California at Berkeley and completing two years of graduate work in design at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, <b>Ruth Heller</b> (1923-2004) began her career designing wrapping paper, cocktail napkins, greeting cards, and coloring books. After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br> <br> She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br> <br> Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."</p><h2>Worship: The Christians Highest Occupation/#8-98</h2><p>If the title of this book is correct, as we believe it is, then the importance of the subject will be obvious to every child of God. A great deal of confusion exists in Christendom as to just what constitutes worship. It is often confounded with listening to a sermon; with service for the Lord on behalf of others; with testimony to Christ&#39;s saving and satisfying grace; with the preaching of the gospel; with ministry of the Word to believers, and with prayer. Many Christians put the emphasis of their lives on service for God, to the exclusion of the worship of God. Others swing to the other extreme, and so stress the importance of worship, that service for the Lord is viewed as being of little or no consequence. We must beware of lopsidedness, or of seeking to push one truth of Scripture to an extreme the Bible does not warrant. The believer must seek to maintain the truth of God in its proper perspective and correct balance. The words of our Lord Jesus Christ give the proper order of precedence. In His reply to Satan&#39;s temptation, He said: &#34;Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve.&#34; (Matt. 4:10) That quality of worship which does not result in service and that service which does not flow from worship, both come short of the Divine ideal. We shall consider the subject of worship under the following ten headings: 1. Its meaning, or definition 2. Its importance 3. Its authority 4. Its object 5. Its ground 6. Its power 7. Its manner 8. Its hindrances 9. Its place 10. Its results --------------- Alfred P. Gibbs (1890-1967) was a man born to preach. Brought up with his twin brother Edwin in South Africa, both boys early came to know, love, and serve the Lord Jesus Christ. Edwin (1890-1968) stayed on in South Africa to pursue a fruitful evangelistic and Bible teaching work.</p><p></p><h2>Morningside Heights: A Novel</h2><p>Following the tremendous success of her first book, a nonfiction work on housekeeping that became a surprise bestseller, Cheryl Mendelson brings to her debut novel the same intensely readable style that made <b>Home Comforts </b>so popular.

The Braithwaites, musicians with several young children, are at the core of a circle of friends who make their living as writers, psychiatrists, and professors. But as the novel opens, their comfortable life is being threatened as a buoyant economy sends newly rich Wall Street types scurrying northward in search of good investments and more space. At the same time, the Braithwaites weather the difficult love lives of their friends, and all of the characters confront their fears that the institutions and social values that have until now provided them with meaning and stability&#x2014;science, religion, the arts&#x2014;are in increasing decline.

Perhaps it&#x2019;s the rugged terrain, beautiful scenery, or vast natural landscape that appeals to you. Or maybe you&#x2019;re just a lunatic who wants to survive in a lifeless barren wasteland. Whatever your reasons, there are a few things you should know:</p> <p><b>1: You&#x2019;re going to need a pressure vessel.</b></p> <p>Mars&#x2019;s atmospheric pressure is less than one percent of Earth&#x2019;s. So basically, it&#x2019;s nothing. Being on the surface of Mars is almost the same as being in deep space. You better bring a nice, sturdy container to hold air in. By the way, this will be your home forever. So try to make it as big as you can.</p> <p><b>2: You&#x2019;re going to need oxygen.</b></p> <p>You probably plan to breathe during your stay, so you&#x2019;ll need to have something in that pressure vessel. Fortunately, you can get this from Mars itself. The atmosphere is very thin, but it is present and it&#x2019;s almost entirely carbon dioxide. There are lots of ways to strip the carbon off carbon dioxide and liberate the oxygen. You could have complex mechanical oxygenators or you could just grow some plants. </p> <p><b>3: You&#x2019;re going to need radiation shielding. </b></p> <p>Earth&#x2019;s liquid core gives it a magnetic field that protects us from most of the nasty crap the sun pukes out at us. Mars has no such luxury. All kinds of solar radiation gets to the surface. Unless you&#x2019;re a fan of cancer, you&#x2019;re going to want your accommodations to be radiation-shielded. The easiest way to do that is to bury your base in Martian sand and rocks. They&#x2019;re not exactly in short supply, so you can just make the pile deeper and deeper until it&#x2019;s blocking enough. </p> <p><b>4: You&#x2019;re going to need water. </b></p> <p>Again, Mars provides. The Curiosity probe recently discovered that Martian soil has quite a lot of ice in it. About 35 liters per cubic meter. All you need to do is scoop it up, heat it, and strain out the water. Once you have a good supply, a simple distillery will allow you to reuse it over and over. </p> <p><b>5: You&#x2019;re going to need food. </b></p> <p>Just eat Martians. They taste like chicken. </p> <p><b>6: Oh, come on. </b></p> <p>All right, all right. Food is the one thing you need that can&#x2019;t be found in abundance on Mars. You&#x2019;ll have to grow it yourself. But you&#x2019;re in luck, because Mars is actually a decent place for a greenhouse. The day/night cycle is almost identical to Earth&#x2019;s, which Earth plants evolved to optimize for. And the total solar energy hitting the surface is enough for their needs. </p> <p>But you can&#x2019;t just grow plants on the freezing, near-vacuum surface. You&#x2019;ll need a pressure container for them as well. And that one might have to be pretty big. Just think of how much food you eat in a year and imagine how much space it takes to grow it. </p> <p>Hope you like potatoes. They&#x2019;re the best calorie yield per land area.</p> <p><b>7: You&#x2019;re going to need energy. </b></p> <p>However you set things up, it won&#x2019;t be a self-contained system. Among other things, you&#x2019;ll need to deal with heating your home and greenhouse. Mars&#x2019;s average daily temperature is -50C (-58F), so it&#x2019;ll be a continual energy drain to keep warm. Not to mention the other life support systems, most notably your oxygenator. And if you&#x2019;re thinking your greenhouse will keep the atmosphere in balance, think again. A biosphere is far too risky on this scale. </p> <p><b>8: You&#x2019;re going to need a reason to be there. </b></p> <p>Why go out of your way to risk your life? Do you want to study the planet itself? Start your own civilization? Exploit local resources for profit? Make a base with a big death ray so you can address the UN while wearing an ominous mask and demand ransom? Whatever your goal is, you better have it pretty well defined, and you better really mean it. Because in the end, Mars is a harsh, dangerous place and if something goes wrong you&#x2019;ll have no hope of rescue. Whatever your reason is, it better be worth it. </p>ANDY WEIR was first hired as a programmer for a national laboratory at age fifteen and has been working as a software engineer ever since.

A fierce fighter in four critical Revolutionary War battles and a courageous survivor of Valley Forge and a near-fatal wound at the Battle of Trenton, James Monroe (1751&#x2013;1831) went on to become America's first full-time politician, dedicating his life to securing America's national and international durability.<p>Decorated by George Washington for his exploits as a soldier, Monroe became a congressman, a senator, U.S. minister to France and Britain, governor of Virginia, secretary of state, secretary of war, and finally America's fifth president. The country embraced Monroe's dreams of empire and elected him to two terms, the second time unanimously. Mentored by each of America's first four presidents, Monroe was unquestionably the best prepared president in our history.</p><p>Like David McCullough's <i>John Adams</i> and Jon Meacham's recent book on Andrew Jackson, this new biography of Monroe is both a solid read and stellar scholarship&#x2014;history in the grand tradition.</p></p><p>A veteran journalist, broadcaster, educator, and historian, <b>Harlow Giles Unger</b> is the author of fifteen books, including four biographies of America's Founding Fathers.

Whether writing about the murky world of arms dealers, the shadowy Nazi underground movement, or the intricacies of worldwide drug cartels, every plot has been chillingly plausible because every detail has been minutely researched.<br><br>But what most people don&#x2019;t know is that some of his greatest stories of intrigue have been in his own life.<br><br>He was the RAF&#x2019;s youngest pilot at the age of nineteen, barely escaped the wrath of an arms dealer in Hamburg, got strafed by a MiG during the Nigerian civil war, landed during a bloody coup in Guinea-Bissau (and was accused of helping fund a 1973 coup in Equatorial Guinea). The Stasi arrested him, the Israelis feted him, the IRA threatened him, and a certain attractive Czech secret police agent&#x2014;well, her actions were a bit more intimate. And that&#x2019;s just for starters.<br>It is a memoir like no other&#x2014;and a book of pure delight.</p><p><b>Frederick Forsyth</b> is the author of fifteen novels, from 1971&#x2019;s <i><i>The Day of the Jackal</i> </i>to 2013&#x2019;s <i><i>The Kill List</i></i>, and two short story collections.

Forsyth lives in England.***This excerpt is from an advance uncorrected proof***<br><br>Copyright&nbsp;� 2015 Frederick Forsyth<p>WHISPERED WORDS</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My father was born in 1906, the eldest son of a frequently absent Chief Petty Officer, Royal Navy, in Chatham, Kent, and emerged at twenty from the Dockyard School to an economy that was creating one job for every ten young men in the labor pool. The other nine were destined for the dole queue.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had studied to be a naval architect, but as the Great Depression loomed, no one wanted ships to be built. The Hitlerian threat had not materialized and there were more merchant ships than anyone needed to carry the diminishing industrial product. After five years scraping a living from little more than odd jobs, he followed the popular advice of the age: Go East, Young Man. He applied for and secured a post as a rubber planter in Malaya.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today it would seem strange to appoint a young man with not a word of Malay nor knowledge of the Orient to go to the other end of the world to manage many thousands of acres of plantation and a large labour force of Malays and Chinese. But those were the days of empire, when such challenges were perfectly normal.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So he packed his things, said goodbye to his parents and took ship for Singapore. He learned Malay and the intricacies of estate management and rubber production, and ran his estate for five years. Each day, he wrote a love letter to the girl with whom he had been &#x201c;walking out,&#x201d; as they called dating back then, and she wrote to him. The next liner from Britain to Singapore brought the week&#x2019;s supply of letters and they came to the estate in Johore on the weekly riverboat.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life was lonely and isolated, illuminated by the weekly motorcycle ride south through the jungle, out onto the main road, across the causeway and into Changi for a convivial evening at the planters&#x2019; club. His estate consisted of a huge tract of rubber trees set in parallel rows and surrounded by jungle which was home to tigers, black panthers, and the much-feared <i>hamadryad</i> or king cobra. There was no car, because the track to the main road ten miles through the jungle was a narrow, winding line of red laterite gravel, so he rode a motorcycle.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was the village in which the labour force of Chinese tappers lived with their wives and families. And like any village there were a few craftsmen &#x2013; a butcher, a baker, a blacksmith and so forth.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stuck it for four years until it became plain there was little enough future in it. Rubber had slumped on the market. European rearmament had not yet started, but the new synthetics were taking more and more market share. The planters were asked to take a twenty percent salary cut as a condition of continued employment. For the bachelors, the choice was either send for their fianc�es to come and join them, or to go home to England. By 1935, he was havering between the two when something happened.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night his houseboy roused him with a request.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Tuan, the village carpenter is outside. He begs to see you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The routine was usually rise at five, tour the estate for two hours, then the morning reception when he would sit on the verandah and hear any petitions, complaints or adjudications in quarrels. Because of the early rise, he turned in at nine p.m. and this request was after ten o&#x2019;clock. He was about to say &#x201c;In the morning&#x201d; when it occurred to him that if it could not wait, it might be serious.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Bring him in,&#x201d; he said. The houseboy demurred.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He will not come, <i>tuan</i>. He is not worthy.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father rose, opened the screen door and went out to the verandah. Outside, the tropical night was warm velvet and the mosquitos voracious. Standing in a pool of light below the verandah was the village carpenter, a Japanese, the only one in the village. My father knew he had a wife and child and they never mixed with anyone. The man bowed deeply.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It is my son, <i>tuan</i>. The boy is very ill. I fear for him.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad called for lanterns and they went to the village. The child was about ten and wracked with pain from his stomach. His mother, an agonized face, crouched in the corner.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father was no doctor, not even a paramedic, but a compulsory course of first aid and a clutch of medical textbooks gave him enough knowledge to recognize acute appendicitis. It was pitch black and closing on midnight. Changi hospital was eighty miles away, but he knew that if appendicitis turned to peritonitis, it would kill.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ordered his motorcycle brought out, fully fuelled. The father used his wife&#x2019;s broad sash, the obi, to fasten the child on the pillion, tied to my father&#x2019;s back, and he set off. He told me later it was a hellish journey, for all the predators hunt at night. It was nearly an hour down the rutted track to the main road, then due south for the Causeway.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dawn was close to breaking some hours later when he rolled into the forecourt of Changi General Hospital, yelling for someone to come and help him. Nursing staff appeared and wheeled the child away. By luck, a British doctor was coming off night shift, but took one look and rushed the boy to surgery.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor joined my father for tiffin in the canteen and told him he had been just in time. The appendix was just about to burst, with probably lethal results. But the boy would live and was even then asleep. He gave the obi back.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After re-fuelling, my father rode back to his estate to reassure the impassive but hollow-eyed parents and catch up with the delayed day&#x2019;s work. A fortnight later, the riverboat brought the mail package, the usual stores, and a small Japanese boy with a shy smile and a scar.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four days later, the carpenter appeared again, this time in daylight. He was waiting near the bungalow when Dad returned from the latex store for tea. He kept his eyes on the ground as he spoke.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;<i>Tuan</i>, my son will live. In my culture when a man owes what I owe you, he must offer the most valuable thing that he has. But I am a poor man and have nothing to offer save one thing. Advice.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he raised his eyes and stared my father in the face.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Leave Malaya,<i> tuan</i>. If you value your life, leave Malaya.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the end of his days in 1991, my father never knew if those words caused his decision or merely reinforced it. But the next year, 1936, instead of sending for his fianc�e, he resigned and came home. In 1941, Imperial Japanese forces invaded Malaya. In 1945, of all his contemporaries, not one came home from the camps.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was nothing spontaneous about the Japanese invasion of Malaya. It was meticulously planned and the imperial forces swept down the peninsular as an unstoppable tide. British and Australian troops were rushed up the spine of the colony to man defensive points along the main roads south. But the Japanese did not come that way.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the rubber estates came scores of sleeper agents, infiltrated years before. On hundreds of bicycles, the Japanese rode south along tiny, unknown jungle tracks, guided by the agents. Others came by sea, leapfrogging down the coast, guided inshore by winking lanterns held by fellow countrymen who knew the coast and all the inlets.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The British and Australians were outflanked over and over again as the Japanese appeared behind them, and in strength, always guided by the agents. It was all over in days and the supposedly impregnable fortress of Singapore was taken from the landward side, her massive guns facing out to sea.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a child but old enough to understand, my father told me this story and swore it was absolutely true and it happened nearly seven years before the invasion of December 1941. But he was never quite certain that his village carpenter was one of those agents, only that had he been taken, he, too, would have died.&nbsp; So perhaps a few whispered words from a grateful carpenter caused me to appear on this earth at all. Since 1945, the Japanese have been held responsible for many things, but surely not this as well?</p><br><p>A LARGE JAR OF TALC</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The spring of 1940 was not a relaxing time to be in East Kent. Hitler had swept across Europe. France was overrun in three weeks. Denmark and Norway were gone, Belgium, Luxembourg and Holland swallowed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The outflanked British army in France had been driven into the sea off Dunkirk and Calais, and only rescued, minus all their equipment, by a miracle of small inshore boats manned by civilians who chugged across the Channel from the English coast and brought 330,000 of them off the sand dunes against all the odds.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Europe was either occupied by Hitler, putting into office servile collaborator governments, or sheltering in their neutrality. The British prime minister had been tossed out, to be replaced by Winston Churchill, who vowed we would fight on. But with what? Britain was completely isolated and alone.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Kent waited for the invasion, the famed Operation Sealion which, on Eagle Day, would see the German army roar up the beaches to invade, conquer and occupy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father had already volunteered for the army, but still based in his native Kent and living at home. He and my mother decided that if it came, they would not survive. They would use the last gallon of petrol in the old Wolsey and, with a length of hose, end their lives. But they did not want to take me with them. With my crown of blond curls, I would be accepted by the Nazis as of good Aryan stock and raised in an orphanage. But how to see me safely evacuated somewhere else?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution came in one of the customers at my mother&#x2019;s dress shop. She was the principal of the Norland Institute, the training school of the famous Norland nannies who for decades had gone out to raise the children of the rich and royal worldwide. The Institute was at Hothfield, a village outside Ashford. It was going to evacuate to Devon, far away in the southwest. My mother put it to her client: would they take me with them?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal was dubious, but her deputy proposed to her that nannies in training would always need babies to practice on, so why not this one? The deal was done. When the train bearing the Norland Institute steamed out of Ashford, I went with them. May 1940: I was twenty months old.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is hard to describe in the modern world, or explain to the new generation, the anguish of those parents as Ashford was emptied of its evacuees, seen off by weeping mothers and a few fathers who thought never to see them again. But that was the way it was on Ashford station.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot recall those five months I was in Devon, as class after class of eager young nannies experimented at putting me to bed, getting me up, and constantly changing my nappies. That was before velcro fastenings and absorbent padding. It was all terry-towelling and pins back then.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems I could hardly pass wind or let go a few drops before the whole lot came off to be replaced by a new one. And the standby was talc: lots and lots of talc. I must have had the most talc-dusted rear end in the kingdom.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Few in their Spitfires and Hurricanes did the job. On September 15th, Adolf simply gave up. His vast army on the French coast turned round, took a last look at the white cliffs across the Channel which they would not conquer after all, and marched east. Hitler was preparing his June 1941 invasion of Russia. The landing barges bobbed uselessly at their moorings off Boulogne and Calais.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sealion was off; Eagle Day would not happen.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our photographic recce planes noted this and reported back. England was saved or at least saved to struggle on. But the Luftwaffe bombing raids on London and the southeast would not cease. Most of the evacuated children would stay far from their parents, but at least with a good chance of reunification one day.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My own parents had had enough. They sent for me and back I came, to spend the rest of the war in the family home in Elwick Road, Ashford. I recall none of this, not the going away, the ceaseless attention to the nether parts in Devon, nor the return. But something must have struck in the subconscious. It took years until I ceased to feel trepidation every time I was approached by a beaming young lady with a large jar of talc.</p><br><p>A LITTLE BOY&#x2019;S DREAM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The summer of 1944 brought two great excitements to a small boy of five in East Kent. The nightly droning of German bombers overhead, heading from the French coast for the target of London, had ceased as the Royal Air Force won back control of the skies. The rhythmic throb-throb of the V1 rockets or dood...</p></p><h2>I Write What I Like: A Selection of His Writings</h2><p>Gathers articles, lectures, trial testimonies, letters, and selected writings by an outspoken critic of apartheid of died of a head injury while in the custody of the South African police</p><p>"The most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed." Like all of Steve Biko's writings, those words testify to the passion, courage, and keen insight that made him one of the most powerful figures in South Africa's struggle against apartheid. They also reflect his conviction that black people in South Africa could not be liberated until they united to break their chains of servitude, a key tenet of the Black Consciousness movement that he helped found.<br><br><i>I Write What I Like</i> contains a selection of Biko's writings from 1969, when he became the president of the South African Students' Organization, to 1972, when he was prohibited from publishing. The collection also includes a preface by Archbishop Desmond Tutu; an introduction by Malusi and Thoko Mpumlwana, who were both involved with Biko in the Black Consciousness movement; a memoir of Biko by Father Aelred Stubbs, his longtime pastor and friend; and a new foreword by Professor Lewis Gordon.<br><br>Biko's writings will inspire and educate anyone concerned with issues of racism, postcolonialism, and black nationalism.<br>Steve Biko was one of the foremost figures in South Africa&#39;s struggle for liberation from the apartheid regime. Murdered by the police when he was only 30, he had already established himself as a leader through his work as a political activist and his writings on Black Consciousness. I Write What I Like was first published in 1978 shortly after his brutal murder in detention. This collection of writings displays all the qualities which have made Biko one of the most influential thinkers in contemporary South African politics - a profound humanity, passionate conviction, humour and courage.</p><h2>The Banished Immortal: A Life of Li Bai (Li Po)</h2><p>From the National Book Award-winning author of <i>Waiting</i>: a narratively driven, deeply human biography of the Tang dynasty poet Li Bai&#x2014;also known as Li Po<br><br>In his own time (701&#x2013;762), Li Bai's poems&#x2014;shaped by Daoist thought and characterized by their passion, romance, and lust for life&#x2014;were never given their&nbsp;proper due by the official literary gatekeepers. Nonetheless, his lines rang out on the lips of court entertainers, tavern singers, soldiers, and writers throughout the Tang dynasty, and his deep desire for a higher, more perfect world gave rise to his nickname, the Banished Immortal. Today, Bai's verses are still taught to China's schoolchildren and recited at parties and toasts; they remain an inextricable part of the Chinese language.<br><br>With the instincts of a master novelist, Ha Jin draws on a wide range of historical and literary sources to weave the great poet's life story. He follows Bai from his origins on the&nbsp;western frontier to his ramblings travels as a young man, which were filled with filled with striving but also with merry abandon, as he raised cups of wine with friends and fellow poets. Ha Jin also takes us through the poet's later years&#x2014;in which he became swept up in a military rebellion that altered the course of China's history&#x2014;and the mysterious circumstances of his&nbsp;death, which are surrounded by legend.<br><i><br>The Banished Immortal</i> is an extraordinary portrait of a poet who both transcended his time and was shaped by it, and whose ability to live, love, and mourn without reservation produced some of the most enduring verses.</p><p><b>HA JIN</b> left his native China in 1985 to attend Brandeis University. He is the author of eight novels, four story collections, four volumes of poetry, and a book of essays. He has received the National Book Award, two PEN/Faulkner Awards, the PEN/Hemingway Foundation Award, the Asian American Literary Award, and the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction. In 2014 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He lives in the Boston area and is a professor at the creative writing program at Boston University.<b>Prelude</b><br><br>He has many names. In the West, people call him Li Po, as most of his poems translated into English bear that name. Sometimes it is also spelled Li Bo. But in China, he is known as Li Bai. During his lifetime (701&#x2013;762 AD), he had other names&#x2014;Li Taibai, Green Lotus Scholar, Li Twelve. The last one is a kind of familial term of endearment, as Bai was twelfth among his broth�ers and male cousins on the paternal side. It was often used by his friends and fellow poets when they addressed him&#x2014;some even dedicated poems to him titled &#x201c;For Li Twelve.&#x201d; By the time of his death, he had become known as a great poet and was called <i>zhexian, </i>or Banished Immortal, by his admirers. Such a moniker implies that he had been sent down to earth as punishment for his misbehavior in heaven. Over the twelve centuries since his death, he has been revered as <i>shixian, </i>Poet Immortal. Because he was an excessive drinker, he was also called <i>jiuxian, </i>Wine Immortal. Today it is still common for devotees of his poetry to trek hun�dreds of miles, following some of the routes of his wanderings as a kind of pilgrimage. Numerous liquors and wines bear his name. Indeed, his name is a ubiquitous brand, flaunted by hotels, restau�rants, temples, and even factories.<br>&nbsp;<br>In English, in addition to &#x201c;Li Po,&#x201d; he once had another pair of names, Li T&#x2019;ai Po and Rihaku. The first is a phonetic transcription of his original Chinese name, Li Taibai, the name his parents gave him. And Ezra Pound, in his <i>Cathay</i>&#x2014;his collected translations of classical Chinese poetry&#x2014;called Li Bai <i>Rihaku </i>because Pound had translated those poems from the notes left by the American scholar Ernest Fenollosa, who had originally studied Li Bai&#x2019;s poetry in Japanese when he was in Japan. Pound&#x2019;s loose translation of Li Bai&#x2019;s &#x201c;The River-Merchant&#x2019;s Wife: A Letter&#x201d; has been included in many textbooks and anthologies as a masterpiece of modern poetry. It is also one of Pound&#x2019;s signature poems&#x2014;arguably his best known. For the sake of consistency and clarity, in the follow�ing pages let us stay with the name Li Bai.<br>&nbsp;<br>He also has several deaths ascribed to him. For hundreds of years, some people even maintained that he had never died at all, claiming to encounter him now and then. In truth, we are uncer�tain about the exact date and cause of his death. In January 764, the newly enthroned Emperor Daizong issued a decree summon�ing Li Bai to serve as a counselor at court. It was a post without actual power in spite of its high-sounding title. Yet to any man of learning and ambition such an appointment was a great favor, a demonstration of the emperor&#x2019;s benevolence and magnanimity&#x2014;and in Li Bai&#x2019;s case, a partial restoration of the high status he had once held in the court. When the royal decree reached Dangtu County, Anhui, where Li Bai was supposed to be located, the local officials were thrown into confusion and could not find him. Soon it was discovered that he had died more than a year before. Of what cause and on what day, no one could tell. So we can only say that Li Bai, despite his renown, passed away in 762 without notice.<br>&nbsp;<br>However, such an obscure death was not acceptable to those who cherished his poetry. They began to give different versions of his death, stories spun either to suit the romantic image of his poetic personality or to provide a fitting conclusion to his turbu�lent life. In one version, he died of alcohol poisoning; this was in keeping with his lifelong indulgence in drink. Another claims that he died of an illness known as chronic thoracic suppuration&#x2014;pus penetrating his chest and lungs. The first mention of this comes from Pi Rixiu (838&#x2013;883) in his poem &#x201c;Seven Loves&#x201d;: &#x201c;He was brought down by rotted ribs, / Which sent his drunken soul to the other world.&#x201d; Although there is no way we can verify this claim, it sounds credible&#x2014;such a chest problem could have been caused by his abuse of alcohol. In his final years, Li Bai&#x2019;s drinking and poverty would have aggravated his pulmonary condition. But the third version of his death is far more fantastic: in this version, he drowns while drunkenly chasing the moon&#x2019;s reflection on a river, jumping from a boat to catch the ever-shifting orb.<br>&nbsp;<br>Even though this scene smacks of suicide and is perhaps too romantic to be believed, it is the version that has been embraced by the public&#x2014;in part because Li Bai, as his poetry shows, loved the moon. Even in his early childhood he was fixated on it. In his poem &#x201c;Night Trip in Gulang,&#x201d; he writes, &#x201c;As a young child, I had no idea what the moon was / And I called it a white jade plate. / Then I wondered if it was a mirror at the Jasper Terrace / That flew away and landed on top of green clouds.&#x201d; In Chinese poetry, Li Bai was the first to use the image of the moon abundantly, celebrat�ing its loftiness, purity, and constancy. He imagined the moon as a serene landscape with sublime dwellings for <i>xian, </i>or immor�tals, who are often surrounded by divine fauna and flora and their personal pets. The beliefs of the ancient Chinese did not sepa�rate divinity from humanity, and their imagined heavenly space resembled the human world, with similar (but more fantastic) landscapes and architecture and creatures. If cultivated enough, any human being could rise to the order of divinity, becoming a <i>xian</i>&#x2014;many temples in China worshiped these kinds of local dei�ties. Heaven was inhabited by these beings, who were somewhat like superhumans, powerful and carefree and immortal. <br>&nbsp;<br>The moon in Li Bai&#x2019;s poetry is also associated with one&#x2019;s home or native place, and as a beacon shared by people everywhere, universal and ever reliable&#x2014;&#x201c;Raising my head, I see the bright moon, / And lowering it, I think of home&#x201d; (&#x201c;Reflection in a Quiet Night&#x201d;). The legend of his attempt to embrace the moon suggests an ultimate fulfillment of his wish and vision&#x2014;a reversed spiritual ascent. Some of his contemporaries believed him to have been a star in his previous life, and so by joining the moon in the water, he returned to the heavenly space where he had once dwelled. The brief &#x201c;Li Bai Biography&#x201d; in the eleventh-century book <i>New Tang History </i>reads, &#x201c;When giving birth to Li Bai, his mother dreamed of the star Venus, so he was named Taibai (Venus).&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The poets who came after him have continued to celebrate his moonlit death: even though they know it may not be true, across the centuries they have eulogized the shining moment in their verses. Even today, lovers of Li Bai&#x2019;s poetry indulge in the myth. One contemporary scholar writes that Li Bai &#x201c;rode a whale, floating away with the waves, toward the moon.&#x201d; This heaven�ward journey is presented from the distraught, drunken poet&#x2019;s point of view so that Li Bai appears to be returning to his original, divine position. Such romanticization shows the nature of scholar�ship around Li Bai, which is partly based on legends and myths. Because people want him to have a glorious end, they have been eager to perpetuate the moon-chasing legend. <br>&nbsp;<br>However, for all the imaginative attempts to glorify him, a sin�gle clear voice spoke about his situation presciently when the poet was still alive and in exile. His staunch friend Du Fu laments in his poem &#x201c;Dreaming of Li Bai&#x201d;:<br><br>&#x51a0;&#x84cb;&#x6eff;&#x4eac;&#x83ef; &#x65af;&#x4eba;&#x7368;&#x6194;&#x60b4; <br>&#x5b70;&#x4e91;&#x7db2;&#x6062;&#x6062; &#x5c07;&#x8001;&#x8eab;&#x53cd;&#x7d2f; <br>&#x5343;&#x79cb;&#x842c;&#x6b72;&#x540d; &#x5bc2;&#x5bde;&#x8eab;&#x5f8c;&#x4e8b;<br>&#x300a;&#x5922;&#x674e;&#x767d;&#x300b;<br>&nbsp;<br> <i>The capital is full of gorgeous carriages and gowns,</i><br> <i>But you are alone gaunt and sallow despite your gift.</i><br> <i>Who is to say that the way of heaven is always fair?</i><br> <i>At your old age you can&#x2019;t stay clear of harm.</i><br> <i>Your fame that&#x2019;s to last ten thousand years</i><br> <i>Will become a quiet affair after you are gone.</i></p><h2>The Mexican Tree Duck</h2><p>A blood-encrusted ceramic figure is at the center of private investigator C. W. Sughrue&#39;s search through the American West for the missing mother of his Vietnam buddy. By the author of The Wrong Case. 50,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p>James Crumley has taught English at the University of Montana and has been Visiting Writer at the University of Texas at El Paso and Carnegie Mellon University.When the 3:12 through freight to Spokane hit the East Meriwether crossing, the engineer touched his horn and released a long, mournful wail into the wet, snowy air of our second early fall storm in western Montana. It sounded a hell of a lot like the first note of a Hank Snow ballad. I slipped the dolly from under the jukebox and plugged it into the extension cord. When I dropped a quarter into the slot, the large machine burped, the bubbling neon tubes glowed softly in the night, and the machine seemed to settle more solidly onto the railroad tracks.<br><br>&#x201c;You sure you know what you&#x2019;re doing, Sughrue?&#x201d; Lawyer Rainbolt asked, squatting beside the roadbed.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, man, I don&#x2019;t know who this supposed rock-�and-�roll guy is and I don&#x2019;t even much care if he sings like a girl,&#x201d; I maintained, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;ve shaken hands with Hank Snow, by god . . .&#x201d; I waved the damaged Herradura tequila bottle across the white space of the parking lot toward the back of the Hell Roaring Liquor Store and Lounge. &#x201c;. . . right over there, and they ain&#x2019;t got no right to take him off the jukebox.&#x201d;<br><br>Solly took the tequila from me, had a hit, then handed it back, and dumped a small but dangerous pile of crystal meth into the palm of his scarred hand. He glanced up, smiling, huge snowflakes melting in his shaggy blond hair. &#x201c;Which one is he?&#x201d; Solly asked. &#x201c;All those country and western singers sound like girls to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Asshole.&#x201d;<br><br>Solly was very amused, grinning like the cat that fucked the canary before he ate it. Fucking amused lawyers.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do it before it blows away,&#x201d; he suggested.<br><br>I make it a policy never to argue with drug lawyers: they have decent arguments and the best drugs.<br><br>So we knelt together as the engine came around the long curve at the base of the Devil&#x2019;s Hump, its brilliant headlamp whipping through the snow-�cursed night, knelt and snorted the speed off the circular cicatrix in Solly&#x2019;s palm. I stood up, shakily, stepped onto the tracks, and punched P-�17. Solly limped across the parking lot toward the shadowed rear of the bar as the engineer hit his heavy note one more time.<br><br>The first time I saw Solomon Rainbolt, he was dead. Or we thought he was. The base camp CP bunker had taken at least three direct RPG hits, and after forty-�eight hours under the monsoon rain, we couldn&#x2019;t tell the bodies from the sandbags. When one of the muddy lumps opened a pair of red-�rimmed eyes and grinned, white-�toothy and wild, one of my FNGs shit his pants and touched off an M-�16 clip into the clotted Vietnamese sky before Willie Williams could grab him. Then the lump became a head, raised itself, grinning.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Sarge,&#x201d; it said in a deep southern accent, &#x201c;where the fuck you guys been?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, sir,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but the rain held us up . . .&#x201d; I had the lead squad of a company patrol at the end of a four-�day hump into the dark heart of the Central Highlands. Our choppers had been grounded by the monsoon, and the regiment had pushed us hard to get to the overrun ARVN position, not to garner survivors but to dig the code safe out of the CP. Solly was the bonus upon which no one had counted. &#x201c;. . . and nobody knew you were waiting.&#x201d;<br><br>Solly shook his head as if coming back from death hadn&#x2019;t been all that pleasant, then he struggled out of the sucking mud, shifting aside the dead Rhade mercenary who lay across his legs, pulling his lanky frame upright. Then he held up his left hand and clenched his fist. Even in the rain, I could hear the bones grind against each other. A ribbony snake of blood drifted out of his tight, muddy fingers and down his thick wrist.<br><br>&#x201c;Captain Solomon Rainbolt,&#x201d; he said as he looked at us, &#x201c;bound for the free world.&#x201d; Then he stared at the remains of his advisory command. Only he had survived. By playing dead, perfectly. Suddenly, Solly laughed, thunderous in the hammering rain, squeezed his fist again, and shouted, &#x201c;Pin my Purple fucking Heart to my ass, boys, and send me home!&#x201d;<br><br>They pinned it to his chest, though. And some other chicken-�shit baubles, too. But he left most of his lower left leg there floating in a rice paddy and he didn&#x2019;t find his way back to the free world for a long time. He did one more tour for the green weenie, then another long one as one of those spooky hard-�assed dudes dressed in tiger-�striped tailored fatigues, Swedish assault rifles, and eyes from hell.<br><br>But finally, he came home. Not to Athens, Georgia, though, where his mother taught chemistry and his father law, but to California and law school at Boalt in Berkeley, where he kicked ass and took names, just as he had in the war, a joy he continued as a federal prosecutor and then in private practice in San Francisco once he had tacked his sheepskin like another military bauble to his wall.<br><br>By then, I was back on the mean streets of home my own damn self, busy with my own troubles, so our paths didn&#x2019;t cross for a long time. At one point I had tracked a runaway wife from Wichita to San Francisco, where I found her among the remains of the flower children. I stayed for the end of the era of peace and love, stayed until Tricky Dick Nixon gave up his political ghost and left the sixties without purpose.<br><br>Solly&#x2019;s name appeared in the paper, so I went to court to watch him work one afternoon. He was defending a rather famous biker against a murder-�one charge. Solly was something to see&#x2014;�a half-�Jewish, half-�peckerwood, half-�crippled war hero. One of the courthouse buffs whispered to me that Solly could make a jury eat his shorts and convince them it was fettuccine Alfredo. He never lost a murder case that went to trial, and his plea bargains were taught in law schools all over the country.<br><br>I stopped by the defense table to say hello after the jury acquitted his client, and he seemed glad to see me. It looked as if it might be easy to renew the friendship we had begun during the four-�day two-�ambush hump out of the bush. So we exchanged numbers, promised to call. But I went to Vegas on a skip-�trace and when I got back, Solly had dropped suddenly out of the public view. There were rumors of an acrimonious divorce, a dead child, a missing ex-�wife.<br><br>Solly eventually reappeared in Denver, where he specialized in defending heavy drug dealers, guys who moved serious weight. He seemed to have a real hard-�on for the DEA, and he kicked the government&#x2019;s ass with disturbing regularity. When he had taken whatever revenge he intended&#x2014;�I don&#x2019;t know because we never talked about it&#x2014;�he cooled his jets and moved his practice to Meriwether, Montana, a town I had called home for a while now, and we picked up that friendship we had left in the bush. Friends, true, maybe even running buddies, so I made it a practice never to work either for him or against him. He seemed to agree. However brief our time in the bush, we both clung to the notion that it was better to have a buddy to watch your back when the hump got tough.<br><br>And things got tough for me that year. The PI business died with a blizzard the third week of September that dumped sixteen inches of cold wet snow on Meriwether. People seemed to be able to divorce quite nicely without my help during the cold snap and icy drizzle that followed the blizzard. Those local merchants who might have had repossession on their minds chose to be nasty to deadbeats up close and personal.<br><br>I wouldn&#x2019;t have had time, anyway. The part-�time bartending job at the Hell Roaring Liquor Store and Lounge that kept me fairly solvent had degenerated into a full-�time chore as the customers lurched madly toward the stone-�cold heart of winter. The owner of the Hell Roaring, Leonard the Sly, a man whose heart usually only sang with the music of the cash register, suddenly fell in love with Betty Boobs, our prettiest cocktail waitress. They fled to Mexico before the first snowflake hit the ground. God knows what Leonard thought. Perhaps he thought his wife, Betty Books, who kept them, might not notice their absence. No such luck. A week later, she picked up the weekend cash deposit bag and climbed on an airplane bound eventually for Fiji, muttering something about &#x201c;revenge fucking in the third world.&#x201d; But she said quite plainly to me, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s yours, C.W. Drink it up or burn it down&#x2014;�I just don&#x2019;t give a shit anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t have time to do either. The help, surly in the best of times, rankled quickly under my guidance. When Big Linda&#x2019;s check was short the second week in a row, she responded by drop-�kicking a tray of drinks across a five o&#x2019;clock throng. One poor woman protested the death of her silk blouse, and Big Linda hit her so hard half of her houseplants died. Big Linda quit on the spot, moved to Tucson the next day to follow a career as a professional mud wrestler. All the mud in Meriwether was frozen. Little Linda followed quickly, packing her three kids and two broken television sets from four marriages into her old Falcon station wagon, with a large sign that said SNOW painted on the back window. She planned to drive south until somebody asked her what that was, that snow thing. Then the cruelest blow of all: my best, most experienced, most dependable bartender, the Original Linda, fell back in love with her second husband when he got out of Deer Lodge Prison. They got married, joined AA, and Linda quit her job.<br><br>Bars can be nice places, comfortable, homes away from the loneliness or confusion of home, but nobody, not even the most confirmed degenerate drunk, can spend eighty or ninety hours a week in one. I went through so much help that I actually hired a woman so drunk she had forgotten that I had fired her the week before. I don&#x2019;t know what my excuse was. Something to do with my nose, I suspect. As far as I was concerned, the sun was something that happened in another country. I didn&#x2019;t care if it came out. Then it did just to prove me wrong.<br><br>The first day, the snow melted like sugar in a golden shower. On the second afternoon it was all gone, and I had hammered my few customers with free drinks until they mostly sat still and silent, stunned in the flat rays of the lowering sun that flooded the front door of the Hell Roaring, an autumn light alive and full of hope and glory. I played every Hank Snow song on the jukebox ten times. Two of my semi-�mobile customers&#x2014;�an independant gypo-�logger with a broken leg and a real estate saleswoman with a broken arm&#x2014;�had fallen under the spell of the gravelly romantic voice; they danced with clumsy grace around the pool table. I could have danced myself.<br><br>A thousand years ago when I first came to Meriwether, the first time I set foot in the Hell Roaring as the sixties drifted, late as usual and dying, into the seventies, I found that soft autumn light filling the magic afternoon easiness of the bar. I eased myself onto the stool next to the poor schmuck I had been chasing for six months. He looked so pitiful I nearly walked away, but drink in hand, I swiveled around and stopped in that light, that sun-�filled silence.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t even remember his name. Just some wretch from Redwood City, California, a pale, wrinkled man, a pharmacist once, an unhappy man wedded to a woman hard with unhappy fat and a gut bucket for a mouth. The pharmacist read the wrong books, maybe, or watched the wrong television shows, whatever, he became convinced that the sexual revolution had taken place without him. So he faked a robbery, fled with the money and the drugs and a hippie chick with flowers in her hair, fled toward the peace and freedom of the Mountain West, Montana, the word like a benison on his trembling lips.<br><br>By the time I caught up with him, though, he had had enough of his dream. He should have been glad to go home. I bought him a drink and explained the hard way and the easy way back to California. He wept like a child, a man leaking everywhere, everything. He had a junkie&#x2019;s sniffles, oozing tracks inside his elbows, behind his knees, and between his toes. A revolutionary strain of gonorrhea had started a commune in his urinary tract and none of the miracles of modern pharmacy could dislodge it.<br><br>But it hadn&#x2019;t all leaked out. When I tried to console him with the information that his wife still loved him, wouldn&#x2019;t press charges, and wanted him back in the family home, he shook his head, murmured something about his additional curse of a weak bladder, then raised a flaky eyebrow and nodded toward the john.<br><br>Maybe if I hadn&#x2019;t turned my stool back to face that blessed light, I might have heard the muffled thumps from the bathroom. Five minutes later when I decided that not even the most painful piss should take that long, I went to check. He really wanted to die. I found him on his knees in front of the urinal, hanging from his belt, leaning into the leather strap. This time everything had finally leaked out.</p><h2>Workbook for Women: Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts - Seven Questions to Ask Before and After You Marry</h2><p>The Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts Workbook for Women will help you uncover and understand the unique shaping factors you bring into your marriage both as a woman and as an individual.

She had written four novels, including Wigs on the Green (1935), before the success of The Pursuit of Love in 1945, which she followed with Love in a Cold Climate (1949), The Blessing (1951) and Don&#39;t Tell Alfred (1960). She also wrote four works of biography. Nancy Mitford was awarded the CBE in 1972.I<br> <br> On the day which was to be such a turning-point in my life, I went to London by the 9.07. I had planned to do a little shopping; somebody had told me of Chinese robes in the sales, perfect for dinner at home since they would cover up everything. I was also going to see my naughty boy, Basil, a perennial worry to me; Aunt Sadie begged me to look in on Uncle Matthew and there was something I had long wanted to put to him. I had appointments to lunch with the one and to have tea with the other. It was a Saturday because that was Basil&#x2019;s half-holiday &#x2013; he was cramming for the Foreign Office. We were to meet at a restaurant, then go back to his lodgings, what used to be called &#x2018;rooms&#x2019; and is now called a &#x2018;service flat&#x2019;. My idea was to do a little, surely much needed, tidying up there, as well as to collect some dirty clothes, and bring them back with me to have them washed or cleaned. I took a large canvas hold-all to contain them and the Chinese robe, if I bought it. <br> &nbsp;<br> But, oh dear, I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever looked such a fool as I did in that Chinese robe, with my brown walking shoes, enormous beneath the hem, hair untidy from dragging off&nbsp; a hat, leather bag clasped to bosom because it had �28 in it and I knew that people snatched bags at sales. The assistant earnestly said think of the difference if I were carefully <i>coiff�e</i> and <i>maquill�e</i> and <i>parfum�e</i> and <i>manicur�e</i> and <i>pedicur�e</i>, wearing Chinese sandals (next department, 35/6) and lying on a couch in a soft light. It was no good, however &#x2013; my imagination could not get to work on all these hypotheses; I felt both hot and bothered; I tore the robe from me and fl ed from the displeasure of the saleswoman. <br> &nbsp;<br> I had made my plan with Basil some days before, on the telephone. Like all the children he is quite incapable of either reading or writing a letter. I was rather more worried about him than usual; last time he had come to Oxford his clothes had been distinctly on the Teddy side while his hair combed (or rather pulled) over his forehead and worn in a bob at the back gave him a curiously horrible look. This, no doubt, is now the fashion and not in itself a cause for alarm. But when he was alone with me he had spoken about his future, saying that the prospect of the Foreign Service bored him and that he thought he could put his talent for languages to better account in some other career. The sinister words &#x2018;get rich quick&#x2019; were uttered. I was anxious to see him again and ask a few questions. It was a blow, therefore, though not a great surprise, when he failed to turn up at the restaurant. I lunched there alone and then went off to find his service flat. The address he had given me, in Islington, turned out to be a pretty old house, come down in the world (soon no doubt to come down altogether). There were five or six bells at the front door with cards attached; one bell had no card but somebody had scribbed Baz on the wall beside it. I pressed it, without much hope. Nobody came. I went on pressing at intervals. <br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> A sharp lad in Teddy costume was lounging in the street, eyeing me. Presently he came up and said, &#x2018;If it&#x2019;s old Baz you&#x2019;re after, he&#x2019;s gone to Spain.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rain, rain, go to Spain. &#x2018;And when will he be back again?&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;When he comes for the next batch. Old Baz is a travel agent now, didn&#x2019;t you know? Joined up with his Grandad &#x2013; some people are lucky in their relations. Baz herds them out to the Costa Brava, goes into hiding while they live it up there and brings back the bodies a week later. Or that&#x2019;s the general idea &#x2013; he&#x2019;s only just started the work.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> Travel agent &#x2013; Grandad &#x2013; what did the child mean? Was not this a line of talk intended to keep me here until a man who was walking up the street should be out of sight? There was nobody else about, this dread Teddy, armed, no doubt, with blades, was clearly after my bag and the �28. I gave him a nervous, idiotic smile. &#x2018;Thank you very much,&#x2019; I said, &#x2018;that&#x2019;s just what I thought. Good-bye and thank you.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Upper Street was near and very soon I was in a good old No. 19 sagely ambling towards Piccadilly. This sort of thing always happened when I tried to see Basil. Oh well, one must put oneself in his shoes. Why should he want to spend his Saturday afternoon with a middle-aged mother? What a bore for a young man, on his own for the first time, to have to watch this elderly woman messing about in his room and taking away his suits. All the same, it was not like him to throw one over quite so callously; what could have happened? How could I find out? Meanwhile here I was in London on a Saturday afternoon with nothing to do until tea-time. We were passing the National Gallery, but I felt too dispirited to go in. I decided to walk off my bad temper in the Park. <br> &nbsp;<br> Though I have lived in London for longish periods at various times in my life, I have never been a Londoner, so that its associations to me are more literary and historic than personal. Every time I visit it I am saddened by seeing changes for the worse: the growing inelegance; the loss of character; the disappearance of landmarks and their replacement by fl at and faceless glass houses. When I got off my bus at Hyde Park Corner, I looked sadly at the huge hotel where Montdore House used to be, in Park Lane. When first built it had been hailed as a triumph of modern architecture, but although it had only stood there for three years it had already become shabby, the colour of old teeth, and in an odd way out of date. I stumped off towards Kensington Gardens. Somebody had told me that Knightsbridge Barracks were soon to go, so I said good-bye to them. I had never looked at them very carefully &#x2013; I now saw that they were solid and well built in a pretty mixture of brick and stone. No masterpiece, but certainly far better than the glorified garage that would replace them.

We meet Leah, the oldest daughter of Laban, whose "tender eyes" prevent her from fully participating in the daily work of her nomadic family, and Rachel, the spoiled younger daughter, the petted and privileged beauty of the family -- or so it seems to Leah.</p><p> There is also Bilhah, an orphan who is not quite a slave but not really a family member, a young woman desperately searching to fit in, and Zilpah, who knows only how to use her beauty to manipulate men as she strives to secure for herself something better than the life of drudgery and servitude into which she has been born. </p><p>Into the desert camp comes Jacob, a handsome and charismatic kinsman who is clearly destined to be Rachel's husband. But that doesn't prevent the other women from vying for his attention. </p><p>Tracing their lives from childhood to maturity, Card shows how these women change each other -- and are changed again by the holy books that Jacob brings with him. Ambition, jealousy, fear, and love motivate them as they vie for the attention of Jacob, heir to the spiritual birthright of Abraham and Isaac.</p></p><p><b>Orson Scott Card</b> is the author of the novels <i>Ender's Game</i>, <i>Ender's Shadow</i>, and <i>Speaker for the Dead</i>. <i>Ender's Game</i> and <i>Speaker for the Dead</i> both won Hugo and Nebula Awards, making Card the only author to win these two top prizes in consecutive years.

The Enemy Within chronicles the most prominent witch-hunts of the Western world?women and men who were targeted by suspicious neighbors and accused of committing horrific crimes by supernatural means?and shows how the fear of witchcraft has fueled recurrent cycles of accusation, persecution, and purging. A unique and fascinating book, it illumines the dark side of communities driven to rid themselves of perceived evil, no matter what the human cost.</p><p>John Demos is Samuel Knight Professor of history at Yale University. He is the author of several histories of early America, including <i>Entertaining Satan</i>, which was awarded the Bancroft Prize in American History, and The <i>Unredeemed Captive</i>, which received the Francis Parkman and Ray Allen Billington prizes in American history and was a finalist for the National Book Award. He lives in Tyringham, Massachusetts.For each of four instances of witch-hunting in Europe, early America, Salem (Massachusetts), and contemporary America, Demos provides the stories of two persons affected by it and an excellent overview of what historians know about each incidence and how they interpret documentary and other evidence. He presents several theories about witch-hunting, but as the title implies, he believes witch-hunting is a way of purging from within, specifically aimed at women and only collaterally at men connected to the targeted women. A witch-hunt, by Demos&#x2019; definition, finds women who represent something unsettling to society and punishes or kills them to &#x201c;cleanse&#x201d; the society. That witch-hunting is a form of misogyny is central to Demos&#x2019; argument, and when he examines recent &#x201c;witch-hunting&#x201d; episodes, he finds the term applicable only as a metaphor. Controversially, he argues that persecution of female day-care operators in the 1980s for alleged Satanism was witch-hunting, since at the time women needed day care because they were entering the workforce in numbers that constituted a socially destabilizing movement. Compelling, impressively researched history and argumentation. --Patricia Monaghan</p><h2>Codependence / The Dance of Wounded Souls</h2><p>This joyously inspirational Spiritual book presents a set of beliefs about the meaning and purpose of life from a Cosmic Perspective that combines Twelve Step Recovery Principles with Ancient Metaphysical Truths. It explains why a New Age has dawned in human consciousness on planet Earth and explores the interrelationship between subjects that range from the Bible, Buddha, and Jesus to quantum physics, molecular biology, and AIDS. The belief system the book is based upon is exemplified by this quote from The Dance of Wounded Souls: &#34;We are not sinful, shameful human creatures who have to somehow earn Spirituality. We are Spiritual Beings having a human experience. We are here to experience and learn, to Touch and to feel.&#34; The author, a therapist who specializes in codependence/inner child healing, not only explains the big picture of how we are all ONE, part of one Cosmic energy interaction that is unfolding perfectly, he also offers insights into how the individual being can lovingly change their relationship with self and life in order to transform their human experience into a much more enjoyable adventure. This is a life-changing, life-affirming book.</p><p>We feel that this is one of the most important books of our time. No one has ever explained the human dilemma as clearly and simply as The Dance of Wounded Souls. Many books are out which speak to the psychological condition that has come to be called codependence - this book is about the Spiritual wound that caused the psychological condition. It&#39;s purpose is to remind old souls of who they are, and why they are here in human body on this planet at this time. All old souls are now doing accelerated Karmic settlement in this New Age. Our mission to integrate Spirituality into our interactions. It is easy to feel Spiritual in relationship with nature. It is relating to other humans that is messy. That is because we learned how to do life and relationships in childhood. Through healing our childhood wounds we can learn to connect Spiritually and also, in the process, heal the planet. It is possible to feel the feelings without being the victim of them, or victimizing others with them. It is possible to change the way we think so that our mind is no longer our worst enemy. It is possible to become empowered to have choices in life at the same time we are letting go of trying to control life. Life can be an exciting, enjoyable adventure when we wake up to Spiritual Truth and integrate it into our day to day life so that we can stop reacting out of our childhood emotional wounds and dysfunctional attitudes!(From Authors Foreword to the book) When I first came into contact with the word "Codependent" over a decade ago, I did not think that the word had anything to do with me personally. At that time I heard the word used only in reference to someone who was involved with an Alcoholic - and since I was a Recovering Alcoholic, I obviously could not be Codependent. I paid only slightly more attention to the Adult Children of Alcoholics Syndrome, not because it applied to me personally - I was not from an Alcoholic family - but because many people whom I knew obviously fit the symptoms of that syndrome. It never occurred to me to wonder if the Adult Child Syndrome and Codependence were related. As my Recovery from Alcoholism progressed, however, I began to realize that just being clean and sober was not enough. I started to look for some other answers. By that time the conception of the Adult Child Syndrome had expanded beyond just pertaining to Alcoholic families. I started to realize that, although my family of origin had not been Alcoholic, it had indeed been dysfunctional. I had gone to work in the Alcoholism Recovery field by this time and was confronted daily with the symptoms of Codependence and Adult Child Syndrome. I recognized that the definition of Codependence was also expanding. As I continued my personal Recovery, and continued to be involved in helping others with their Recovery, I was constantly looking for new information. In reading the latest books and attending workshops, I could see a pattern emerging in the expansion of the terms "Codependent" and "Adult Child." I realized that these terms were describing the same phenomenon. I was troubled, however, by the fact that every book I read, and every expert with whom I came into contact defined "Codependence" differently. I began to try to discover, for my own personal benefit, one all-encompassing definition. This search led me to examine the phenomenon in an increasingly larger context. I began to look at the dysfunctional nature of society, and then expanded farther into looking at other societies. And finally to the human condition itself. The result of that examination is this book: <i>Codependence / The Dance of Wounded Souls, A Cosmic Perspective on Codependence and the Human Condition</i>. <p>This book is based upon a talk that I have been giving for the last few years. I have edited and reorganized, expanded, added, and clarified information in adapting the talk to book form, but there is still the flavor and style of a talk throughout much of this book. I have not attempted to change this for several reasons, the main reason being that it works in conveying the multi-leveled message that I wish to communicate. One of the reasons for the human dilemma, for the confusion that humans have felt about the meaning and purpose of life, is that more than one level of reality comes into play in the experience of being human. Trying to apply the Truth of one level to the experience of another has caused humans to become very confused and twisted in our perspective of the human experience. It is kind of like the difference between playing the one-dimensional chess that we are familiar with, and the three-dimensional chess played by the characters of Star Trek - they are two completely different games. That is the human dilemma - we have been playing the game with the wrong set of rules. With rules that do not work. With rules that are dysfunctional. I was terrified beyond description the first time I gave this talk in June of 1991. It seemed as if emotional memories of what it felt like to be stoned to death by an angry mob were assaulting my being. I went ahead with it anyway, because it is what I needed to do for myself. I needed to stand up in public and own my Truth. I needed to own the Truth that I had come to believe in, the Truth that worked for me to allow me to find some happiness, peace, and Joy in my life. I found that other people found Joy and peace in my message also. So now I share this message with you, the reader of this book, in the hopes that it will help you to remember the Truth of who you are, and why you are here. This information is not meant to be absolute or the final word - it is meant as an alternative perspective for you to consider. A Cosmic Perspective that just might help to make life an easier, more enjoyable experience for you.</p></p><h2>Sayonara, Mrs. Kackleman</h2><p>Lulu and her brother adore their Japanese tour highlighted by hotel rooms with futons and no shoes allowed, fish markets, and even a frog who writes haiku</p><p>In her own words: "born. bucolic childhood. culture-stuffed adolescence. played piano. stopped. danced. stopped. wrote. discarded writing. drew. reinstated writing. married Tibor Kalman and collaborated at iconoclastic yet successful design studio. wrote and painted children's books. worried. took up Ping-Pong. relaxed. wrote and painted for many magazines.&nbsp; cofounded the Rubber Band Society. amused. children: two. dog: one."While watching a performance of The Mikado , Alexander suggests to his older sister Lulu that perhaps they should visit Japan. Lulu, eager to avoid her piano lesson and her teacher, the dreaded Mrs. Kackleman, is only too happy to agree. The two arrive in Tokyo (without parents, you understand), and are bundled off in a red taxi driven by a gloved man with "sharp black hair." Images of houses and people, food and customs jumble together in a wild stream-of-consciousness travelogue that springs from the minds and lips of the irrepressible brother and sister. A man sitting on a park bench and a frog in a kimono reciting a haiku are as riveting as a visit to a Japanese school or communal bath house. The book is studded with many gems from the mouths of Lulu and Alexander, like the poem dedicated to their guide: "Hey Hiroko, are you loco? Would you like a cup of cocoa?" The unique and provocative illustrative style evidenced in Hey Willy, See the Pyramids flourishes in this new work, demonstrating a graphic brilliance that is fast becoming Kalman's hallmark. Her carefully orchestrated yet extravagantly kinetic paintings are crammed with details and characters ready to spill off each page.

Deryni Tales is a heartfelt tribute to the world she created-from the devoted fans who have made it their own.</p><p><b>Katherine Kurtz </b>has been writing fantasy for well over twenty-five years. She is married and lives in a renovated castle in the south of Ireland.Deryni's creator has combed the fanzine <i>Deryni Archives</i> for publishable fiction by the saga's devotees. By exercising sound judgment and drawing, it seems, on good raw material to begin with, she assembles a rewarding collection. Laura Jefferson's "A Midsummer's Questing" goes back to the days when Rhys and Evaine were courting and Joram was wrestling with his vocation. Daniel Kohanski and Jay Barry Azneer's "Arilan the Talmud Student" addresses the position of the Jews in the Eleven Kingdoms. Sharon Henderson's "Deo Volente" also addresses the question of vocation, this time Duncan McLain's, and the stories that succeed these proceed to a fine coda by Kurtz herself. Although they can't boast prose as elegant as Kurtz's, most of the other contributors are obviously more medievalists, historians, and in possession of richer spiritual lives than the average fantasy writer or fan. None of that will surprise the Deryni saga's long-term devotees, who may appreciate the volume more than may relative newcomers to this fantasy realm now 30 years in the making. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It is to weave together their beautiful traditions as whole.&#34; What emerged the next year was &#34;The Song of Hiawatha,&#34; a composite of legends, folklore, myth, and characters that presents, in short, lilting trochees, the life story of a real Indian, who provides the focus for the narrative thread of this epic drama of high adventure, tragedy, and conflict. The aim was not to tell a particular or specific story, but to unite the strands of various Indian legends, to present a sympathetic portrait of many Native American tribes, and especially to disclose their profound relationship with the natural world.</p><p><p>This book is in Electronic Paperback� Format.

Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Dara Horn In this gorgeous still life of a book, Sarah Hall gives us four lives -- two in 1960s Italy and two in contemporary Britain -- each narrated in a different voice. All are artists confronting mortal peril: Susan is a young British photographer mourning her twin brother, Giorgio is an Italian still-life painter facing terminal illness, Peter is a British landscape artist who becomes physically trapped under a boulder he is painting, and Annette is a blind Italian flower girl who once loved to draw and whose beauty makes her a target for assault. Their stories appear unrelated until the connections between them slowly unfold. Susan is Peter's daughter, Peter corresponded with Giorgio, Giorgio was Annette's art teacher, and Annette's connection to Susan becomes clear at the book's end. These links become especially evocative as the reader recognizes many connections the characters cannot see. Peter's disastrous hippie past resonates with the causes of Susan's brother's death. Annette's descent into blindness is a thematic echo of Giorgio's youthful sin, when he failed to see how his acceptance of fascist sponsorship enabled the murderers of his Jewish wife. Susan's grief evokes the book's title, drawn from a classic artist's manual used by both Peter and Giorgio. The effect is to make us wonder about the many moments of insight we miss in our own lives. After hearing from a friend, Giorgio says, "I am not lonely, but receiving such a letter reminds me of the other souls in this world whom I might have liked to meet." The book's great triumph is that we finish it feeling the same way. The downside of the novel's delicate architecture is that it lacks narrative drive. Even when Peter is trapped on a mountainside miles from help, the situation is played for profundity rather than suspense. But Hall has a poet's gift, and this novel is best enjoyed as a prose poem whose blindingly beautiful insights gradually accrue. Her portraits of these artists are captured moments, with each life slowed to a stop by loss and pain. She has made visible to us what we would otherwise be too blind to see in our mortal lives: the ever-present shadow of eternity. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Liao Yiwu (one of the best-known writers in China because he is also one of the most censored) chose his subjects from the bottom of Chinese society: people for whom the &#x201c;new&#x201d; China--the China of economic growth and globalization-&#x2014;is no more beneficial than the old. By asking challenging questions with respect and empathy, he manages to get his subjects to talk openly about their lives.<br><br>Here are a professional mourner, a trafficker in humans, a leper, an abbot, a retired government official, a former landowner, a mortician, a feng shui master, a former Red Guard, a political prisoner, a village teacher, a blind street musician, a Falun Gong practitioner, and many others&#x2013;people who have been battered by life but who have managed to retain their dignity, their humor, and their essential, complex humanity.<br><br>Liao crafted the interviews (conducted between 1990 and 2003) with sensitivity and patience, working both from notes and from his own memory of these remarkable conversations. The result is an idiosyncratic, powerful, and richly revealing portrait of a people, a time, and a place we might otherwise have never known.</p><p>Liao Yiwu is a poet, novelist, and screenwriter. In 1989, he published an epic poem, "Massacre," that condemned the killings in Tiananmen Square and for which he spent four years in prison. His works include <i>Testimonials</i> and <i>Report on China's Victims of Injustice. </i>In 2003, he received a Human Rights Watch Hellman-Hammett Grant, and in 2007, he received a Freedom to Write Award from the Independent Chinese PEN Center. He lives in China.<br><br>Wen Huang is a writer and freelance journalist whose articles and translations have appeared in <i>The Wall Street Journal Asia, </i>the <i>Chicago Tribune, </i>the <i>South China Morning Post, The Christian Science Monitor, </i>and <i>The Paris Review.<br></i><b>Foreword</b><br><br>To hear a new voice is one of the great excitements that a book can offer--and through Liao Yiwu we hear more than two dozen original voices that have a great deal to say. Liao is at once an unflinching observer and recorder, a shoe-leather reporter and an artful storyteller, an oral historian and deft mimic, a folklorist and satirist. Above all, he is a medium for whole muzzled swathes of Chinese society that the Party would like to pretend do not exist: hustlers and drifters, outlaws and street performers, the officially renegade and the physically handicapped, those who deal with human waste and with the wasting of humans, artists and shamans, crooks, even cannibals--and every one of them speaks more honestly than the official chronicles of Chinese life that are put out by the state in the name of "the people."<br><br>Liao was shaped as a writer by the harshest of experiences: he nearly starved to death as a child and his father was branded an enemy of the people; he was thrown in jail for writing poems that spoke truthfully about China's Communist Party and he was beaten in jail for refusing to shut up; and he discovered in jail the enormous value of listening to others like him whom the authorities wanted to keep forever unheard. So Liao writes with the courage of a man who knows loss and doesn't fear it. There is nothing to make him take notice like an official injunction against noticing, nothing to make him listen like official deafness, nothing that drives him to make us see than the blindness that Communist officialdom seeks to impose. But it is not merely defiance, and it is hardly political polemic, that drives the vitality of the stories in this collection. What makes Liao's encounters with his characters so powerful is the fact that he clearly delights in their humanity, however twisted its expression, and he shows his respect for his subjects in the most fundamental way: he lets them speak for themselves.<br><br>There is no question that Liao Yiwu is one of the most original and remarkable Chinese writers of our time. It is, however, truer to say that he is one of the most original and remarkable writers of our time, and that he is from China. Yes, his language is Chinese, his country and its people are his subject, and his stories originate from intensely local encounters. But even to someone who has never been to China, and who can know Liao's work only through Wen Huang's translations, these stories have an immediacy and an intimacy that crosses all boundaries and classifications. They belong to the great common inheritance of world literature.<br><br>Liao Yiwu is an original, but it seems a very good bet that writers as diverse as Mark Twain and Jack London, Nikolai Gogol and George Orwell, Fran�ois Rabelais and Primo Levi would have recognized him at once as a brother in spirit and in letters. He is a ringmaster of the human circus, and his work serves as a powerful reminder--as vital and necessary in open societies lulled by their freedoms as it is in closed societies where telling truthful stories can be a crime--that it is not only in the visible and noisy wielders of power but equally in the marginalized, overlooked, and unheard that the history of our kind is most tellingly inscribed.<br><br><i>Philip Gourevitch</i><br><i>November 2007</i></p><h2>Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds</h2><p>Voted one of <em>Christianity Today's</em> 1998 Books of the Year! For decades, Christians have felt voiceless in the critical debate over evolution. Until now. Finally, ordinary Christians have the opportunity and the resources to defeat the false claims of Darwinism. With all of the complicated scientific debate swirling around the topic of evolution, Christians need an easy way to understand the basic issues without oversimplifying. Phillip Johnson has the answer: the key to defeating the false claims of Darwinism is to open our minds to good thinking habits. Here is first-rate advice on avoiding common mistakes in discussions about evolution, understanding the legacy of the Scopes trial, spotting deceptive arguments, and grasping the basic scientific issues without getting bogged down in unnecessary details. In the bestselling and critically acclaimed Darwin on Trial and Reason in the Balance, Phillip Johnson took on the academic elites and exposed the misleading claims of evolutionary naturalism. <em>Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds</em> provides a new and powerful treatment of these issues for high-school students, parents, teachers, pastors, youth advisors and ordinary readers. Johnson aims not just to defeat a bad theory, but to defeat it in the right way-by opening minds to the truth.</p><p>Phillip E. Johnson taught law for more than thirty years at the University of California--Berkeley where he is professor emeritus. He is recognized as a leading spokesman for the intelligent design movement, and is the author of many books, including <em>Darwin on Trial, Reason in the Balance</em> and <em>Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds.</em>"By profaning the scientific establishment's most sacred cows, U.C.-Berkeley law professor Johnson has earned critical acclaim and brisk sales. Now, the witty iconoclast who questioned the scientific evidence for Darwinian evolution in his Darwin on Trial (1991) provides a short, simple manual to help students, parents, teachers and pastors debate evolution, 'a subject,' Johnson says, 'that has for too long been protected from critical thinking by law and academic custom.' Included in the book are tips for using what Carl Sagan once called a 'baloney detector kit' to verify the evidence used by opponents in an argument, as well as tips for detecting ad hominem and straw man arguments. Johnson's greatest contribution, however, is that he helps non-scientists distinguish between scientific fact, like microevolution within species, and unproved scientific theories, like macroevolution, which claims that molecules became men. He is also adept at exposing philosophical bias behind ostensibly 'objective' scientific arguments. With measured prose and systematic thinking, Johnson uses his legal expertise to demonstrate the ways in which arguments about evolutionary theory may be conducted." (Publishers Weekly)<br><br>"Johnson feels his successful antievolution books, Darwin on Trial (1991) and Reason in the Balance (1995), are more complicated than parents and teachers need to prepare students to take on the evolutionists. Hence, this shorter version of his overall thesis that also advises how to debate evolution. Johnson first makes clear what he perceives the real adversary to be: a dogma that insists life arose solely by chance and that denies contrary evidence a hearing. He then counsels believers to avoid such common mistakes as retreating from theism to deism (and so transforming a continuously creative God into an uninvolved First Cause), to learn to spot faulty analogies and other forms of poor logic, to know the soundest scientific data casting doubt on classical evolution, and to persist--for, he says, the days of Darwinian hegemony are numbered. He firmly believes and seeks to persuade readers that his ultimate causes, aside from religious faith, are freedom of inquiry and the opening of now closed minds."

In my almost empty Brooklyn apartment, my second wife, Chiasa, aimed and then fired sharpened knives into the corked wall. I had taken everything out of this place, but the cork seemed permanent to my project bedroom. It had served as my target practice for seven years and unlike me and my family, it did not want to leave.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go stand over there for me,&#x201d; she said sweetly. As she locked her silver-gray eyes into mine, I looked at her and said nothing. My smile broke out naturally. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t smile at me,&#x201d; she said with a straight face. &#x201c;Every time it&#x2019;s time for us to fight you flash that smile.&#x201d;<br> <br>She must not have figured out that she brought that smile out of me, and so much more. It was because of my love for her that I held onto the keys to this place, where I wouldn&#x2019;t even allow my mother, Umma; my first wife, Akemi; or my sister, Naja to ever again step foot.<br> <br>I walked to the corked wall like she wanted. I leaned back, my hands in my Girbaud jean pockets. She narrowed her eyes and hurled a knife at me. It cut through the still stale air that was typical in the projects and sliced through my fitted. I didn&#x2019;t flinch. She saw that, and inside of seven seconds she outlined my head and shoulders with eight knives rapidly fired by her quick and accurate combination of eyes and fingers.<br> <br>&#x201c;You going to kill me, with my own knives?&#x201d; I asked her. She walked towards me slowly until only noses separated her and me. She pulled each knife down from the cork.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now you do me,&#x201d; she said, handing me the knives. Her breasts pressed against my chest, and her unusually long lashes brushed against mine. The last thing on my mind was taking aim at her with a weapon, and she knew it.<br> <br>Chiasa, my second wife, is a badass, a flawless-skinned, pretty-faced, thick-haired, doe-eyed, ballerina-bodied, ninjutsu-trained warrior. Pretty and precise, she is disciplined to the extreme, same as me. Yet, she is the only one alive who could move me off point, cause me to temporarily lose my balance and have to check myself. The unusual combination of her deep fiery soul, her soft-spoken manner, her sharp mind, her vibrant energy and exquisite body, topped off by the intensity of her loyalty, moved me continuously and I couldn&#x2019;t keep off of her.<br> <br>It had gotten to the point where she sometimes had me questioning things and matters I had never questioned myself about before. Boldly, she had become a Muslim woman at age sixteen. She accepted Islam on her own, without me asking her to do it or having to recite her any truths from the Holy Quran. She reads the Quran for herself, loves each sura she studies and each ayat she learns. She uses every word in the book to challenge herself to become more beautiful in her wisdom and her deeds. For her to love the faith like any Muslim born on Islamic land and raised with the Muslim example and lifestyle surrounding her made her irresistible to me.<br> <br>When anyone in her family tried to reverse Chiasa&#x2019;s mind, she would politely and calmly reveal her angles of thought and her contentment. Once, one of her aunts said in front of her whole family, &#x201c;A Muslim man can only have more than one wife if he can treat them all equally. No man can treat two, three, four women equally, so that means he can really only have one wife. You&#x2019;re supposed to be smart enough to figure it out. It&#x2019;s like a riddle,&#x201d; her aunt said.<br> <br>Chiasa answered softly, correcting her aunt&#x2019;s interpretation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x201c;Treat us each &#x2018;fairly.&#x2019; No woman wants to be treated &#x2018;equal&#x2019; to another, because we are each different. We each enjoy our man in our own way. We each have our own thoughts, likes, dislikes, and hobbies. I don&#x2019;t want my husband to do the exact &#x2018;equal&#x2019; thing he does with his first wife with me; or to give me the exact &#x2018;equal&#x2019; gifts he gave her. Why would I want that? I just want him to love me how I, Chiasa, want to be loved. Us sharing the things that are unique to what we feel when we are together. I want us to enjoy and make each other feel good, because we believe the same things. I want us to learn, earn, and fight together, to be safe, secure, and happy. This is more than enough for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Those words she spoke shut her one aunt up for some time. And, I know she meant it. When we first settled into our new home in Queens, the house that Umma and I purchased with the money that we both earned through our company, Umma Designs, Chiasa chose the smallest bedroom for herself. She set her bedding on the floor, the way she was most comfortable. She lined up her books, mounted her swords, folded her clothes, set up her oils, potions, and creams, brushes, hairpins, and combs, and told me, &#x201c;You are definitely welcome. Come whenever you want to see me. You know I&#x2019;m from a military family. I am an expert at waiting.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her words put me at ease. I was always one hundred that I could protect and provide for and love her. I never wavered on that. But she made me certain that although we have a teenage marriage and she is my second wife, who left behind her parents, her country, and her action-packed life of excitement, she had no regrets and that I made her happy. It felt good that even over time she had zero doubt.<br> <br>Now she was touching my nine-millimeter. I had laid it on the kitchen counter away from both of us, and towards the wall. We were in my Brooklyn &#x2019;hood, my old apartment. So of course I kept it close. Her clear-polished, clipped, and curved nails and pretty fingers on the black steel aroused me. But the way she held it revealed she didn&#x2019;t have no experience with the piece. Chiasa is a bow-and-arrow kind of girl, not to be taken lightly. She could fire something into you, to rock you into a temporary sleep or send you all the way to heaven. Perfect vision, when she fires, she met her mark whether it was your brain, your heart, or your family jewels. And she wasn&#x2019;t above poisoning her arrow tip before positioning it just right in her target&#x2019;s jugular. Her target would be coughing up blood, his own veins exploding then choking him.<br> <br>&#x201c;How come you prefer guns?&#x201d; she asked me, playfully. But I could tell she really wanted to know. She wanted to know and feel everything about me. And her inquiries were always subtle and sweet. The way she went about it would have me so open, I&#x2019;d be telling her something I never shared with no one else. She mixed her curiosity and intellect with her seductions, and it was a powerful potion. I knew what she was really asking me, because I know her and her mind. She was thinking, to a ninjutsu warrior, a gun is a weakness, a type of excuse not to use your hands and mind to the furthest degree, to confront any enemy and solve the problem&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. any problem.<br> <br>&#x201c;The gun is the bottom line,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;The Japanese don&#x2019;t need them.&#x201d; Japan is the country that my second wife is from. She&#x2019;s African and Japanese, an exotic combination. I plucked her from a pretty place, a popular park in Tokyo that was filled with green fields, flowers, and an alluring forest. In that forest there was only one house. Chiasa lived there with only her grandfather, the park ranger.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s peace in your neighborhood and in your country,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;Brooklyn brings the noise. Over here there&#x2019;s certain times and situations where even the swiftest mind and hands move too slow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This block is not so bad looking. I like all the art on the bricks,&#x201d; she said, referring to the &#x2019;hood graffiti. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s kind of cool how they&#x2019;re setting up for that block party outside today. The music is loud but it sounds nice, and the people seem like they could become our friends,&#x201d; she said cheerfully. &#x201c;I bet if you didn&#x2019;t suspect them,&#x201d; she said softly, &#x201c;and trusted in them a little bit more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>I interrupted her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t sleep. These people will easily give a reasonable man a reason to use his trigger finger.&#x201d;<br> <br>I know that men and women were both created by Allah from one same soul. Yet I also know that men and women are different. Chiasa, the woman, is friendly, loving, emotion filled, and hopeful. Besides, she&#x2019;s foreign to my Brooklyn &#x2019;hood, or any &#x2019;hood for that matter. She&#x2019;s a capable female fighter, but she&#x2019;s also innocent and na�ve and likely to underestimate evil. She and I are married, similar in some ways and in deep love. But I am a man born and trained to observe, detect, and perceive all potential threats. To defend, guard, protect or attack, and eliminate all real enemies who don&#x2019;t understand any language other than the ratta-tat-tat or the boom of my &#x201c;milly.&#x201d; I have killed before, for these same reasons. Chiasa has competed in sword fighting and martial arts and won. She has fought, poisoned, injured, and intercepted some enemies in real-life conflict, but she has never killed.<br> <br>Now that she is my wife, she won&#x2019;t have to. I&#x2019;m here for the sole purpose of protecting and providing for and loving my women, and in the future, for raising my sons to do the same for their women and families, Insha&#x2019;Allah.<br> <br>&#x201c;Guns seem messy,&#x201d; she continued her soft expressions while caressing the steel. &#x201c;They make too much noise.&#x201d; She held it now, with both hands. &#x201c;The silent kill is superior,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have a silencer,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t leave it lying around. If you get snagged with it, you do seven extra years&#x2014;separate from gun possession charges.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Seven years,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s too long&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and separate from the other charges&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that&#x2019;s too much.&#x201d; She retreated to silence for some seconds, returning the gun to its position on the counter and pulling back her palms. Then her eyes shifted from the gloom of that thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what I want?&#x201d; she asked, her eyes searching me now to see if I was giving her question real thought, and if I was sharp enough to guess. I was listening carefully now. I wanted to know all of her wants, everything she wanted right now and even in the future. I would be the one who was getting it for her, eliminating her need to need another human beside me, even her father.<br> <br>&#x201c;A crossbow, have you seen one? It&#x2019;s cleverly designed, a quiet, thorough, neater, cleaner weapon, but still super deadly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She sounded like she was describing herself.<br> <br>&#x201c;What would you do with that?&#x201d; I asked her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Run out into the woods,&#x201d; she said. Now she held her pretty arms in position as though she was firing her crossbow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d climb a mountain, track down the bad guys, monsters and witches or avenge anyone who tried to take what I love.&#x201d;<br> <br>She approached me, then pressed her thick, moist and warm lips onto mine.<br> <br>My tongue moving over her tongue, our heads tilted, and there was only our breathing, sucking, and sincerity mixing with our silence. Her black silk yukata dress was easily released. She knew when she put it on this morning, as we trekked and trained over here to Brooklyn, what we came to do. My place in the projects was more of a hut than a palace. It definitely wasn&#x2019;t the nature-filled, beautifully blossoming gardens and forest where she had lived. This was an all cemented place that couldn&#x2019;t compare to the wilderness that she and I had traveled through together, or to eventually climbing over the mountains of Hokkaido, as we fell in love. I knew her soul still craved all of that adventure we had shared, but I also knew that my hut in the projects was where I am right now, and as long as I am anywhere she would willingly and voluntarily choose to be right beside me.<br> <br>Bare backs and bare butts, we were both in the living room now on the warm hard floor, sitting in the spotlight from the powerful sun. Our sauna was natural. The living room windows were shut tight. Chiasa began gently rocking her pretty thighs from side to side, releasing her subtle scent. I watched, wanted to make her wait, while observing her dark brown nipples swelling on her golden breasts. I knew she wouldn&#x2019;t like me staying still and staring because this was her exclusive time with me alone and she cherished it. She started kicking me playfully. Only our feet fought. I cheated, grabbing hold of her right ankle and dragging her. She began laughing but still tried to leap up with her left. Off-balance, she fell. I broke her fall and now our bodies were entangled. I reached back and snatched from off the floor the cloth belt from her yukata.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh no you don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; She raised her voice playfully at what she smartly suspected she had coming. We tussled. I won. Her hands were now tied behind her back. She liked it. I flipped her, then licked her left nipple, then her right. I pulled back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t stop,&#x201d; she whispered. I knew her nipples were super sensitive. I began sucking one nipple and not the other. I moved my hand down her curves and rested it on her waist. &#x201c;Stop playing,&#x201d; she begged. I moved my hand between her thighs and she moaned. I pushed my thickest finger inside and her pussy walls locked around it tightly and thumped rhythmically. When I began kissing her she was breathing hard but still tried to launch a sneak attack and flip me with her feet. I&#x2019;m smiling.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t smile at me!&#x201d; she said, trying to mount me because I hadn&#x2019;t mounted her. We wrestled. My stiff-as-steel joint didn&#x2019;t give a fuck about the game I was playing. In moments I was deep inside of her, pushing and thrashing and the feeling was so extreme.<br> <br>&#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; her lips passionately pushed out causing me to fuck her the way I knew she needed to be fucked in that moment. We were moving, and feeling and changing positions and postures. Warmer than warm, our emotions were heavy like that and only our breathing was heavier.<br> <br>Our mutual deep attraction, our mutual deep admiration, our mutual deep love, loyalty, and deep affection&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. our mutual faith, feelings, and friendship all exploded and I came pouring into her. She was quiet now, still shaking from her own eruption. She turned on her side to face me. So I faced her, watching her slide her slim finger in the sheen of my sweat.<br> <br>&#x201c;One of us should open that window,&#x201d; she said. Her silky Japanese hairstyle turned into a long, wild African bush, me digging it either way because it&#x2019;s all her. Checking her out I eased up, reminding her that &#x201c;We are both naked.&#x201d; She sat up.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; she said sweetly. I kissed her, just pushed my lips against hers. Her now relaxed nipples turned into Kalamata olives. In less than one second we were both swelling again and she leapt at me. Her hips spread in my lap and I touched her up until I was doing sit-ups between her thighs. Chiasa, my second wife, was no longer the unknowing virgin I had first met. She was swinging those hips, completely comfortable with our naked bodies. She craved that friction and would have an outburst when her feeling reached an unbearable high. Her voice echoed in my mostly empty apartment where she and I needed to be alone to get wild and dive all the way into our thing.<br> <br>Her second shaking, and I was sure she wasn&#x2019;t done. Athletic and competitive, she has endurance. Yet in her eyes I saw a complete surrendering to me, from a sixteen-years-young feline fighter unaccustomed to surrendering.<br> <br>&#x201c;How come I love you so muc...</p><h2>Fiction 100: An Anthology of Short Fiction</h2><p><p><b></b> A collection of carefully chosen, interesting stories, the best-selling <i>Fiction 100</i> ignites readers' curiosity, imagination, and intelligence. This outstanding selection of 131 stories is presented in an attractive format, and is available for an excellent price. <b></b> These selections represent a wide variety of subject matter, theme, literary technique, and style. International in scope, it contains fiction from the early 19th century to the present day, and features 131 traditional and contemporary works. <b></b> This collection is suitable for any reader who enjoys short works of fiction with literary merit. </p></p><p>PREFACE <p> With this ninth edition Fiction 100 passes yet another milestone. The eighth edition celebrated the fact that the book had been in print for 25 years, a full quarter of a century, a fact that surprised no one more than it did the editor. With the ninth edition comes yet another realization: Fiction 100 has now been available to college students and their teachers in four decades: the 1970s, the 1980s, the 1990s, and the first decade of the new millennium. With that realization comes still another: that while the world has changed a great deal since 1974, the aims and structure of Fiction 100 on the whole have not. Then as now I have tried to produce a large book of representative-quality short fiction that could be used in a wide variety of course formats and to do so at a reasonable price. </p><p> Another thing that has not changed is the difficulty I have faced in trying to cull the increasingly rich world of short fiction to decide what selections to make. One would think that with a table of contents as large as Fiction 100's such decisions would be relatively easy. They are not. As I long ago discovered, the problem of choice is only multiplied by size. The larger the book, the greater, in fact, the need for principles of selection. </p><p> Those that govern Fiction 100 are easily explained. First of all, I have insisted that the stories included must not only have literary merit but must be interesting. Four decades of teaching the short story to college students has persuaded me that any story, if it is to "work" in the classroom, must engage the curiosity, imagination, and intelligence of students and provide them with a reading experience they find pleasurable. In addition, I have tried to assemble a collection of stories, international in scope, that represents a wide variety of subject matter, theme, literary technique, and style, and that, at the same time, serves to illustrate the development of short fiction&#x2014;its continuity, durability, and tradition&#x2014;from its identifiable beginnings in the early years of the nineteenth century to the present. To the extent possible, I have also asked that the stories "speak to one another" to make possible classroom discussion having to do with comparison and contrast. Roughly a third of the anthology is reserved for older, well-established stories&#x2014;the so-called classics. They are offered without apology; good stories, no matter how often anthologized, are a source of endless pleasure and discovery that no amount of rereading, classroom discussion, or critical analysis can ever exhaust. On the other hand, Fiction 100 tries to present a broad selection of newer and contemporary stories to suggest the direction in which short fiction is moving as one century gives way to the next. </p><p> The book's editorial apparatus remains unchanged. It has been kept to a minimum to make Fiction 100 as usable in as many different kinds of fiction courses as possible. There are, of course, the study questions that follow each story. But these are, by intent, neither complete nor comprehensive. Rather, they are designed to be suggestive, to help guide students in their own literary response, and to serve as a springboard for classroom discussion. In much the same way, the Biographical Notes, Short Story Handbook, and Chronological Table of Contents are intended to provide students with additional resources, tools, and information without getting in the way of their instructor's course format and design. </p><p> The most significant change over the four decades has been the book's contents. Of the 100 stories in the 1974 edition, only 34 remain. While the majority of these represent older, nineteenth-century classics, nearly half belong to the twentieth century, suggesting that our definition of the "classic" short story is an ever-expanding one. The other 95 stories&#x2014;for there are 129 stories in the ninth edition of Fiction 100&#x2014;reflect my own changing relationship with the genre and my response to the many good suggestions from reviewers, colleagues, and students, including my own most recent students in English 2305 at the University of Houston. Many of those students, I hasten to add, have long since become reviewers, colleagues, and friends&#x2014;another legacy of these past four decades, and one that I value deeply. All of you have my thanks. </p><p> Thanks too go to Carrie Brandon, my editor at Prentice Hall, who, among her other virtues, has one that every author and editor deeply appreciates. She is always there when you need her. I need to also thank the enterprising Fred Courtright, who served as permissions editor during this revision cycle, and whose knowledge and expertise in dealing with the always intricate and time-consuming issue of clearing rights and permissions are simply remarkable. Thanks also go to Joe Barron of P. M. Gordon Associates, Inc., who skillfully guided this ninth edition of Fiction 100 through the various stages of the production process. </p><p> If a period crossing four decades&#x2014;the considerable portion of an adult life-time&#x2014;provides anything in the way of perspective and wisdom, it is this: that editing Fiction 100 through nine editions has been an extraordinary opportunity for which I will always be grateful. Each new edition has been a genuine labor of love.</p><p>James H.

This is a book that bridges the gap between the academic, the spiritual and the political. It is the culmination of 20 years of teaching theology and of pastoral ministry, and reflects a continuing engagement with the patristic and medieval tradition of theology as well as with issues of contemporary theology and philosophy.<br> <p>Williams argues that theology moves constantly between the three registers of the celebratory, the communicative and the critical, and is held together by something not captured by any of these modes. He reflects on the fundamental connection between theology and self-awareness and self-critique, and discusses doctrinal issues - creation, incarnation, the Trinity - in this light. He addresses the nature of signs and sacraments and looks at the public and ethical embodiment of this theological vision.<br> </p> <p>Overall, Williams presents a theological perspective acutely aware of the cultural and political crises of our time. He suggests that detachment from doctrinal tradition will not solve our problems and argues instead for an imaginative reworking of the doctrinal tradition, formed in an intense dialogue with modernity and postmodernity.</p><b>Rowan Williams</b> was enthroned as Archbishop of Canterbury in February 2003. His previous positions include Archbishop of Wales, Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity, Oxford and Dean of Clare College, Cambridge. He has taught theology for more than fifteen years in five continents, worked as a parish priest, and published widely. His previous publications include <i>Teresa of Avila</i> (1991), <i>Open to Judgment</i> (1994) and <i>Sergi Bulgakov</i> (1999).</p><h2>Alvin Baltrop: The Piers</h2><p>Powerful, lyrical and controversial, Alvin Baltrop's photographs are a groundbreaking exploration of clandestine gay culture in New York in the 1970s and 80s. During that era, the derelict warehouses beneath Manhattan's West Side piers became a lawless, forgotten part of the city that played host to gay cruising, drug smuggling, prostitution and suicides. <br>Baltrop documented this scene, unflinchingly and obsessively capturing everything from fleeting naked figures in mangled architectural environments to scenes of explicit sex and police raids on the piers. His work is little known and underpublished--mainly due to its unflinching subject matter--but while often explicit, his photographs are on a par with those of Nan Goldin, Peter Hujar and Enrique Metenides. <br>While the outside world saw New York as the glamorous playground of Studio 54, Warhol's gang and the disco era, Baltrop photographed the city's gritty flipside; his work is an important part of both gay culture and the history of New York itself. This clothbound volume compiles the <i>Piers</i> series in one definitive monograph, a powerful tribute to a long-forgotten world at the city's dilapidated margins.<br><b>Alvin Baltrop</b> (1948-2004) was born in the Bronx, New York, and spent most of his life living and working in New York City. From 1969 to 1972, he served in the Vietnam War and began photographing his comrades. Upon his return, he enrolled in the School of the Visual Arts in New York, where he studied from 1973 to 1975. After working various jobs--vendor, jewelry designer, printer--he settled on the banks of Manhattan's West Side, where he would produce the bulk of his photographic output.</p><p>[Alvin Baltrop] captured gay culture on the outskirts in 70s Manhattan and his work is finally receiving the attention it deserves. (Nadja Sayej <i>Guardian</i>)<br><br>The Bronx-born photographer never achieved the success of Mapplethorpe or Hujar, but his images from Manhattan's West Side Piers illuminate a forgotten era. (Miss Rosen <i>Document Journal</i>)<br><br>Baltrop did more than document the world envisioned at the piers; he helped build it.... Black, queer, and unwilling to play the games necessary for success in the art world, Baltrop and his work - explicit but unabashedly romantic depictions of New York's gay and trans underground - never left the margins during his lifetime....Alvin Baltrop's emergence from obscurity should inspire more than nostalgia; rather, it reminds us that resistance - the insistence on the right to life - often remains unseen. (Grace Dunham <i>Village Voice</i>)<br><br>The images, while sometimes loose and grainy, contain unsettling, powerful scenes... (James Reid <i>OUT</i>)</p><h2>Principles of Physical Cosmology</h2><p><p>During the last twenty years, dramatic improvements in methods of observing astrophysical phenomena from the ground and in space have added to our knowledge of what the universe is like now and what it was like in the past, going back to the hot big bang. In this overview of today's physical cosmology, P.J.E. Peebles shows how observation has combined with theoretical elements to establish the subject as a mature science, while he also discusses the most notable recent attempts to understand the origin and structure of the universe. A successor to Peebles's classic volume Physical Cosmology (Princeton, 1971), the book is a comprehensive overview addressed not only to students but also to scientists active in fields outside cosmology.</p><br><p> The first chapter of the work presents the elements of physical cosmology, including the history of the discovery of the expanding universe. The second, on the cosmological tests that measure the geometry of spacetime, discusses general relativity theory as the basis for the tests, and then surveys the broad variety of ways the tests can be applied with the new generations of telescopes and detectors. The third chapter deals with the origin of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe, and reviews ideas about how the evolution of the universe might be traced back to very early epochs when structure originated. Each section of these chapters begins with an introduction that can be understood with no special knowledge beyond undergraduate physics, and then progresses to more specialized topics.</p><br><p> P.J.E. Peebles is Albert Einstein Professor of Science at Princeton University. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Royal Society.</p></p><p>During the last twenty years, dramatic improvements in methods of observing astrophysical phenomena from the ground and in space have added to our knowledge of what the universe is like now and what it was like in the past, going back to the hot big bang."Nothing is more badly needed than a solid but accessible book on cosmology, written by an insider who has not lost his or her skepticism, Peeble's new book fills the bill admirably."

Foulgrin, a high-ranking demon, instructs his subordinate on how to deceive and destroy Jordan Fletcher and his family. It's like placing a bugging device in hell's war room, where we overhear our enemies assessing our weaknesses and strategizing attack. <i>Lord Foulgrin's Letters</i> is a Screwtape Letters for our day, equally fascinating yet destinctly different -- a dramatic story with earthly characters, setting, and plot. A creative, insightful, and biblical depiction of spiritual warfare, this book will guide readers to Christ-honoring counterstrategies for putting on the full armor of God and resisting the devil. Alcorn says to win the battle we must know our God, know ourselves, and know our enemy. <i>Lord Foulgrin's Letters</i>, in unparalleled and compelling fashion, helps us better know each.</p><p>Randy Alcorn is the founder and director of Eternal Perspective Ministries. His books include the bestsellers The Treasure Principle, Deadline, Dominion, Lord Foulgrin&#39;s Letters, and The Ishbane Conspiracy. He has written seven other nonfiction books. Randy and his wife, Nanci, live in Gresham, Oregon, and have two grown daughters, Karina and Angela.Hard on the heels of Don Hawkins's flambeau@darkcorp.com (LJ 2/1/00), where a demon offers advice to his subordinate via e-mail, Alcorn's repetitious and wordy new work (after Dominion and Deadline) offers homage to C.S. Lewis's The Screwtape Letters. As Foulgrin writes missives to his lackey Squaltaint, he comments on Jordan Fletcher, a businessman so busy looking for happiness that it's passing him by. Fletcher's story unfolds in tiny vignettes between letters as Squaltaint tries to follow his superior's order to corrupt Fletcher so that he will never have a chance at Heaven. While Foulgrin's signatory phrases are somewhat amusing ("The Devil's advocate," "Populating hell one image-bearer at a time," etc.), the basic message behind this book is beaten into the dust. Purchase where Alcorn fans demand, but for satire, flambeau@darkcorp.com cuts to the basics.&nbsp;Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.&nbsp;<i>--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.</i></p><h2>Standing Firm: Finding Courage in the Word of God</h2><p><p>Many of us are passive in our daily stance against the enemy, leaving us vulnerable and unprepared when times of struggle hit.

His <i>Catiline&#x2019;s War</i> tells of the conspiracy in 63 bc led by L.

Sallust&#x2019;s vivid account of Roman public life shows a Republic in decline, prey to moral corruption and internal strife. In <i>The Jugurthine War</i> he describes Rome&#x2019;s fight in Africa against the king of the Numidians from 111 to 105 bc, and provides a damning picture of the Roman aristocracy.

They published sixteen books together.Cinnabar, the One O&#x2019;Clock Fox <br><br> Chapter 1<p></p> FOUR IS A JOLLY NICE NUMBER<p></p> <br>It was April in Virginia. The brooks and runs on George Washington&#x2019;s estate were overflowing in their hurry to join the big Potomac. Pussy willows along the banks were swollen to plumpness. And everywhere, the woods and meadows were alive with cheeps and chirrings and little feet scampering.<br> <br>One morning just before the break of dawn, when the moon was still shining brightly, four little fox cubs were born in a den tucked away in a sassafras thicket.<br> <br>Cinnabar, their father, had been out all night, hunting. He wanted to bring a nice plump hen to his wife, because she liked nice plump hens. And if ever there was a time to please Vicky, as he called her, it was now. This very night.<br> <br>Cinnabar&#x2019;s masklike face, with its slanted amber eyes, looked up at the great white face of the moon. But that is not what he saw. He saw instead the warm coziness of his own den. And there was Vicky, still busy at the nestbox weaving a mattress of grasses and reeds. He knew what that meant. It meant furry little foxes&#x2014;any moment now.<br> <br><br> <br>He bayed his happiness to the moon: &#x201c;Yapp yurr. Yapp yur-rrr.&#x201d; He disappeared into a tangle of honeysuckle and hauled out the fat hen that he had cached away an hour before. Then he pawed deeper into the tanglewood and gathered up four good-sized barn mice. He took them one at a time and placed them side by side neatly and securely underneath the hen&#x2019;s wings.<br> <br>&#x201c;My stars and garters!&#x201d; he barked to himself. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a capital night for hunting!&#x201d; Grabbing the hen&#x2019;s neck in his mouth, he flung her over his shoulder and trotted off toward home.<br> <br>Cinnabar was a big, red, magnificent fellow. Courage and heart showed in the very look of him. A rough scar across his nose and a nick on one ear in no way marred his handsomeness. On the contrary, they gave him a gay and gallant air. They spoke of battles won&#x2014;over eagles and buzzards and hawks and weasels.<br> <br>Cinnabar was, in truth, afraid of nothing. Neither of dark nor of storm; nor of hunters nor hounds. He was free and unfearing, the very spirit of the wilds.<br> <br>With a windblown movement he went gliding along, his brush of a tail stretched out full. His lively ears pricked to and fro, catching every sound of the night. Pine needles singing. Frogs playing their bassoons. Birds beginning to stir and twitter. It seemed to him that the morning was coming in with a peculiar gladness.<br> <br><br> <br>Silently he left the big trees behind and trotted down a little avenue of hemlocks. Fast as he traveled, his imagination went faster still. He could almost hear Vicky&#x2019;s cry of delight when she spied not only the plump hen, but the four good mice as well. &#x201c;How she likes hens and mice!&#x201d; he mused. &#x201c;Better than grouse and grasshoppers. Better than anything&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. except me!&#x201d; he chuckled, as he shifted his burden to the other shoulder.<br> <br>Chatting and laughing and happy in himself, he threaded his way through the sassafras thicket that hid his den. But as he approached the opening, he stopped dead. What were those strange sounds? He thought he heard small trills and whimperings.<br> <br>&#x201c;Criminy, criminy, and by Jimminy!&#x201d; he exploded. &#x201c;I must be a father. I hear puppy voices. Unmistakably, I do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Parting the ferns that screened the doorway, he pattered softly through them. Then wriggling forward on his belly, he bunted the hen down the dark entry and finally emerged into the warm comfort of his own den. He blinked his eyes at the brightness. A wick burning in an oyster shell gave off a yellow light, and the fire in the grate was a red glow.<br> <br>&#x201c;That you, Cinny?&#x201d; a voice came muffled.<br> <br><br> <br>In reply, Cinnabar barked two short barks and one long. It was the family signal, and it meant &#x201c;Good hunting tonight.&#x201d; He saw Vicky now&#x2014;up on one elbow, half sitting, half reclining in the nestbox&#x2014;and he could hear her tongue strokes, licking, licking, licking.<br> <br>Little shivers of excitement raced up and down his spine. How many pups would there be this time? Two? Four? Nine? Twelve?<br> <br>&#x201c;I shall be quite content with three,&#x201d; he told himself as he took a step closer, &#x201c;and I hope they all have blue eyes. Blue eyes bewitch me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Vicky was eager to tell about her babies. She gave four quick, happy barks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh! Four is a jolly nice number,&#x201d; Cinnabar assured her. &#x201c; &#x2019;Twill be easy to provide for them.&#x201d; He laid the big white hen in a splash of firelight, hoping Vicky would notice. But she was concerned only with her young ones.<br> <br>&#x201c;My dear,&#x201d; said Cinnabar with a proud grin, &#x201c;have you thought of names for the funny snub-nosed things?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cinnabar! They are not funny snub-nosed things. Oh, yes, they are,&#x201d; she laughed, contradicting herself all in the same breath. &#x201c;Well, anyway, I&#x2019;ve named the two little boys.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So?&#x201d; asked Cinnabar, shoving the hen closer.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. And I do hope you like family names.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;F&#x2019;rinstance?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Rascal for my brother, and Pascal for my father.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I like them indeed!&#x201d; Cinnabar nodded in approval as he plucked at his whiskers thoughtfully. Then reaching into the nestbox he fondled the fuzzy little creatures. &#x201c;Hmmm&#x2014;how about Merry and Mischief for the vixens?&#x201d; he asked, looking all merry and mischievous himself.</p><h2>Reincarnation: The Missing Link In Christianity</h2><p>A provocative work that makes the case that Jesus taught reincarnation.

Every detail of the tabernacle points to some aspect of the person and work of our Savior. Then the tabernacle becomes, secondarily, a picture of the believer. Thirdly, it provides a complete picture of the plan of salvation. It is an inexhaustible subject.

Scientifically, it has become more clear now, but even without scientific investigation the mystics have been saying exactly the same thing for thousands of years--that all these things your mind is filled with are not yours; you are beyond them. You get identified with them, and that's the only problem.<br><br>For example, somebody insults you and you become angry. You think you are becoming angry, but scientifically speaking the other person's insult is only functioning as a remote control. The person who has insulted you is managing your behavior. Your anger is in his hands; you are behaving like a puppet.<br><br>Now scientists are able to put electrodes in the brain at certain centers, and it is almost unbelievable. The mystics have been talking about it for thousands of years, but only recently has science discovered that there are hundreds of centers in the brain controlling all your behavior. An electrode can be put at a particular center--for example, the center for anger. Nobody insults you, nobody humiliates you, nobody says anything to you; you are sitting silently, happily, and somebody pushes a button on a remote control and you become angry! It is a very strange feeling because you cannot see the reason anywhere, why you are becoming angry. Perhaps you will rationalize it somehow. You see a man passing by in the hallway and you remember that he insulted you--you will find some rationalization just to console yourself that you are not going mad. Sitting silently . . . and suddenly feeling so angry without any provocation?<br><br>And the same remote controller can work to make you happy. Sitting in your chair you start giggling, and you look all around--if somebody is watching you he will think you are going crazy! Nobody has said anything, nothing has happened, nobody has slipped on a banana peel, so why are you giggling? You will rationalize it, you will try to find some rational grounds for giggling. And the strangest thing is that the next time the same button is pushed and you giggle, you will again come up with the same rationale, the same consolation, the same explanation--not even the rationalization is yours! It is almost like a gramophone record.<br><br>When I was reading about the scientific investigations into these centers, I was reminded of my student days. I was a competitor in an inter-university debate; all the universities of the country were participating. The Sanskrit University of Varanasi was also participating, but naturally the students from Sanskrit University were feeling a little inferior compared with competitors from other universities. They knew ancient scriptures, they knew Sanskrit poetry, drama, but they were not familiar with the contemporary world of art, literature, philosophy, or logic. And the inferiority complex works in very strange ways. . . .<br><br>After I had spoken, the next person was the representative from Sanskrit University. And just to impress the audience and to hide his inferiority complex, he started his speech with a quotation from Bertrand Russell--he had memorized it, and Sanskrit students are more capable of memorizing things than anybody else. But his stage fright was such . . . he knew nothing about Bertrand Russell, he knew nothing about what he was quoting. It would have been better to have quoted something from Sanskrit, because he would have been more at ease.<br><br>In the middle he stopped--just in the middle of a sentence. And I was sitting by his side, because I had just finished. There was silence, and he was perspiring, and just to help him, I said, "Start again"--because what else to do? He was simply stuck. I said, "If you cannot go ahead, start again; perhaps it may come back to you."<br><br>So he started again: "Brothers and sisters . . ." and at exactly the same point he got stuck again. Now it became a joke. The whole hall was shouting, "Again!" and he was in such a difficult situation. Neither could he go ahead nor could he keep standing there silent; it would look too idiotic. So he had to start again. But he would start at the very beginning, "Brothers and sisters . . ."<br><br>For the whole fifteen minutes we heard only that portion--beginning with "Brothers and sisters . . ." and going up to the point where he got stuck, again and again. When his time was finished he came and sat next to me. He said, "You destroyed my whole thing!"<br><br>I said, "I was trying to help you."<br><br>He said, "This is help?"<br><br>I said, "You were going to be in difficulty anyway. This way at least everybody enjoyed it--except you, that I can understand. But you should rejoice that you made so many people happy! And why did you choose that quotation? When I was saying to you, 'Start again' there was no need to start over from the very beginning--you could have dropped that quotation, there was no need."<br><br>But I came to know through reading the scientific research that the speech center is exactly like a gramophone record, but with one thing very strange and special. The moment the needle is taken away from the record you can put the needle back at the spot where you took it from, and go on from there. But in the speech center, when the needle is taken away and put back again, the center instantly goes back to the very beginning.<br><br>If this happens, can you say you are the master of what you are saying? Are you the master of what you are feeling? Certainly there are no electrodes implanted in you, but biologically exactly the same work is going on.<br><br>You see a certain type of woman, and immediately your mind reacts: "How beautiful!" This is nothing but the remote control. That woman functioned like a remote control attached to an electrode, and your speech center simply went into its recorded speech: "How beautiful!"<br><br>The mind is a mechanism. It is not you. It records things from outside, and then reacts to outside situations according to those recordings. That's the only difference between a Hindu and a Mohammedan and a Christian and a Jew--they just have different gramophone records. But inside, it is one humanity. When you play a gramophone record . . . it may be in Hebrew, it may be in Sanskrit, it may be in Persian, it may be in Arabic, but it is the same machine that plays the record. To the machine it does not matter whether it plays Hebrew or Sanskrit.<br><br>All your religions, all your political ideas, all your cultural attitudes are nothing but recordings. And in certain situations, certain recordings are provoked.<br><br>There is a beautiful incident in the life of one of the wisest kings of India, Raja Dhoj. He was very much interested in wise people. His whole treasury was open only for one purpose--to gather together all the wise people of the country, whatever the cost. His capital was Ujjain, and he had thirty of the country's most famous people in his court. It was the most precious court in the whole country.<br><br>One of the greatest poets of the world, Kalidas, was one of the members of the court of Raja Dhoj. One day a man appeared at the court saying that he spoke thirty languages with the same fluency, the same accuracy and accent as any native person could, and he had come to make a challenge: "Hearing that you have in your court the wisest people of the country, here are one thousand gold pieces. Anybody who can recognize my mother tongue, these one thousand gold pieces are his. And if he cannot recognize it, then he will have to give me one thousand gold pieces."<br><br>There were great scholars there--and everybody knows that whatever you do, you can never speak any language the way you can speak your own mother tongue, because every other language has to be learned by effort. Only the mother tongue is spontaneous--you don't even learn it, really. It is a result of your whole situation that you simply start speaking it. It has a spontaneity. That's why even the Germans, who call their country "fatherland"--most countries call their land "the motherland"--but even the Germans don't call their language the "father tongue." Every language is called a mother tongue because the child starts learning from the mother. And anyway the father never has the chance to speak in the house! It is always the mother who is speaking; the father is listening.<br><br>Many in the court of Raja Dhoj took the challenge. The man spoke in thirty languages--a few pieces in one language, a few pieces in another language--and it was really hard! He was certainly a master artist. He was speaking each language the way only a native can speak his own mother tongue. All of the thirty great scholars lost the contest. The contest continued for thirty days, and every day one person took the challenge and lost it. They would guess, and the man would say, "No, this is not my mother tongue."<br><br>On the thirty-first day . . . King Dhoj had been continually saying to Kalidas, "Why don't you take up the challenge? Because a poet knows language in a more delicate way, with all its nuances, more than anybody else." But Kalidas remained silent. He had been watching for thirty days, trying to determine which language the man spoke with more ease, with more spontaneity, with more joy. But he had not been able to find any difference, the man spoke all the languages in exactly the same way.<br><br>On the thirty-first day, Kalidas asked King Dhoj and all the wise people to stand outside in front of the hall. There was a long row of steps, and the man was coming up; as he came up to the last step, Kalidas pushed him down. And as he fell rolling down the steps, anger came up--he shouted.<br><br>Kalidas said, "This is your mother tongue!" Because in anger you cannot remember, and the man had not been expecting this tactic to be used in the contest. And that actually was his mother tongue. Deepest in his mind, the recording was of the mother tongue.<br><br>One of my professors used to say--he had lived all over the world, teaching in different universities--"Only in two situations in life have I been in difficulty in other countries, and those are when I was fighting or falling in love. In those times, one needs one's mother tongue. However beautifully you express your love in another language, it is not the same, it seems superficial. And when you are angry and fighting in somebody else's language, you cannot have that same joy . . ." He said, "Those are two very significant situations--fighting and loving--and mostly they are together with the same person! With a person you are in love, and with that same person you have to fight."<br><br>And he was right to say that everything in a language that you have learned remains superficial--you can neither sing a beautiful song nor can you use the real four-letter words of your own language. In both cases, it remains lukewarm.<br><br>The mind certainly is a mechanism for recording experiences from the outside, and reacting and responding accordingly. It is not you. But unfortunately the psychologists think the mind is all, and beyond mind there is nothing. That means you are nothing but a collection of impressions from the outside; you don't have any soul of your own. Even the very idea of the soul is given by the outside.<br><br>This is where the mystics differ. They will agree absolutely with the contemporary scientific research about the mind. But it is not right about the human being's totality. Beyond the mind, there is an awareness that is not given by the outside, and is not just an idea--and there is no experiment up to now that has found any center in the brain that corresponds to awareness.<br><br>The whole work of meditation is to make you aware of all that is mind, and disidentify yourself from it. When the mind is angry, you can realize that it is simply a gramophone record. When the mind is sad, you can simply remember that it is only a gramophone record. A certain situation is pressing the remote control and you feel sad, you feel angry, you feel frustrated, you feel worried, you feel tense--all these things are coming from the outside and the mind is responding to them. But you are the watcher, you are not the actor. It is not your reaction.<br><br>Hence the whole art of meditation is to learn awareness, alertness, consciousness. While you are feeling angry, don't repress it; let it be there. Just become aware. See it as if it is some object outside you. Slowly go on cutting your identifications with the mind. Then you have found your real individuality, your being, your soul.<br><br>Finding this awareness is enlightenment--you have become luminous. You are no longer in darkness, and you are no longer just a puppet in the hands of the mind. You are a master, not a servant. Now the mind cannot react automatically, autonomously, the way it used to do before. It needs your permission. If somebody insults you and you don't want to be angry, then you don't become angry.<br><br>Gautam Buddha used to say to his disciples, "To be angry is so stupid that it is inconceivable that intelligent human beings go on doing it. Somebody else is doing something and you are getting angry? He may be doing something wrong, he may be saying something wrong, he may be making some effort to humiliate you, to insult you--but that is his freedom. If you react, you are a slave. If you say to the person, 'It is your joy to insult me, it is my joy not to be angry,' you are behaving like a master."<br><br>Unless this master becomes crystal clear in you, crystallized, you don't have any soul. You are just a phonograph record, and as you grow older your recording goes on expanding. You become more knowledgeable, and people think you are becoming wiser--you are simply becoming a donkey loaded with books.<br><br>Wisdom consists only of one thing--not of knowing many things but of knowing only one thing, and that is your awareness and its separation from the mind.<br><br>Just try watching in small things, and you will be surprised. People go on doing the same things every day. They go on deciding to do something, and they go on repenting because they have not done it; it becomes a routine.</p><h2>Handwoven Home: Weaving Techniques, Tips, and Projects for the Rigid-Heddle Loom</h2><p><b>There's No Place Like a Handwoven Home!</b><br><br> Hand towels, table runners, placemats, throws--weaving is perfectly suited to creating and customizing just about any textile for your home.<br><br> In <i>Handwoven Home</i>, weaving expert Liz Gipson explains the tools and techniques you'll need to weave personalized home textiles on a rigid-heddle loom--the most popular loom on the market today.

However, for most of my life I&#x2019;ve been told that I&#x2019;m odd. Admittedly, trekking through jungles, studying the plant knowledge of indigenous Indian shamans and South American herbal healers, getting harassed in airport customs with a suitcase full of strange-looking murky liquids, bark, leaves, and roots, and running a large corporation in the process, is pretty unusual. However, it never really was a goal of mine to just be &#x201c;usual.&#x201d;<br><br>Most people who first meet me often ask: &#x201c;How did you ever get into a profession like this?&#x201d; Looking back, a series of journeys seems to have redirected the course of my life and shaped it into what it is today. I have to go back about twenty years to my most memorable journey, which started me onto this odd path where I find myself today.<br><br>I first became interested in herbal medicine and alternative health when, in my mid-twenties, I was diagnosed with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Conventional medicine gave up on me after two years of traditional chemotherapy and cancer treatments and sent me home to die. I was twenty-four years old and was told I wouldn&#x2019;t see my twenty-fifth birthday. But being the odd, determined, stubborn, rebellious individual that most people described me as even back then, I didn&#x2019;t give up.<br><br>Twenty years ago it was even harder than it is now to access accurate information on herbs and alternative therapies. But you might say that I had a &#x201c;dying need to know,&#x201d; and I began studying alternative health with a vengeance. With a combination of herbal medicine, diet, nutrition, and other natural healing modalities, I was diagnosed as cancer-free eighteen months later. Not only was my cancer gone, but the extensive damage that was done to my body and internal organs from the conventional cancer treatments was healed or on the mend. Another real oddity, I was told. My oncologist, who scoffed at anything herbal or unconventional, believes that I was simply too stubborn to die. I know there is some truth in that statement, but I also believe that herbal medicine went a long way in curing my cancer and healing my body.<br><br>What I didn&#x2019;t understand then (or now, really) is why they call chemotherapy and today&#x2019;s modern medicine &#x201c;conventional medicine&#x201d; and refer to herbal medicine as &#x201c;alternative.&#x201d; My personal journey showed me that herbal medicine was much more conventional. It dates back literally centuries in time, with the less-than-100-year-old pharmaceutical industry offering the &#x201c;alternatives&#x201d; to the plant medicines we&#x2019;ve used since before human beings even learned how to chronicle their uses. At least for me, herbal medicine was much more effective than the &#x201c;alternatives&#x201d; conventional medicine offered me in my personal battle with cancer.<br><br>After winning this battle, I continued on in my business career in Texas, starting companies in several different industries and selling them when I became bored with their day-to-day management. In business I was considered &#x201c;successful,&#x201d; and that success resulted in a ballistic, workaholic lifestyle. I continued studying herbal medicine and alternative health as a hobby, choosing to use herbs and natural health rather than drugs for my and my family&#x2019;s health. They thought I was pretty odd too, but they accepted the strange herbal potions and nutritional remedies I gave them when they were sick.<br><br>Then, in 1989, I took a much-needed vacation that changed the course of my life yet again. Maybe it was just the first time I had taken a breath or a break in many years, but a journey to the wilds of Africa somehow reconnected me to the land, nature, and wildlife. It showed me that I needed to make a change in the hectic, harried life I had created, which was involved in the ego of success and the power of money and which wasn&#x2019;t really personally fulfilling. So, when I returned from Africa, I sold my companies, bought a ranch in the hill country of Texas, and &#x201c;retired.&#x201d;<br><br>There&#x2015;in a conventional, sort of backwards, rural Texas community north of Austin&#x2015;I quickly became &#x201c;the odd woman at Clear Creek Ranch&#x201d; to the local farmers and ranchers. I grew weird plants, herbs, and vegetables, raised a motley menagerie of teenage boys and exotic animals (which hardly ever acted like they were supposed to), had too much land that was &#x201c;unproductive,&#x201d; and was obviously in dire need of a husband to make her do things right. Leastwise, that&#x2019;s what the local farmers and ranchers would tell you. That didn&#x2019;t keep them from dropping by to tell me about their aches and pains to see what kind of odd concoction of plants I might pick out of the gardens and give them, and which somehow mysteriously worked. Often, they&#x2019;d just drop by to see what odd thing I was up to that day.<br><br>Wanting to give something back (and a bit bored with farm life), I started a small consulting company there on the ranch. The company (me) researched and collected information on cancer and AIDS therapies that were being used in other places in the world and taught cancer patients how they could access them. My personal mission was to compile all the research on alternative therapies and to make the information available to those faced with the same struggle that I had once confronted. It had been a great source of frustration and a committed struggle for me to try to access this type of information when I had cancer, especially at a time when I had little enough energy to just get through a day.<br><br>It was during this research that I came across an herbal extract that was sold as an herbal drug in Europe for cancer and AIDS patients, with some interesting results. When I determined that it was a simple extract of a natural plant that could be sold here as an herbal supplement (for a lot less money than the European company was charging), I decided to go to the source where the plant grew. My mission then was to try to import the plant into the United States. The plant was called cat&#x2019;s claw (Uncaria tomentosa), and the source was the Amazon rainforest in Peru. This new journey into the Amazon rainforest changed the course of my life yet again.<br><br>On that first journey into the rainforest, I fell in love. I fell in love with the jungle, the people, the culture, the lifestyle and attitude, the plants and trees, the incredible rivers . . . all of which make up the Amazon rainforest. I also saw, on that first trip, the incredible amount of destruction that was happening in the Amazon. I saw that it was possible that the whole thing could go up in smoke and be wiped off the face of the Earth, conceivably in my lifetime. Waiting for my flight home in the Lima airport in Peru, I sat there sunburned, bug-bit, tired, and excited and decided that not only did I want to start a new company in the States to begin importing this wonderful plant called cat&#x2019;s claw but that I also had to try to make a difference to help stop the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. I didn&#x2019;t quite know how then, but I knew that an odd, determined, stubborn, rebellious sort of person such as myself had as good a chance as anyone else did.<br><br>That was the beginning of a group of companies that I founded in my thoughts sitting in the Lima airport, and officially two days later in Austin, Texas. I came out of &#x201c;retirement&#x201d; and began importing cat&#x2019;s claw into the United States shortly thereafter. Through my ongoing work with the company and the many subsequent trips to the Amazon, I learned more and more about the other medicinal plants that were used as natural medicines by the indigenous peoples in the rainforest and began importing those as well. My company quickly outgrew Clear Creek Ranch and it was time to sell it and move back into the city as the journey, which now seemed to have a life of its own, continued forward.<br><br>In my work with the Raintree group of companies which I founded in 1995, I have been setting up plant harvesting programs with Indian tribes and rural Amazon communities, that are today, sustainably harvesting more than sixty medicinal plants from Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, and Colombia. My ongoing research on medicinal plants continues to take me into the heart of the rainforest, where I work side by side with indigenous tribal shamans and medicine men, rural village herbalists and local &#x201c;doctors&#x201d; called curanderos, as well as North and South American herbalists, plant chemists, and universities.<br><br>Traveling through the remote areas of the Amazon where medicines, hospitals, and doctors are virtually non-existent has brought an opportunity to learn as a practitioner how to treat illnesses and diseases that I would never encounter in the United States . . . malaria, diphtheria, yellow fever, typhoid, and leprosy, just to name a few (not to mention the incredible bacterial, parasitic and fungal infections I&#x2019;ve seen!). As a practitioner or healer in the jungle, I am called &#x201c;jaguar-woman,&#x201d; white witch, shaman, an Indian phrase that translates to &#x201c;big mother in charge,&#x201d; or curandera (healer) by the remote villages and Indians I visit and work with. I use their ancient knowledge of their plants and combine it with western research and science, so my &#x201c;potions&#x201d; are different, yet familiar, to their shamans and healers. Again, they think I&#x2019;m pretty odd too, but many have never seen a very tall blonde woman with blue eyes and freckles (which many shamans have tried to cure me of!). As a board certified naturopath here in the States, I enjoy working on the many hard cases that get referred to me&#x2015;people who have exhausted all other therapies and are willing to try some unusual jungle remedy for their cure. It seems my life has come full circle in the last twenty years, and I now find myself helping many cancer patients in my practice, when it was once me that was faced with this deadly disease so many years ago.<br><br>Oddly enough, of all the businesses I have founded and managed in my career, this is the only one that I&#x2019;ve never had to determinedly push, market, make work, or direct. Since they were created, I have literally been running behind them trying to keep up. They seem to have a life, path, and purpose of their own; and I have never worked so hard, had so much fun and adventure, and been as personally fulfilled as I am today. It has certainly been a grand adventure. However odd it is, I feel I am truly blessed to be on the path I find myself on today.<br><br>My journey has just recently been redirected yet again: this year, I&#x2019;ve moved myself and company&#x2015;lock, stock, and barrel&#x2015;to Carson City, Nevada. It seems that it was time for me to focus on helping some North American Indian tribes, much in the same manner that I&#x2019;ve been assisting the South American Indians over the years. If this new venture/adventure is successful, my next book may well be on North American Indian medicinal plants and the need to put our own Native Americans back onto their ancestral lands (now owned and controlled by our government&#x2019;s forestry agencies) as caretakers of the land in sustainable plant harvesting programs. What an adventurous journey that will be! Believe it or not, I haven&#x2019;t been bored&#x2015;not once&#x2015;in the last nine years; that doesn&#x2019;t look like it will be changing any time soon, either!<br><br>Before I became known as &#x201c;the white witch of the Amazon,&#x201d; I was (and am) a businesswoman first and foremost. When I first arrived in the Amazon, I approached the rainforest and rainforest conservation in a business-like manner and began to look for business solutions to rainforest destruction. This was odd to the activists and conservationists I came across, but again, I was used to being called odd. I believed then and now that, wherever you are in the world, basic business strategies still apply. Greed is greed and profits are profits, even in the remote jungles. If you want someone to do something, make it profitable for them to do and it&#x2019;s not so hard to convince them. So I set about showing people in the rainforest how they could make more money sustainably harvesting medicinal plants like cat&#x2019;s claw than they could make at timber harvesting, grazing livestock, agriculture, or subsistence cropping&#x2015;practices that destroy the forest. It sounds almost too simple, but it&#x2019;s effective and it works.<br><br>The only component left to make this business strategy work is to create the market demand for these sustainable forest resources so that it can result in profits for those participating. That&#x2019;s not as hard as it sounds either. The alternative health and natural/herbal products industry in the United States is growing at an unprecedented rate. Recent statistics show that consumers have spent more out-of-pocket funds on alternative health and alternative health products and supplements than they have for conventional medicine over the past few years. And the rainforest does provide a wealth of beneficial natural products and highly effective medicinal plants for that industry.<br><br>This book represents almost ten years of my personal research and documentation on these important medicinal plants in the Amazon rainforest during my journeys into the South American jungles and in my journey with Raintree. I firmly believe that medicinal plants, such as those discussed in this book, are the true wealth of the rainforest and the means by which it can be saved from destruction. They have for centuries positively affected the health and well-being of the inhabitants of the forest. Through their sustainable harvesting, they can and will positively affect the health, well-being, and continuance of the rainforest itself.<br><br>It is my sincere hope that you, the reader of this book, will learn an appreciation of the rainforest and why it is so important to be saved; learn more about the wealth of beneficial medicinal plants it provides us; and learn how you can take part in positively affecting your health and the health of the rainforest with these wonderful plants.<br><br>May your own journeys and adventures be prosperous!<br><br>Yours in health,<br><br>Leslie Taylor, ND</p></p><h2>The Kingstone Bible Vol. III</h2><p>The Kingstone Bible is the most complete graphic adaptation of the Bible ever published.

Other transforming industries have caught investors' imaginations -- the radio, automobile, airline, and biotech industries. All sparked investors' dreams of immediate wealth, which in turn caused a massive run-up in share prices as the investing public went wild pumping money into them. This of course created higher share prices, which vindicated the investors' decisions and serves as an enticement to invest even more. Many people see others getting rich and they too join the game, which sends stock prices soaring even higher. This process often continues until economic reality is left far behind. But it can't go on forever, for economic reality is like gravity. At some point the bubble bursts and stock prices fall.</p><p>From 1919 to 1939 alone, more than three hundred airline manufacturers came and went. Fewer than ten survive today. And what about their brethren the airlines? In the past twenty years, 129 carriers have filed for bankruptcy. In fact, until 1992, the total amount lost by airlines that went bankrupt was far greater than the total they made. The Internet carnage is equally sobering -- hundreds of these companies, some that once commanded $100 or more a share, have become nothing but bitter memories in the minds of their shareholders.</p><p>For Warren, the problem with transforming industries is that they seldom, if ever, establish any kind of durable competitive advantage due to the intense competition that exists in the infancy of any industry. Intense competition equates of course to lower profits, which ultimately kills a soaring stock price. Also, in new industry sectors, businesses evolve through countless permutations before establishing any kind of durable competitive advantage. That new businesses by definition have no history of product durability -- one of the cornerstones of Warren's selective contrarian investment philosophy -- is another strike against them.</p><p>Lack of durability keeps Warren from investing in these emerging industries on principle, but he nevertheless likes to hypothetically consider purchasing such businesses whole. He believes that if the entire company isn't worth purchasing at the current stock market price, he shouldn't even buy one share. It is a unique way to look at a prospective investment and one that is shunned by most of Wall Street.</p><p>To understand Warren's whole business approach you need to know how to calculate what is called the company's stock market capitalization or, as it is commonly known, the company's market cap.</p><p>The market cap is computed by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the current market price of one share of the company's stock. Let's say that Company X has 100 million shares outstanding and is trading at $50 a share. The market cap for Company X would be $5 billion (100 million shares x $50 a share = $5 billion). If the price of Company X's stock dropped the next day to, say, $45 a share, its market cap would drop to $4.5 billion (100 million shares x $45 a share = $4.5 billion). Conversely the market cap would increase if Company X's stock price went up.</p><p>When Warren considers whether to make an investment in Company X, he asks himself the following questions: If the company in question had a market cap of $5 billion and I had $5 billion sitting in my bank account, would I use it to buy the whole company? What kind of return would I get if I paid $5 billion for the company? If he finds the rate of return attractive, he will invest in the company. Notice that he is not asking whether the stock price of the company will go up. Rather, he asks how much will he likely earn given the price that he pays for the entire business.</p><p>Let's run through an example. Suppose you were thinking about investing in Yahoo! back on March 10, 2000. Its trading price at that time was $178 a share, and it had a market cap of approximately $97 billion. The question would have been this: If you had $97 billion, would you have been willing to spend it to buy the entire company?</p><p>Before you spent you $97 billion, you might just have looked over your other investment options before forking over all that cash for a big ride on Yahoo!. The first thing you discover is that you can invest your $97 billion in U.S. treasury bonds and get a 7% return, which means that you would be earning approximately $6.7 billion a year in interest. Not bad. Compare this to the $70.8 million that Yahoo! was expected to earn in 2000 and the treasury bonds look far more enticing and enriching.</p><p>But say that you are a true believer in the Internet and think Yahoo! has a great future! Warren would argue that this may be true, but if you buy all of Yahoo!, you are going to be giving up $6.7 billion in yearly interest income in exchange for the $70.8 million a year that Yahoo! is earning. You, in turn, argue that Yahoo! will earn great sums in the future. Warren would argue that this may also be true. But for each future year you give up the $6.7 billion in interest income, that's $6.7 billion more that Yahoo! is going to have to earn just to keep you even. After even a few years, a billion here and a billion there start to add up. (To keep this in perspective, in 2000, Coca-Cola earned approximately $2.1 billion and General Motors earned approximately $4.4 billion. It takes a hell of a business to generate $6.7 billion in earnings.) It doesn't take a genius to see that buying all of Yahoo! might not be the smartest thing to do with your $97 billion. InWarren's mind it's a short step from there to the conclusion that buying a single share is also a bad idea.</p><p>Compare our prospective investment in Yahoo! with an investment in insurance giant and Buffett favorite Allstate. On March 10, 2000, during an insurance recession, Warren was rumored to have been buying Allstate at approximately $18 a share. (As of this writing, this rumor has not been confirmed. We shall assume it is true for the purposes of the hypothetical.) Allstate in 2000 had 749 million shares outstanding, which gave it a market cap of $13.4 billion (749 million shares x $18 a share = $13.4 billion.) It earned approximately $2.2 billion a year. This means that if you spent $13.4 billion buying all of Allstate in 2000, so that you owned the entire company, you would have earned $2.2 billion in income, which equates to approximately 16.4% a year on your money. This is a much better deal than you would have gotten by paying $97 billion for Yahoo! to earn only $220 million, which equates to earning less than 1% a year on your money. In fact, an investment in Allstate is a much better investment than Uncle Sam's treasury bonds.</p><p>In truth it is doubtful that anyone other than Warren and a few financial titans are going to cough up $97 billion for a company. We small frys are stuck buying fractional interests in these companies. But remember, Warren believes that if it isn't worth buying the whole company, you shouldn't even buy one share. He also believes that if it is worth buying the entire company, one should buy as many shares as possible.</p><p>So suppose we invested $50,000 in Yahoo! on March 10, 2000. Let's also assume that on March 10, 2000, Warren invested $50,000 in Allstate when it was trading at $18 a share. By April of 2001, Yahoo! had dropped from $178 a share to $15 a share, giving us a loss of approximately 91%, reducing our $50,000 investment in Yahoo! to $4,215. The stock price dropped because investors got tired waiting for the $6.7 billion in earnings to arrive. Remember, grim economic reality can drag a stock price to the ground. If the earnings don't show up, investors don't either.</p><p>On the other hand, Warren's Allstate investment grew from $18 a share to $40, giving him a 122% return, increasing his $50,000 investment to approximately $111,111. Warren was in good hands with Allstate because he wasn't buying pie in the sky, but real earnings at a price that made business sense. (It is interesting to note that one of the reasons why Allstate was selling so cheap was that everyone else was out chasing the fast bucks being made in Internet stocks. Investors' money fled the old economy for the new economy. They didn't want to own a stodgy old insurance company. The price of its shares went down and created Warren's rumored buying opportunity.)</p><p>What keeps Warren from investing in transforming industries is a lack of a durable competitive advantage, plus astronomical selling prices that don't make business sense given the economic reality of the business. If doesn't make sense to buy the entire business, it doesn't make sense to buy a single share no matter how sweet the pie looks.</p><p><b>WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS CHAPTER</b></p><p>* Lack of a historical durable competitive advantage keeps Warren from investing in emerging industries.</p><p>* When Warren considers whether to make an investment in Company X, he asks himself the following question: If the company in question had a market cap of $5 billion and I had $5 billion sitting in my bank account, would it be a wise use of my money to buy the whole company?</p><p>* Warren likes to play a little game and pretend that he is going to buy the whole business. He believes that if the entire company isn't worth purchasing at the current stock market price, he shouldn't buy even one share.</p><p>Copyright � 2002 by Mary Buffett and David Clark</p></p><h2>The Embroidered Garden: Stitching through the Seasons of a Flower Garden (Make Good: Japanese Craft Style)</h2><p>Whimsical, beautiful embroidery motifs created by an avid gardener&#x2014;stitch roses, bees, or whole garden scenes.<br><br>Kazuko Aoki has a unique talent for translating the beauty of the garden with needle and thread.

That is, let&#39;d first assess where the needs are in this growing Christian, discern what God is doing in his or her life, and partner with HIM in the process. The first eight chapters give practical, general help in what is involved in the discipling process. The next twelve chapters focus on initial follow-up of a new Christian - the first twelve things you should do with a new believer in Christ. The final section helps the reader lay out a plan for a lifetime of discipling, using the Personal Disciplemaking Tool Kit. The approach can be used in a one-to-one mentoring relationship, or as a curriculum for small group discipling.</p><p>You'll discover in this book the first twelve things to do with a brand new Christian. You'll learn how to assess a person's spiritual profile and tailor-make a program to suit his makeup and needs. You'll see what the Bible has to say about the long-term process of spiritual growht and how you can fit into it.

Upon graduation he joined the staff of the Athletes in Action Track Team, part of the athletic ministry of Campus Crusade for Christ. As a decathlete, he competed for Team USA internationally in 1975, placing 7th at the National Championships. With an increasing burden for training Christians how to disciple others, he and his wife Rahnella founded Disciplemakers International in 1988 - at the time a ministry of Campus Crusade for Christ. It was during this period that he wrote Personal Disciplemaking and Connecting With God. In 2005, Chris &amp; Rahnella felt led to take what they had learned into a new field of ministry: to combat veterans who were struggling with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. They joined the staff of Campus Crusade for Christ's Military Ministry (now Cru Military). They became subject matter experts on PTSD for the ministry, and discovered that many of the same principles that help a person grow to maturity as a Christian also help a combat veteran with soul wounds to heal. They wrote The Combat Trauma Healing Manual and When War Comes Home during that time. In 2011 they founded their own ministry to the military and first responders called "Branches of Valor" and wrote The First Responder Healing Manual. In 2018, Branches of Valor merged with Reboot Combat Recovery - a ministry to the military that grew out of the Adsit's manuals. Also in 2018, they launched a new ministry to first responders known as "Firstline."</p><h2>Tantra: Path of Ecstasy</h2><p>Tantra&#x2014;often associated with Kundalini Yoga&#x2014;is a fundamental dimension of Hinduism, emphasizing the cultivation of "divine power" <i>(shakti)</i> as a path to infinite bliss. Tantra has been widely misunderstood in the West, however, where its practices are often confused with eroticism and licentious morality. <i>Tantra: The Path of Ecstasy </i> dispels many common misconceptions, providing an accessible introduction to the history, philosophy, and practice of this extraordinary spiritual tradition. <br><br>The Tantric teachings are geared toward the attainment of enlightenment as well as spiritual power and are present not only in Hinduism but also Jainism and Vajrayana Buddhism. In this book, Georg Feuerstein offers readers a clear understanding of authentic Tantra, as well as appropriate guidance for spiritual practice and the attainment of higher consciousness.</p><p>Consider for a moment that the Dalai Lama is a tantric adept, and those visions of sexual bliss that the word "tantra" conjures up quickly dissolve. Tantra is more than the sex play of popular articles and books. Georg Feuerstein, authority of the yogic traditions, conjures up a much richer world of Hindu cosmology, philosophy, and theology. Tantra is a form of devotionalism, in which ritual sounds, gestures, and actions figure prominently. Reverence of the guru as god also plays a part, but Feuerstein tempers our suspicion by repeating the admonitions of tantric texts down through the ages to choose carefully. As much prudence must also go into reflection on the disciple's own person, who engages in strict yogic discipline designed to conquer the six enemies: desire, anger, greed, delusion, pride, and envy. Feuerstein draws on the ancient texts to describe the tantric path in great detail, including realization of the subtle body, directing energy through the chakras, and, yes, sex. Taken together, tantra becomes a vivid, multifaceted path to self-realization. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Georg Feuerstein, PhD, (1947&#x2013;2012) is internationally respected for his work on Yoga and is the author of over fifty books. He designed and taught several distance-learning courses on Yoga philosophy for Traditional Yoga Studies.

The nineties was, as Dickens once said, the best of times and the worst of times, but it will always be the era when punk rock conquered the world and in doing so made things a little better and Ian Winwood perfectly captures the history of, and everything that made that moment in time special, with <i>Smash!</i>."&#x2015;<b><i>Mass Movement</i></b><br><br>"Winwood goes into depth about all things punk, getting commentary straight from many of the musicians that helped punk go mainstream.

Rather it's a history of those who made the biggest impact...A loving homage to a forgotten era of punk...It's not only a story about the bands, but it's also a story about how punk rock rose from the ashes to conquer once again."&#x2015;<b><i>Genre Is Dead</i></b><br><br>"<i>Smash!</i> is a compelling narrative of what led up to the punk breakout...It gives unparalleled access to the key artists, letting their voices shine through...This is important not just for fans of those particular groups but also for anyone trying to understand how punk rock became viable as a mainstream, commercial genre of music."&#x2015;<b><i>Oy Oy Oy Gevalt!</i></b><br><br>"If you have any interest in how punk came to be the beast that it is today, you should seek out <i>Smash!</i>.

The sea was wild and stormy, casting salt spray thirty feet into the air. All the other passengers on the ocean liner, including her mother, had taken sensible refuge in their cabins.<br> <br>But it is not always sensible to be sensible.<br> <br>Vita had slipped away and stood out in the open, gripping the rail with both hands as the boat crested a wave the size of an opera house. So it was that she alone had the first sight of the city.<br> <br>&#x201c;There she is!&#x201d; called a deckhand. &#x201c;In the distance, port side!&#x201d;<br> <br>New York climbed out of the mist, sky-high and gray blue and beautiful; so beautiful that it pulled Vita forward to the bow of the boat to stare. She was leaning over the railing, as far out as she dared, when something came flying at her head.<br> <br>She gasped and ducked low. A seagull was chasing a young crow, pecking at its back, wheeling and shrieking in midair. Vita frowned. This wasn&#x2019;t, she thought, a fair fight. She felt in her pocket, and her fingers closed on an emerald-green marble. She took aim, a brief and angry calculation of distance and angle, drew back her arm, and threw.<br> <br>The marble caught the seagull on the exact center of the back of its skull. The gull gave the scandalized cry of an angry duchess, and the crow spun in the air and sped back toward the skyscrapers of New York.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>They took a cab from the docks. Vita&#x2019;s mother carefully counted out a handful of coins, and handed the driver the address. &#x201c;As close as we can get for that, please,&#x201d; she said, and he took in her carefully mended hems and nodded.<br> <br>Manhattan sped past outside the window, bright bursts of color amid the storm-beaten brick and stone. They passed a cinema, its walls adorned with pictures of Greta Garbo, and a man selling hot lobster claws out of a cart. A tram thundered past at an intersection, narrowly missing a van advertising the Colonial Pickle Works. Vita breathed in the city. She tried to memorize the layout of the streets, to build a map behind her eyes; she whispered the names: &#x201c;Washington Street, Greenwich Avenue.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>When the money ran out, they walked. They went as fast as Vita could go in the ferocious wind, suitcases in hand, along Seventh Avenue, dodging men in pinstripes and sharp-heeled women.<br> <br>&#x201c;There!&#x201d; said Vita&#x2019;s mother. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Grandpa&#x2019;s flat.&#x201d;<br> <br>The apartment building on the corner of Seventh Avenue and West Fifty-Seventh Street rose up, tall and stately in brownstone, from the busy pavement. A newspaper boy stood outside, roaring the headlines into the wind.<br> <br>Across the road from the apartment block stood a light-red-brick building, its facade arched and ornamented. Flagpoles protruded from its wall, and two flags flapped wildly. Above them, picked out in colored glass, were the words CARNEGIE HALL.<br> <br>&#x201c;It all looks very . . . smart,&#x201d; said Vita. The apartment block appeared to purse its lips at the world. &#x201c;Are you sure this is the place?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure,&#x201d; said her mother. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s on the top floor, right under the roof. It used to be the maid&#x2019;s apartment. It&#x2019;ll be a squeeze, but it&#x2019;s not for long.&#x201d; Their return ticket was booked for three weeks&#x2019; time. Enough time, said Vita&#x2019;s mother, to sort out Grandpa&#x2019;s papers, pack his few things, and persuade him to come home with them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; Her mother&#x2019;s voice sounded unnaturally bright. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go and find him.&#x201d;<br> <br>The elevator was broken, so Vita half ran up the stairs to Grandpa&#x2019;s apartment, jerkily, as fast as her legs would take her. Her suitcase banged against the walls as she raced up narrow flights of stairs, ignoring the growing pain in her left foot. She came to rest, breathless, outside the door. She knocked, but there was no response.<br> <br>Vita&#x2019;s mother came, panting, up the final flight of stairs. She bent to pick the apartment key from under the mat. She hesitated, looking down at her daughter. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he won&#x2019;t be as bad as we feared,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mama! He&#x2019;s waiting!&#x201d;<br> <br>Her mother opened the door, and Vita went tearing down the hall; and then, in the doorway, she froze.<br> <br>Grandpa had always been thin; handsome and lean, with long fine hands and shrewd blue-green eyes. Now he was gaunt, and his eyes had drawn back into his skull. His fingers had curled inward into fists, as if every part of him was pulling back from the world. A walking stick leaned against the wall next to his chair&#x2014;he hadn&#x2019;t needed a walking stick before.<br> <br>He had not seen her, and, just for that second, his face looked sculpted from solid grief.<br> <br>&#x201c;Grandpa!&#x201d; said Vita.<br> <br>But then he turned, and his face was transfigured with light, and she could breathe again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Rapscallion!&#x201d; He stood and Vita hurled herself into his arms, and he laughed, winded by the impact.<br> <br>&#x201c;Julia,&#x201d; he said, as Vita&#x2019;s mother came in, &#x201c;I only got your telegram three days ago, or I would have stopped you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Vita&#x2019;s mother shook her head. &#x201c;Just try to hold us back, Dad.&#x201d;<br> <br>Grandpa turned to Vita. &#x201c;Smile again for me, Rapscallion?&#x201d;<br> <br>So she smiled, at first naturally, and then, when he didn&#x2019;t look away, wider, until it felt like every single one of her teeth was showing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Rapscallion,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You have your grandmother&#x2019;s smile, still.&#x201d; Vita&#x2019;s stomach suddenly clenched as she saw tears rise up in her grandpa&#x2019;s eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Grandpa?&#x201d;<br> <br>He coughed, and smiled, and cleared his throat. &#x201c;God, it&#x2019;s good to see you. But there was no need.&#x201d;<br> <br>Julia pushed Vita toward the door. &#x201c;Go and find your room, darling,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; said her mother. Her face was white, and exhausted. &#x201c;Now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the one at the end of the corridor,&#x201d; said Grandpa. &#x201c;More of a cupboard than a room, I&#x2019;m afraid,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But the view is very fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Vita went slowly down the corridor, her suitcase in hand. She noticed how the floorboards squeaked; how the paint peeled from the wall. She pushed at the door. It stuck; she held on to the wall and kicked it with her stronger foot. It flew open, scattering thin shards of plaster.<br> <br>The room was so small she could practically touch all four walls at once, but it had a wooden wardrobe, and a window looking out over the street. Vita sat on the bed, pulled off her left shoe, and took her foot in both hands. She dug her fingers into the sole, pointing and flexing her toes, and tried to think.<br> <br>They had arrived. She should be thrilled. They had made it across the ocean, halfway around the world, and New York waited outside the window, stretching up to the sky like the calligraphy of a particularly flamboyant god.<br> <br>But none of that mattered at all, because Grandpa wasn&#x2019;t as bad as she had feared. He was worse.<br> <br>Vita&#x2019;s skirt pockets were full of gravel from the garden back home; she picked out the largest stones and began to throw them at the wardrobe door. It helped her think.<br> <br>A person watching might have noted that each hit the precise mathematical center of the wardrobe handle&#x2014;but nobody was watching, and Vita herself barely noticed. Her mind was not on the stones.<br> <br>She had to do something to make it right. She did not yet know what, nor how, but love has a way of leaving people no choice.</p><h2>Fandex Family Field Guides: Presidents</h2><p><b>The family field guide to America's presidents, now updated for 2017 and featuring the 45th President of the United States, Donald J.

Most men would end their days in bed or take their own lives, but a gunfighter has a third option, one that Books decides to exercise. He may choose his own executioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; As word spreads that the famous assassin has incurable cancer, an assortment of human vultures gathers to feast on the corpse--among them a gambler, a rustler, a clergyman, an undertaker, an old love, a reporter, even an admiring teenager. What follows is the last courageous act in Books's own legend.&nbsp;&nbsp; This classic, Spur Award-winning novel was chosen by the Western Writers of America as one of the best western novels ever written and was the inspiration for John Wayne's last great starring role in the acclaimed 1976 film adaptation. The Bison Books edition includes a new introduction by the author's son, Miles Swarthout, in which he discusses his father's work and the making of the legendary film.</p><p>&nbsp; The Shootist is John Bernard Books, a man of principle and the only surviving gunfighter in a vanishing American West.&nbsp; He rides into El Paso in the year 1901, on the day Queen Victoria died, there to be told by a doctor that he must soon confront the greatest shootist of all: Death.&nbsp; In such a showdown, against such an antagonist, he cannot win.&nbsp;Most men may end their days&nbsp; in bed or take their own lives, but a man-killer has a 3rd option, one which Books decides to exercise.&nbsp; He may choose his own executioner. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; As word spreads that the famous assassin has reached the end of his rope, an assortment of vultures gathers to feast upon his corpse--among them a gambler, a rustler, an undertaker, an old love, a reporter, even a boy.&nbsp; Books outwits them, however, by selecting the where, when, who, and why of his death, and writing in fire from a pair of Remingtons the last courageous act of his own legend.&nbsp; The climatic gunfight itself is an incredible performance by an incredible man, and by his creator, Glendon Swarthout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shootist will&nbsp;rank with such classics as Shane and The Ox-Bow Incident, but it is much more than a Western.&nbsp; When, in the final afternoon of his life, J. B. Books crosses a street and enters a saloon to make something of his death, we cross, we enter, with him.&nbsp; He is us.&nbsp;&nbsp; "From a corner of the south window Gillom Rogers spied on the new lodger. The man unpacked his valise and put things in a drawer of the chiffonier, then hung his Price Albert coat&nbsp; in the closet.&nbsp; When he turned from the closet he was in shirt and vest. The boy's eyes rounded.&nbsp; Sewn to each side of the vest was a holster, reversed, and in each holster was a pistol, butt forward.&nbsp; As he watched, sucking in his breath, the man took the weapons out, revolved the cylinders, filled a chamber in one he had evidently fired,and replaced them before hanging the vest, too, in the closet.&nbsp;The pistols were a pair of nickel-plated, short-barreled, unsighted, single-action .44 Remingtons, obviously manufactured to order.&nbsp;The handle of one was black gutta-percha, the other pearl. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Gillom slipped away to take the horse to the livery, letting the breath of revelation out of his lungs.&nbsp; He was seventeen, and spent much of his time in saloons.&nbsp; He was not yet served, but he enjoyed himself and picked up a great deal of miscellaneous information, some of it true, some of it of doubtful authenticity.&nbsp; But the man in corner room was no stranger to him now.&nbsp; He had heard enough scalp-itch, blood-freeze tales to know that only one man carried a similar pair of guns in a similar manner..."</p><h2>A Shiver of Light (Merry Gentry)</h2><p>Merry Gentry, ex&#x2013;private detective and full-time princess, is now the mother of triplets, a rarity in the high ranks of faerie.

And yet, the middle game is one of the most challenging parts of the contest. It is then that the player has the chance to initiate long-range attacks and create defensive systems.<br>In this excellent study, two great grandmasters combine their talents in a masterly analysis of attack and defense in the middle game. Kotov was one of the great attacking players of the century, and in this book he has written an entire chapter devoted to the strategy and tactics of attacking the king. Conversely, Keres has contributed an outstanding and unconventional treatment of defense, showing how one can defend any position given the right spirit and understanding, no matter how hopeless it may seem.<br>The truth of Philidor's statement that "pawns are the soul of chess" is reflected in a helpful chapter in which Kotov demonstrates that the shape and configuration of pawns in the center have a vital bearing on the way one has to play the middle game. Finally, Keres takes up the difficult but rewarding topic of analysis, offering a practical and extremely thorough analysis of adjourned games, to reveal how a master's mind works and how one should analyze any given position.<br>In addition, there is an authoritative introduction by International Master and chess authority Harry Golombek, who has translated the volume.

Praised by Aristotle as the pinnacle of Greek drama, <em>Oedipus the King</em> is the ancient world&#x2019;s most shocking and memorable tragedy; the story of Thebes&#x2019;s resilient hero and his royal family brought to hellish ruin by fate, manipulation of the Olympian gods, and all-too-human weakness. This is Sophocles, vibrant and alive, for a new generation.<br></p><p><p>Sophocles' most profound and celebrated play in a vivid and dynamic new translation by award-winning poet Robert Bagg</p><p><em>Oedipus the King</em> remains, after 2,500 years, a shocking, suspenseful, and highly emotional drama in which a royal family is brought to hellish ruin by fate, an inscrutable god, and the kindness of a stranger.</p><p>Oedipus must find and destroy the murderer of his predecessor, King Laios, to rid Thebes of the plague caused by the killer's undetected and malignant presence. The play's headlong action resembles a tautly woven criminal investigation, but one whose immense stakes pose a host of wrenching and still unresolved questions: What constitutes human guilt? Why do gods punish the innocent? What are the limits of human intellect? Why do family bonds so often prove destructive?</p><p>Robert Bagg's spare, idiomatic, and nuanced translation is ideally suited for reading, teaching, or performing. This is Sophocles for a new generation.</p>Robert Bagg is the author of five books of poetry, including Madonna of the Cello, a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. Prix de Rome, Guggenheim, Rockefeller, NEA, and NEH fellowships have supported his projects.

It was also one of the war's bloodiest and most pivotal battles, whose outcome would shape international politics for decades to come.<br> <br><i>The Last Battle</i> is Cornelius Ryan's compelling account of this final battle, a story of brutal extremes, of stunning military triumph alongside the stark conditions that the civilians of Berlin experienced in the face of the Allied assault. As always, Ryan delves beneath the military and political forces that were dictating events to explore the more immediate imperatives of survival, where, as the author describes it, &#x201c;to eat had become more important than to love, to burrow more dignified than to fight, to exist more militarily correct than to win.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>The Last Battle</i> is the story of ordinary people, both soldiers and civilians, caught up in the despair, frustration, and terror of defeat. It is history at its best, a masterful illumination of the effects of war on the lives of individuals, and one of the enduring works on World War II.</p><p>12 1.5-hour cassettes<b>Cornelius Ryan</b> was born in 1920 in Dublin, Ireland, where he was raised. He became one of the preeminent war correspondents of his time, flying fourteen bombing missions with the Eighth and Ninth U.S. Air Forces and covering the D-Day landings and the advance of General Patton's Third Army across France and Germany. After the end of hostilities in Europe, he covered the Pacific War. In addition to his classic works <i>The Longest Day, The Last Battle</i>, and <i>A Bridge Too Far</i>, he is the author of numerous other books, which have appeared throughout the world in 19 languages. Awarded the Legion of Honor by the French government in 1973, Mr. Ryan was hailed at that time by Malcolm Muggeridge as "perhaps the most brilliant reporter now alive." He died in 1976.</p><h2>Bats at the Library</h2><p>Houghton Mifflin Company Another inky evening&#x2019;s here&#x2014; The air is cool and calm and clear.<br>Can it be true?

He&nbsp;has written and illustrated more than twenty books for children. Born in Princeton, New Jersey, Brian lives on the South Shore of Massachusetts with his family.<br> www.BrianLies.com&nbsp;</p>PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2014;In this companion to <i>Bats at the Beach</i> (Houghton, 2006), Lies pays homage to the pleasures to be found within libraries and books. The story opens on three winged creatures clinging to an autumnal branch against the backdrop of evening. Observant readers will recognize the young bat with yellow "water wings" from the earlier title and notice that the chimney and trees at the top of the page point downward&#x2014;a cue to attend to perspective. The bats are bored, but an antidote is announced: someone left a window open in the library. The golden glow from spotlights on the side of the building and an Arts and Crafts-style reading lamp illuminate the nocturnal adventures in this handsome, traditional space. The bats cluster according to interests. Some peruse "guides to fancy foods" (insect books) and form literary discussion groups. The younger mammals make images of themselves at the copier, frolic in the fountain, play at the computer, and explore the gingerbread castle in a pop-up book. An impromptu storytime brings everyone together, however, and after the pint-size protagonist is literally drawn into the featured book, two spreads reveal a montage of scenes from classic stories, with bats in the starring roles. Lies's acrylics are a successful fusion of fantasy and reality. The rhyming narrative is generally smooth, with enough humor and sophistication to propel readers along.

Common diagnoses for such children are Reactive Attachment Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Bi-Polar Disorder, Conduct Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Depressive Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder.<p>This book, a follow-up to the groundbreaking audio program of the same title, is guaranteed to change the way you view these behaviors.</p></p><p>B. Bryan Post is one of America s foremost child behavior experts. Founder and CEO of the Post Institute for Family-Centered Therapy based in Virginia Beach, VA. The Post Institute specializes in working with adults, children and families who struggle with issues related to early life trauma and the impact of trauma on the development of the mind body system. A renowned clinician, lecturer, and author of several books, video, and audio programs, Bryan has traveled throughout the world providing expert treatment and consultation to a variety of groups.<p> An internationally recognized specialist in the treatment of emotional and behavioral, he specializes in a holistic family-based treatment approach that addresses the underlying interactive dynamics of the entire family, a neurophysiologic process he refers to as, The secret life of the family.</p><p> Post contends that these same dynamics become obvious and are visibly apparent in every relationship.</p><p>He holds three degrees in the field of social work: a Bachelors of Social Work degree from East Central University in Ada, Oklahoma; a Masters of Social Work degree from the University of Texas at Arlington; and a Doctoral degree in Social Work from Columbus University School of Public Administration.</p><p>A maverick in the mental health field, Bryan broke from traditional teachings in the late 1990 s and developed a dynamic theoretical model of human behavior which he coined the Stress Model. When fully understood and applied to nearly any situation the stress model can reveal underlying unconscious expressive states which can transform relationship dynamics. From the Stress Model theory he has gone on to develop both Family-Centered Regulatory Parenting and Regulatory Therapy which both have been taught at the university level, garnering Post international recognition. Of noted interest is also the fact that he has woven his therapy model into breakthrough educational experiences that are referred to as POST Camps for adults, parents, and therapists. These rapid results programs have been changing the lives of struggling adults, parents, and families for the past several years.</p><p>Bryan is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in the states of Virginia and Oklahoma and is registered to practice within various other states. He lives with his wife Kristi and their 3 daughters in Virginia Beach, VA.</p>Reviewed by Jackie Grimes (adoptive parent)<p>I have been a fan of Bryan Post for many years now and have read all his previous books. His new book takes his particular approach to adoptive parenting and repackages it in a way that is more accessible to parents than some of his previous work.</p><p>Bryan Post is an engaging writer. He is adopted himself and was a troubled teen, so he speaks from a place of personal knowledge. His experience and empathy for adoptive parents are what make this book work much of it covers the usual difficult behaviors that are discussed in other adoption literature, but you know he's been there and knows what it s like. His ideas are often challenging; he invites us to take on what he calls a Paradigm Shift in our attitudes to our children. He suggests that all behaviors come from a place of either love or fear and encourages us to understand the unconscious motivations behind our children s behaviors. He explains the Stress Model (TM) which is what drives our children s behaviors and makes them dis-regulated.</p><p>He also covers the Four Levels of Memory, explaining that 90% per cent of our emotional memory is unconscious for example, and gives us insights into how difficult it is for adopted children to operate as a result. And, perhaps most importantly, he delves into the realm of 'Unfinished Business' that's OUR unfinished business, the baggage we bring to parenting based on our personal past experiences and expectations and dreams. His methods require us to look deeply into ourselves and our own motivations and possibly make changes ourselves. This is a challenging message and one which some people might find uncomfortable.</p><p>I would recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with the demands of parenting adopted children wants to try something new. It is easy to read and the format makes it simple to target specific behaviors. --Adoption Today UK April 2010<br><br>As a librarian who spent 27 years in the mental health field, I have watched or been involved in many, many situations where parents or treatment staff struggled with the slippery slope between a young person/child's behavior. Sadly more often than not, the situation quickly turned into a no-win one.</p><p>I read this book with growing interest as I went from chapter to chapter. The author's description of individual situations, suggestions to frustrated parents and their subsequent reports of amazing behavior changes are exciting to read about. How well they work/will work by a parent reading the book and trying to follow them, I cannot say, but I am happy to add this to our library and know several parents who will be eager to check it out and try the suggestions. I will say that as I read through different situations, I found myself reflecting upon how the suggestions and examples might have made stressful interactions with my daughters in years past have a more positive outcome. --Reviewed by John R.

By turns revealing and hilarious, these are stories about the lengths to which some women will go to find a man, keep a man or, most important, keep up appearances. <br><br>Full of surprises, this introduction to the private lives of some fascinating women, whose life stories and lovers will strike us as at once deeply familiar and profoundly different from our own, is sure to bring smiles of recognition to the faces of women everywhere&#x2014;and to teach us all a thing or two.</p><p><b>Marjane Satrapi</b> was born in 1969 in Rasht, Iran, and currently lives in Paris. She has written several children&#x2019;s books and her commentary and comics appear in newspapers and magazines around the world, including <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The New Yorker.</i> She is also the author of the internationally best-selling and award-winning comic book autobiography in two parts, <i>Persepolis</i> and <i>Persepolis 2</i>.This slight follow-up to Satrapi's acclaimed <i>Persepolis </i>books explores the lives of Iranian women young and old. The book begins with Satrapi arriving for afternoon tea at her grandmother's house. There, her mother, aunt and their group of friends tell stories about their lives as women, and, more specifically, the men they've lived with and through. One woman tells a story about advising a friend on how to fake her virginity, a scheme that goes comically wrong. Another tells of escaping her life as a teenage bride of an army general. Satrapi's mother tells an anecdote of the author as a child; still others spin yarns of their sometimes glamorous, sometimes difficult, lives in Iran. The tales themselves are entertaining, though the folksiness and common themes of regret and elation feel familiar. Satrapi's artwork does nothing to elevate her source material; her straightforward b&amp;w drawings simply illustrate the stories, rather than elucidating or adding meaning to them. Characters are hard to distinguish from each other, and Satrapi's depictions of gestures and expressions are severely limited, hampering any attempt at emotional resonance. This work, while charming at times, feels like an afterthought compared to Satrapi's more distinguished work on <i>Persepolis </i>and its sequel. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"I wanted to see those secret parts hidden from road travelers," he writes. And from the waterways of his 5,000-mile voyage, Least Heat-Moon shares a sharp and stirring vision of America. Filling a small bottle with brine from the Atlantic Ocean, Least Heat-Moon and his wise companion, whom he calls "Pilotis," start up the Hudson River in a 22-foot C-Dory that Least Heat-Moon has named <i>Nikawa</i>--from the Osage words <i>ni</i> for river and <i>kawa</i> for horse. The voyage--from New York harbor to the Pacific Ocean--packs surprises, wisdom, regrets, mishaps, candor, and conversations that readers who savored <i>Blue Highways</i> and <i>PrairyErth</i> will delight in. <p> The impetus for <i>River Horse</i> is one of intrigue--less urgent than the departure in <i>Blue Highways</i>--and the narrative possesses a captivating pull as it courses westward through the strongest currents and pauses in the back eddies of contemporary American life. Least Heat-Moon is in his element. Written in short thematic chapters, <i>River Horse</i> plies canals, greets the Missouri's many moods, and challenges chaotic waves. Indeed, the turbulent and placid waters of America flow throughout this well-told story. When <i>Nikawa</i> finally reaches the Pacific Ocean, Least Heat-Moon has discovered a new America in the country he knows so well. He ponders the command that rivers hold on him and celebrates the national treasures that they are. Exceeding 500 pages, <i>River Horse</i> may be a long journey, but when traveling by rivers, America is a larger country. A triumphant book all the way to the salty Pacific. <i>--Byron Ricks</i></p>In River-Horse, the preeminent chronicler of American back roads--who has given us the classics Blue Highways and PrairyErth--recounts his singular voyage on American waters from sea to sea. Along the route, he offers a lyrical and ceaselessly fascinating shipboard perspective on the country's rivers, lakes, canals, and landscapes. Brimming with history, drama, humor, and wisdom, River-Horse belongs in the pantheon of American travel literature. <p>In his most ambitious journey ever, Heat-Moon sets off aboard a small boat he named Nikawa ("river horse" in Osage) from the Atlantic at New York Harbor in hopes of entering the Pacific near Astoria, Oregon. He and his companion, Pilotis, struggle to cover some five thousand watery miles -- more than any other cross-country river traveler has ever managed -- often following in the wakes of our most famous explorers, from Henry Hudson to Lewis and Clark. </p><p>En route, the voyagers confront massive floods, submerged rocks, dangerous weather, and their own doubts about whether they can complete the trip. But the hard days yield up incomparable pleasures: strangers generous with help and eccentric tales, landscapes unchanged since Sacagawea saw them, riverscapes flowing with a lively past, and the growing belief that efforts to protect our lands and waters are beginning to pay off. And, throughout its course, the expedition enjoys coincidences so breathtaking as to suggest the intervention of a divine and witty Providence. </p><p>Teeming with humanity and high adventure, Heat-Moon's account is an unsentimental and original arteriogram of our nation at the edge of the millennium. Masterly in its own right, River-Horse, when taken with Blue Highways and PrairyErth, forms the capstone of a peerless and timeless trilogy.</p></p><h2>The Death and Life of the Great American School System: How Testing and Choice Are Undermining Education</h2><p><b>An urgent case for protecting public education, from one of America's best-known education experts</b><br>In this landmark book, Diane Ravitch - former assistant secretary of education and a leader in the drive to create a national curriculum - examines her career in education reform and repudiates positions that she once staunchly advocated. Drawing on over forty years of research and experience, Ravitch critiques today's most popular ideas for restructuring schools, including privatization, the Common Core, standardized testing, the replacement of teachers by technology, charter schools, and vouchers. She shows conclusively why the business model is not an appropriate way to improve schools. Using examples from major cities like New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, and San Diego, Ravitch makes the case that public education today is in peril and includes clear prescriptions for improving America's schools.<br><i>The Death and Life of the Great American School System</i> is more than just an analysis of the state of play of the American education system.

Are you more interested in facts and figures than in theories? Do you make to-do lists? Would you rather be truthful or tactful? Do you have a few close friends rather than a wide range of acquaintances? Are you more empathetic and compassionate than logical and rational?<br></b><br> These are just a few of the questions about yourself that you can answer with <i>What Type Am I</i>? Based on the classic personality test taken by millions annually, this book will help you to assess your individual preferences in four basic areas: how you relate to the world, take in information, make decisions, and manage your life. Now a family therapist explains this fascinating system in a way that is entertaining and easy to absorb. Renee Baron takes on the complexity of the sixteen personality types and makes them accessible, so you can comprehend them, find your own type, and use the knowledge to enrich your own life. Here is information about individual strengths and weaknesses along with suggestions for personal growth and awareness. Whether you are a duty seeker or an action seeker, a knowledge seeker or an ideal seeker, <i>What Type Am I</i> is insightful, helpful, encouraging, and an eminently useful step in helping you appreciate your strengths and apply them to work, love, and life.</p><p>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator temperament test is given annually to millions of people, mainly business students and job applicants. But what good does it do, short of giving you a catchy-sounding, four-letter abbreviation (ENTJ, ISFP) that you can sometimes use to break the ice at cocktail parties? The aim of this book is to help you apply your knowledge to the benefit of both your work and love life--and to teach you how to prevent personality clashes by slightly adjusting your behavior around others, once you ascertain which "type" they fall under.<p> The four areas covered by Myers-Briggs are how you relate to the world (Extraverting or Introverting); how you take in information (Sensing or iNtuiting); how you make decisions (Thinking or Feeling); and how you manage your life (by Judging or Perceiving). If you don't already know your profile, take the fun and quick 20-question quizzes for each of the four categories. (Do you dislike routine and repetition? Do you prefer to finish one project before starting another, or does that not matter to you? Do people seek you out for warmth and nurturing?) You're then given tons of tips for getting along in this world. ESFPs are warned that they should not get involved in too many activities, lest they forget their responsibilities.

He received the best possible education in rhetoric and philosophy, and traveled to Asia Minor and Egypt. Later, a series of visits to Rome and Italy contributed to his fame, which was given official recognition by the emperors Trajan and Hadrian. Plutarch rendered conscientious service to his province and city (where he continued to live), as well as holding a priesthood at nearby Delphi. His voluminous surviving writings are broadly divided into the "moral"works and the&nbsp;<i>Parallel Lives</i>&nbsp;of outstanding Greek and Roman leaders. The former (<i>Moralia</i>) are a mixture of rhetorical and antiquarian pieces, together with technical and moral philosophy (sometimes in dialogue form).&nbsp;<i>The Lives</i>&nbsp;have been influential from the Renaissance onwards.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Greek</p><h2>The City Tavern Cookbook: Recipes from the Birthplace of American Cuisine</h2><p><strong>Experience authentic early American culinary history at America's first restaurant, without leaving your home!</strong> For history buffs who like to eat, there is no better gift or souvenir of the ultimate American landmark.

When we think about changing jobs, getting married, buying a home, making an investment, launching a product, or retiring, we decide based on how we expect the future will unfold. These expectations are forecasts. Often we do our own forecasting. But when big events happen--markets crash, wars loom, leaders tremble--we turn to the experts, those in the know. We look to people like Tom Friedman.<br><br>If you are a White House staffer, you might find him in the Oval Office with the president of the United States, talking about the Middle East. If you are a Fortune 500 CEO, you might spot him in Davos, chatting in the lounge with hedge fund billionaires and Saudi princes. And if you don&#x2019;t frequent the White House or swanky Swiss hotels, you can read his New York Times columns and bestselling books that tell you what&#x2019;s happening now, why, and what will come next.1 Millions do.<br><br>Like Tom Friedman, Bill Flack forecasts global events. But there is a lot less demand for his insights.<br><br>For years, Bill worked for the US Department of Agriculture in Arizona--&#x201c;part pick-and-shovel work, part spreadsheet&#x201d;--but now he lives in Kearney, Nebraska. Bill is a native Cornhusker. He grew up in Madison, Nebraska, a farm town where his parents owned and published the Madison Star-Mail, a newspaper with lots of stories about local sports and county fairs. He was a good student in high school and he went on to get a bachelor of science degree from the University of Nebraska. From there, he went to the University of Arizona. He was aiming for a PhD in math, but he realized it was beyond his abilities--&#x201c;I had my nose rubbed in my limitations&#x201d; is how he puts it--and he dropped out. It wasn&#x2019;t wasted time, however. Classes in ornithology made Bill an avid bird-watcher, and because Arizona is a great place to see birds, he did fieldwork part-time for scientists, then got a job with the Department of Agriculture and stayed for a while.<br><br>Bill is fifty-five and retired, although he says if someone offered him a job he would consider it. So he has free time. And he spends some of it forecasting.<br><br>Bill has answered roughly three hundred questions like &#x201c;Will Russia officially annex additional Ukrainian territory in the next three months?&#x201d; and &#x201c;In the next year, will any country withdraw from the eurozone?&#x201d; They are questions that matter. And they&#x2019;re difficult. Corporations, banks, embassies, and intelligence agencies struggle to answer such questions all the time. &#x201c;Will North Korea detonate a nuclear device before the end of this year?&#x201d; &#x201c;How many additional countries will report cases of the Ebola virus in the next eight months?&#x201d; &#x201c;Will India or Brazil become a permanent member of the UN Security Council in the next two years?&#x201d; Some of the questions are downright obscure, at least for most of us. &#x201c;Will NATO invite new countries to join the Membership Action Plan (MAP) in the next nine months?&#x201d; &#x201c;Will the Kurdistan Regional Government hold a referendum on national independence this year?&#x201d; &#x201c;If a non-Chinese telecommunications firm wins a contract to provide Internet services in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone in the next two years, will Chinese citizens have access to Facebook and/or Twitter?&#x201d; When Bill first sees one of these questions, he may have no clue how to answer it. &#x201c;What on earth is the Shanghai Free Trade Zone?&#x201d; he may think. But he does his homework. He gathers facts, balances clashing arguments, and settles on an answer.<br><br>No one bases decisions on Bill Flack&#x2019;s forecasts, or asks Bill to share his thoughts on CNN. He has never been invited to Davos to sit on a panel with Tom Friedman. And that&#x2019;s unfortunate. Because Bill Flack is a remarkable forecaster. We know that because each one of Bill&#x2019;s predictions has been dated, recorded, and assessed for accuracy by independent scientific observers. His track record is excellent.<br><br>Bill is not alone. There are thousands of others answering the same questions. All are volunteers. Most aren&#x2019;t as good as Bill, but about 2% are. They include engineers and lawyers, artists and scientists, Wall Streeters and Main Streeters, professors and students. We will meet many of them, including a mathematician, a filmmaker, and some retirees eager to share their underused talents. I call them superforecasters because that is what they are. Reliable evidence proves it. Explaining why they&#x2019;re so good, and how others can learn to do what they do, is my goal in this book.<br><br>How our low-profile superforecasters compare with cerebral celebrities like Tom Friedman is an intriguing question, but it can&#x2019;t be answered because the accuracy of Friedman&#x2019;s forecasting has never been rigorously tested. Of course Friedman&#x2019;s fans and critics have opinions one way or the other--&#x201c;he nailed the Arab Spring&#x201d; or &#x201c;he screwed up on the 2003 invasion of Iraq&#x201d; or &#x201c;he was prescient on NATO expansion.&#x201d; But there are no hard facts about Tom Friedman&#x2019;s track record, just endless opinions--and opinions on opinions.2 And that is business as usual. Every day, the news media deliver forecasts without reporting, or even asking, how good the forecasters who made the forecasts really are. Every day, corporations and governments pay for forecasts that may be prescient or worthless or something in between. And every day, all of us--leaders of nations, corporate executives, investors, and voters--make critical decisions on the basis of forecasts whose quality is unknown. Baseball managers wouldn&#x2019;t dream of getting out the checkbook to hire a player without consulting performance statistics. Even fans expect to see player stats on scoreboards and TV screens. And yet when it comes to the forecasters who help us make decisions that matter far more than any baseball game, we&#x2019;re content to be ignorant.3<br><br>In that light, relying on Bill Flack&#x2019;s forecasts looks quite reasonable. Indeed, relying on the forecasts of many readers of this book may prove quite reasonable, for it turns out that forecasting is not a &#x201c;you have it or you don&#x2019;t&#x201d; talent. It is a skill that can be cultivated. This book will show you how.<br>The One About the Chimp<br><br>I want to spoil the joke, so I&#x2019;ll give away the punch line: the average expert was roughly as accurate as a dart-throwing chimpanzee.<br><br>You&#x2019;ve probably heard that one before. It&#x2019;s famous--in some circles, infamous. It has popped up in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, the Economist, and other outlets around the world. It goes like this: A researcher gathered a big group of experts--academics, pundits, and the like--to make thousands of predictions about the economy, stocks, elections, wars, and other issues of the day. Time passed, and when the researcher checked the accuracy of the predictions, he found that the average expert did about as well as random guessing. Except that&#x2019;s not the punch line because &#x201c;random guessing&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t funny. The punch line is about a dart-throwing chimpanzee. Because chimpanzees are funny.<br><br>I am that researcher and for a while I didn&#x2019;t mind the joke. My study was the most comprehensive assessment of expert judgment in the scientific literature. It was a long slog that took about twenty years, from 1984 to 2004, and the results were far richer and more constructive than the punch line suggested. But I didn&#x2019;t mind the joke because it raised awareness of my research (and, yes, scientists savor their fifteen minutes of fame too). And I myself had used the old &#x201c;dart-throwing chimp&#x201d; metaphor, so I couldn&#x2019;t complain too loudly.<br><br>I also didn&#x2019;t mind because the joke makes a valid point. Open any newspaper, watch any TV news show, and you find experts who forecast what&#x2019;s coming. Some are cautious. More are bold and confident. A handful claim to be Olympian visionaries able to see decades into the future. With few exceptions, they are not in front of the cameras because they possess any proven skill at forecasting. Accuracy is seldom even mentioned. Old forecasts are like old news--soon forgotten--and pundits are almost never asked to reconcile what they said with what actually happened. The one undeniable talent that talking heads have is their skill at telling a compelling story with conviction, and that is enough. Many have become wealthy peddling forecasting of untested value to corporate executives, government officials, and ordinary people who would never think of swallowing medicine of unknown efficacy and safety but who routinely pay for forecasts that are as dubious as elixirs sold from the back of a wagon. These people--and their customers--deserve a nudge in the ribs. I was happy to see my research used to give it to them.<br><br>But I realized that as word of my work spread, its apparent meaning was mutating. What my research had shown was that the average expert had done little better than guessing on many of the political and economic questions I had posed. &#x201c;Many&#x201d; does not equal all. It was easiest to beat chance on the shortest-range questions that only required looking one year out, and accuracy fell off the further out experts tried to forecast--approaching the dart-throwing-chimpanzee level three to five years out. That was an important finding. It tells us something about the limits of expertise in a complex world--and the limits on what it might be possible for even superforecasters to achieve. But as in the children&#x2019;s game of &#x201c;telephone,&#x201d; in which a phrase is whispered to one child who passes it on to another, and so on, and everyone is shocked at the end to discover how much it has changed, the actual message was garbled in the constant retelling and the subtleties were lost entirely. The message became &#x201c;all expert forecasts are useless,&#x201d; which is nonsense. Some variations were even cruder--like &#x201c;experts know no more than chimpanzees.&#x201d; My research had become a backstop reference for nihilists who see the future as inherently unpredictable and know-nothing populists who insist on preceding &#x201c;expert&#x201d; with &#x201c;so-called.&#x201d;<br><br>So I tired of the joke. My research did not support these more extreme conclusions, nor did I feel any affinity for them. Today, that is all the more true.<br><br>There is plenty of room to stake out reasonable positions between the debunkers and the defenders of experts and their forecasts. On the one hand, the debunkers have a point. There are shady peddlers of questionable insights in the forecasting marketplace. There are also limits to foresight that may just not be surmountable. Our desire to reach into the future will always exceed our grasp. But debunkers go too far when they dismiss all forecasting as a fool&#x2019;s errand. I believe it is possible to see into the future, at least in some situations and to some extent, and that any intelligent, open-minded, and hardworking person can cultivate the requisite skills.<br><br>Call me an &#x201c;optimistic skeptic.&#x201d;<br>The Skeptic<br><br>To understand the &#x201c;skeptic&#x201d; half of that label, consider a young Tunisian man pushing a wooden handcart loaded with fruits and vegetables down a dusty road to a market in the Tunisian town of Sidi Bouzid. When the man was three, his father died. He supports his family by borrowing money to fill his cart, hoping to earn enough selling the produce to pay off the debt and have a little left over. It&#x2019;s the same grind every day. But this morning, the police approach the man and say they&#x2019;re going to take his scales because he has violated some regulation. He knows it&#x2019;s a lie. They&#x2019;re shaking him down. But he has no money. A policewoman slaps him and insults his dead father. They take his scales and his cart. The man goes to a town office to complain. He is told the official is busy in a meeting. Humiliated, furious, powerless, the man leaves.<br>1. Why single out Tom Friedman when so many other celebrity pundits could have served the purpose? The choice was driven by a simple formula: (status of pundit) X (difficulty of pinning down his/her forecasts) X (relevance of pundit&#x2019;s work to world politics). Highest score wins. Friedman has high status; his claims about possible futures are highly difficult to pin down--and his work is highly relevant to geopolitical forecasting. The choice of Friedman was in no way driven by an aversion to his editorial opinions. Indeed, I reveal in the last chapter a sneaky admiration for some aspects of his work. Exasperatingly evasive though Friedman can be as a forecaster, he proves to be a fabulous source of forecasting questions.<br><br>2. Again, this is not to imply that Friedman is unusual in this regard. Virtually every political pundit on the planet operates under the same tacit ground rules. They make countless claims about what lies ahead but couch their claims in such vague verbiage that it is impossible to test them. How should we interpret intriguing claims like &#x201c;expansion of NATO could trigger a ferocious response from the Russian bear and may even lead to a new Cold War&#x201d; or &#x201c;the Arab Spring might signal that the days of unaccountable autocracy in the Arab world are numbered&#x201d; or . . . ? The key terms in these semantic dances, may or could or might, are not accompanied by guidance on how to interpret them. Could could mean anything from a 0.0000001 chance of &#x201c;a large asteroid striking our planet in the next one hundred years&#x201d; to a 0.7 chance of &#x201c;Hillary Clinton winning the presidency in 2016.&#x201d; All this makes it impossible to track accuracy across time and questions. It also gives pundits endless flexibility to claim credit when something happens (I told you it could) and to dodge blame when it does not (I merely said it could happen). We shall encounter many examples of such linguistic mischief.<br><br>3. It is as though we have collectively concluded that sizing up the starting lineup for the Yankees deserves greater care than sizing up the risk of genocide in the South Sudan. Of course the analogy between baseball and politics is imperfect. Baseball is played over and over under standard conditions. Politics is a quirky game in which the rules are continually being contorted and contested. So scoring political forecasting is much harder than compiling baseball statistics. But &#x201c;harder&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t mean impossible. It turns out to be quite possible.<br><br>There is also another objection to the analogy. Pundits do more than forecasting. They put events in historical perspective, offer explanations, engage in policy advocacy, and pose provocative questions. All true, but pundits also make lots of implicit or explicit forecasts. For instance, the historical analogies pundits invoke contain implicit forecasts: the Munich appeasement analogy is trotted out to support the conditional forecast &#x201c;if you appease country X, it will ramp up its demands&#x201d;; and the World War I analogy is trotted out to support &#x201c;if you use threats, you will escalate the conflict.&#x201d; I submit that it is logically impossible to engage in policy advocacy (which pundits routinely do) without making assumptions about whether we would be better or worse off if we went down one or another policy path. Show me a pundit who does not make at least implicit forecasts and I will show you one who has faded into Zen-like irrelevance.</p><h2>Grounded in the Gospel: Building Believers the Old-Fashioned Way</h2><p>Historically, the church's ministry of grounding new believers in the essentials of the faith has been known as <i>catechesis</i>--systematic instruction in faith foundations, including what we believe, how we pray and worship, and how we conduct our lives.

Teal&#39;s studies were mostly of instruments other than the saxophone, but as a student at a Chautauqua summer session, he came under the influence of Georges Barr�re, the eminent French flutist. He played bass clarinet with the Detroit Symphony, but he continued to be absorbed by the saxophone. As a result of his acquired expertise and growing reputation, he was appointed to a full-time faculty position as a saxophone teacher by the University of Michigan -- the first ever to receive such an appointment from a major university. During his 21-year tenure, he attracted students from all over, thus exerting an ever widening influence on saxophone teaching and performing.</p><p></p><h2>The American Century and Beyond: U.S. Foreign Relations, 1893-2014 (Oxford History of the United States)</h2><p>In his last years as president of the United States, an embattled George Washington yearned for a time when his nation would have "the strength of a Giant and there will be none who can make us afraid." At the turn of the twentieth century, the United States seemed poised to achieve a position of world power beyond what even Washington could have imagined.<br><br>In <em>The American Century and Beyond: U.S. Foreign Relations, 1893-2014</em>, the second volume of a new split paperback edition of the award-winning <em>From Colony to Superpower</em>, George C. Herring recounts the rise of the United States from the dawn of what came to be known as the American Century. This fast-paced narrative tells a story of stunning successes and tragic failures, illuminating the central importance of foreign relations to the existence and survival of the nation. Herring shows how policymakers defined American interests broadly to include territorial expansion, access to growing markets, and the spread of the "American way of life." He recounts the United States' domination of the Caribbean and Pacific, its decisive involvement in two world wars, and the eventual victory in the half-century Cold War that left it, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the world's lone superpower.<br><br>But the unipolar moment turned out to be stunningly brief. Since the turn of the twenty-first century, conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq and the emergence of nations such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China have left the United States in a position that is uncertain at best.

More than an engaging guide to the subtle intricacies of the sport, Walton's reflective treatise is a graceful portrait of rural England that extols the pleasures of country life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>'The Compleat Angler</i>&nbsp;is not about how to fish but about how to&nbsp;<i>be</i>,' said novelist Thomas McGuane. '[Walton] spoke of an amiable mortality and rightness on the earth that has been envied by his readers for three hundred years.'</p><p>For a book to stay in print for nearly 350 years, its merits must continually entice and allure. <i>The Compleat Angler</i> satisfies that on two counts. On the most obvious level, it remains as good a primer on fishing as any angler would want. But its most enduring distinction--what's raised an essential sporting how-to to the level of literary classic--is the one cast off by its subtitle; Izaak Walton's sometimes convoluted 17th-century grammar can still reel in our imaginations with his graceful evocations of a life free from hurly-burly in the company of friends intent on physical and moral sustenance. "He that hopes to be a good Angler must not only bring an inquiring, searching, observing wit," suggests the master, "but he must bring a large measure of hope and patience.... Doubt not but Angling will prove to be so pleasant, that it will prove to be like a virtue, a reward to itself." Just like Walton's magnificent literary catch.This edition includes Charles Cotton&#39;s additional material, requested by Izaak Walton for the book&#39;s fifth edition.</p><h2>The Essential Keynes</h2><p><b>The essential writings of the 20th century&#x2019;s most influential economist, collected in one volume<br> </b><br> Today, John Maynard Keynes is best remembered for his pioneering development of macroeconomics, and for his advocacy&nbsp;of active fiscal and monetary government policy.

By this time Keynes&#x2019;s star had long been in eclipse. A new orthodoxy had arisen which cut economics off from the rest of life, claimed that market economies were naturally stable, and that the only macro-economic task of government was to maintain sound money. Robert Lucas, the high priest of the new classical economics, is said to have told his students at Chicago University, &#x2018;We need spend only ten minutes on Keynes; we know it doesn&#x2019;t work.&#x2019; The things which worked were unimpeded markets.</p><p>Keynes had set out to destroy the argument of &#x2018;classical&#x2019; economics that a competitive market economy would always ensure full use of potential resources. He invented almost singlehandedly a new branch of economics, macro-economics, to show why this was not true, and to justify active fiscal and monetary policy. The task of overturning orthodox theory seemed all the more urgent in the wake of the Great Depression of 1929&#x2013;33. The result was <i>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</i>, whose publication in 1936 is conventionally taken to be the start of the Keynesian Revolution. Its main policy fruit was the commitment, till the mid-1970s, by most Western governments, to maintain high and stable levels of employment. The charge that Keynes failed to provide secure micro-foundations for his macro-theory, as well as the contentious implications of that theory for the role of state, led to the view that Keynesian theory was flawed and Keynesian policy led to inflation.</p><p>So when the world economy collapsed in 2008&#x2013;9 the only thing most younger economists, policy-makers and businessmen knew about Keynes was that one did not need to know anything about him. He had largely vanished from their textbooks, briefings and indeed from their consciousness. This left them unprepared for the catastrophic nature of the economic collapse. Today macro-economics is disabled. We are still struggling experimentally with the aftermath of the banking collapse. People talk of the need for a new Keynes. But the old Keynes still has superlative wisdom to offer for a new age.</p><p>Students and others are hungry for clues to the riddle of economic life. There have been many books about Keynes, including a rather massive one of my own. But Keynes&#x2019;s own writings are largely unavailable. The purpose of this single-volume Keynes reader &#x2013; I have called it <i>The Essential Keynes</i> &#x2013; is to give the reader a flavour of the quality of Keynes&#x2019;s mind, style and range, and his approach to ethical, theoretical and practical problems which, so far from having vanished, clamour for a contemporary answer. Keynes is known, if at all, only as the creator of a short-run theory of fiscal stabilization. This was the fiscal tool which emerged from the ferment of ideas in his day. But it was in his explorations of the problem of capitalist instability, and his futurist vision of a world without work, that many today will find their inspiration. My hope is that the selections I have chosen, which include some writings never before published, will provide both meat for the student and food for a wider public. Above all, this book provides readers with the opportunity to acquaint themselves with one of the most remarkable thinkers and characters of the twentieth century.</p><b>II</b><p>John Maynard Keynes was born at 6 Harvey Road, Cambridge, England on 5 June 1883 into an academic family. He was the eldest son of John Neville Keynes, a logician and economist, and Florence Ada Brown, the daughter of a Congregational divine. He had an outstandingly successful school career at Eton College, which was followed by an equally glittering undergraduate one at King&#x2019;s College, Cambridge, where he gained a first-class honours degree in Mathematics, wrote papers on the medieval theologian Peter Abelard and the Conservative political philosopher Edmund Burke and became president of the Cambridge Union and the University Liberal Club. Of crucial importance to his intellectual and moral formation was his election, in 1902, to the Cambridge Apostles, an exclusive &#x2018;conversation&#x2019; society, where he fell under the influence of the philosopher G. E. Moore, and which brought him the friendship of the subversive biographer Lytton Strachey. Moore&#x2019;s <i>Principia Ethica</i> remained his &#x2018;religion under the surface&#x2019; for the rest of his life. It taught that the highest forms of civilized life were friendship, aesthetic enjoyments and the pursuit of truth. His economic activities were always in the service of these ethical goals. That is why he wanted the economic machine to work full blast till the material conditions for the &#x2018;good life&#x2019; were achieved, at which point economists might retire in favour of philosophers.</p><p>In 1906 Keynes was placed second in the Civil Service Examination, his worst marks being in economics, which he had studied briefly under Alfred Marshall, professor of economics at Cambridge University. (He never got a degree in economics.) After two years in the India Office, in which he wrote a thesis on probability in his spare time, he started lecturing on monetary economics at Cambridge; in 1909 his thesis won him a fellowship at King&#x2019;s College, which remained his academic home for the rest of his life. His membership of the Bloomsbury group, a commune of Cambridge-connected writers and painters who lived in the Bloomsbury district of London, dates from the start of his friendship with the painter Duncan Grant, Lytton Strachey&#x2019;s cousin, in 1908. In 1913 he published his first book, <i>Indian Currency and Finance</i>, and served on the Royal Commission on Indian Finance and Currency. Cambridge and Bloomsbury formed the two fortresses of his spiritual life, from which radiated out his friendships, interests and activities in the great world of affairs.</p><p>Keynes&#x2019;s advice to the UK Treasury helped to avert the collapse of the gold standard in the banking crisis of August 1914 which accompanied the outbreak of the First World War. From January 1915 to June 1919 he was a temporary civil servant at the Treasury, showing a notable ability to apply economic theory to the practical problems of war finance. He was against military conscription and would have been a conscientious objector had his Treasury work not exempted him from military service. When Lloyd George succeeded Asquith as prime minister in December 1916, Keynes, then aged thirty-four, became head of the Treasury&#x2019;s new &#x2018;A&#x2019; Division, set up to manage Britain&#x2019;s external finance. He helped build up the whole system of inter-Allied purchases, while chafing at Britain&#x2019;s growing dependence on American loans and the failure to arrange a compromise peace.</p><p>Keynes was chief Treasury representative at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, where he tried unavailingly to limit Germany&#x2019;s bill for reparations, and to promote an American loan for the reconstruction of Europe. His resignation from the Treasury on 5 June 1919 was followed by the publication, in December, of <i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</i>, the book which first brought him international fame. A bitter polemic, informed by both economic argument and moral passion, against Lloyd George&#x2019;s policy of trying to make Germany pay for the war &#x2018;till the pips squeak&#x2019;, it reflected his fears for the future of European civilization. Unless the Versailles Treaty were drastically revised, vengeance, he predicted, would follow.</p><p>In 1925 he took the lease of Tilton, a farmhouse in East Sussex, next door to Charleston, where Duncan Grant lived with the painter Vanessa Bell. This move coincided with his marriage to the Russian ballerina Lydia Lopokova, for whom his love and fascination never waned, who softened the edges of his astringency and who gave his life the emotional stability and regular routine for sustained intellectual effort. Thereafter, his life was divided between Cambridge, London, and East Sussex.</p><p>He was a spectacularly successful investment bursar of his college, King&#x2019;s College, and despite some major reverses, made a small fortune for himself. He was worth �400,000 (�14 million, or $22 million in today&#x2019;s values) when he died. In London, where he rented a house at 46 Gordon Square, he was, at various times, on the boards of five investment and insurance companies, the chief one being the National Mutual Life Assurance Company, which he chaired from 1921 to 1937. Between 1923 and 1931 he was chief proprietor and chairman of the board of the weekly journal the <i>Nation and Athenaeum</i>, contributing regular articles on financial and economic topics. He remained chairman of the board of the <i>New Statesman and Nation</i> when the two journals merged in 1931. Between 1911 and 1945 he edited the <i>Economic Journal</i>. In the 1920s his ideas on economic policy permeated Whitehall through monthly meetings of the Tuesday Club, a dining club started by his friend and stockbroker, Oswald Falk. In the 1930s, he sought to influence policy through his membership of the prime minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council.</p><p>In the 1920s the post-war European inflations, succeeded in Britain by heavy unemployment, formed the background to his two theoretical books <i>A Tract on Monetary Reform</i> (1923) and <i>A Treatise on Money</i> (1930), which dealt with the causes and consequences of monetary instability, and their remedies. These theoretical books chronicle Keynes&#x2019;s &#x2018;struggle to escape from the stranglehold of the Quantity Theory [of Money]...&#x2019;2 They were punctuated by two notable polemical pamphlets, &#x2018;The Economic Consequences of Mr Churchill&#x2019; (1925) and &#x2018;Can Lloyd George Do It?&#x2019; (1929), the latter co-authored with Hubert Henderson. The first attacked Churchill&#x2019;s decision, as chancellor of the exchequer, to put the pound back on the gold standard at an overvalued exchange rate against the dollar; the second was a plea for a large programme of public investment. Reconciled to Lloyd George in 1926, Keynes attempted to provide the Liberal Party with a social philosophy of the &#x2018;middle way&#x2019; between individualism and state socialism, suitable for an inflexible industrial structure. Regulation of demand, he would later write, was the only way to maintain capitalism in conditions of freedom.</p><p>By this time Keynes was the most famous economist in the world, made so by his superb style and the audacity of his ideas. But he had not &#x2018;revolutionized&#x2019; economics, and he himself felt that his theoretical work was incomplete. The Great Depression of 1929&#x2013;32, together with technical flaws in <i>A Treatise on Money</i>, took Keynes back to the theoretical drawing board. What now seemed to be needed was not an explanation of Britain&#x2019;s &#x2018;special problem&#x2019; of heavy unemployment, or even of the business cycle, but an explanation of how plant and labour could remain unused for long periods in a world in which wants were far from being satisfied. He felt this to be both economically and morally inefficient. He drew inspiration from the &#x2018;first Cambridge economist&#x2019;, Thomas Robert Malthus, from whom he got the phrase, and possibly the idea of, &#x2018;effective demand&#x2019;. From the autumn of 1931 to the summer of 1935, Keynes worked on a new book of theory, initially entitled &#x2018;The Monetary Theory of Production&#x2019;. He was helped not just by older economists like Ralph Hawtrey and Dennis Robertson, but by Roy Harrod and a &#x2018;Cambridge Circus&#x2019; of young disciples headed by Richard Kahn, his &#x2018;fav...</p></p><h2>Criss Cross: A Newbery Award Winner</h2><p><p>She wished something would happen.</p><p>Something good.

The author lives with her family in northern Michigan. www.lynnerae.com</p>Perkins's novel, a thoughtful, subtle character study in which paths cross in unexpected ways, is told through vignettes from mostly teen points of view. Perkins's humorous and poignant observations about Debbie, who wants something to happen, and Hector, who learns to play guitar, are compelling. Danielle Ferland remembers her own youth well or has hung out with teenagers recently. Her portrayal of their budding self-awareness bordering on self-consciousness is especially sharp, and she perfectly mimics the questions? teens ask when talking? in addition to their sarcastic downturns and flat tones. Ferland also easily navigates the potentially treacherous waters of Perkins's sometimes- experimental prose, which includes haiku, poetry, and Q &amp; A formats. J.C.G. � AudioFile 2006, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Folk Songs of North America: in the English Language</h2><p>After more than 25 years of intensive research and in the filed collecting, Alan Lomax, the most widely recognized authority on folk songs in the world, assembled over 300 songs in this book which the New York Times called &#34;the fullest, most representative and best edited popular anthology of American folk songs so far compiled&#34;. Besides being a collection of memorable songs, THE FOLK SONGS OF NORTH AMERICA, IS ALSO AN AUTHORITATIVE AND COMPREHSNSIVE HISTORY OF FOLK SONGS IN America. For Mr. Lomax believes folk song is closely related to fantasy and the life of the unconscious and that, in folk songs, the American people have put forth their dreams and their repressed desires, both good and evil. Thus, in tracing the origin and development of each of the songs, Mr. Lomax presents no only a fresh interpretation of American folk music, but, quoting liberally from folk biographies, folk tales, and from other American documents, a peoples&#39; history of the United States. For in these folk songs and in folk comment, the people have set down in plain and delightful language their own view of their American heritage. Each of the more than 300 songs is ready to be sung and played - with arrangements that even a beginner can perform. Divided into four sections - North, Southern Mountains and Backwoods, Negro South, and West - each song has either a piano accompaniment or guitar chords. In addition, there are notes by Mr. Lomax on how the songs should be sung, instructions on how to play American folk guitar and banjo, and bibliographies of records and books. Stunningly illustrated, THE FOLK SONGS OF NORTH AMERICA is an invaluable book for both students and fans alike.</p><p></p><h2>Jesus Rediscovered</h2><p>A British columnist and former advocate of atheism describes his discovery of Christianity</p><p></p><h2>Mrs. Malory and Death in Practice (Mrs. Malory Mystery)</h2><p>When Dr. Malcolm Hardy, a much-despised veterinarian who is even detested by his furry patients, is found murdered, Mrs. Malory sets out to find a killer in a town full of suspects.

Ted Hope, whose films have garnered 12 Oscar nominations, draws from his own personal experiences working on the early films of Ang Lee, Eddie Burns, Hal Hartley, Michel Gondry, Nicole Holofcener, Todd Solondz and other indie mavericks, relating those decisions that brought him success as well as the occasional failure.<br><br>Whether navigating negotiations with Harvey Weinstein over final cuts or clashing with high-powered CAA agents over their clients, Hope offers behind-the-scenes stories from the wild and often heated world of low-budget cinema where art and commerce collide. As mediator between these two opposing interests, Hope offers his unique perspective on how to make movies while keeping your integrity intact and how to create a sustainable business enterprise out of that art while staying true to yourself. Against a backdrop of seismic changes in the indie-film industry, from corporate co-option to the rise of social media, Hope for Film provides not only an entertaining and intimate ride through the ups and downs of the business of art-house movies over the last 25 years, but also hope for its future.</p><p><b>Ted Hope</b> is one of the most respected voices in independent film.

Why in the hell were we out on the streets of New York City shooting a movie? The U.S. military had just launched its massive air campaign in Iraq.

The crew didn&#x2019;t trust Claire or her cinematographer Agnes Godard they were insisting on shooting in chronological script order to help the nonprofessional actors reach a level of emotional truth. What is good for the actors can be something else for the crew and jumping back and forth across the room with your camera is not considered the most efficient way to shoot a movie. Who are these European rank amateurs?&#x201d; the crew was saying. They were threatening mutiny. Then light streaks kept mysteriously showing up on the exposed film stock unbeknownst to us at the time, because it was thirty degrees, the celluloid was conducting static electricity.

A bold choice for recording is carried off remarkably well. S.G.

He is the New York Times bestselling author of twenty-eight thriller and nonfiction titles, including The Intruders, The Minotaur, Under Siege, The Red Horseman, and The Cannibal Queen. A combat pilot in the Vietnam War, Coonts&#x2019;s technical knowledge of aviation and warfare has contributed to the enormous popularity of his novels. The author currently divides his time between his home in Colorado and a farm in West Virginia, where he does much of his writing.Picking up where they left off in Flight of the Intruder (1986), Coonts and his inimitable Navy flyboy, Lt. Jake Grafton, coast on autopilot in this turgid novel of stick-and-rudder derring-do. Long on jargon, acronyms, and technical descriptions but short on actual storytelling, the saga begins in the days following the 1973 US pullback from Vietnam. On leave, Jake pays a visit to best gal Callie McKenzie's home. Callie's pop, a station wagon liberal embittered by the crippling injuries sustained in battle by his son, Theron, has a heated debate with the usually dovish Jake, precipitating an angry flight to a local watering hole. A few glasses later, Jake overhears a drunk taunting a crippled vet and launches the loudmouth through a window. To escape legal reprisal, our hero gladly accepts his first peacetime assignment: instructing Marine pilots in the manly art of carrier-based flying aboard the USS Columbia. Here's where the eponymous A-6 Intruder attack aircraft comes in, and any semblance of plot departs. Sure, there are many new characters: Hugh Skidmore, aka The Real McCoy, a sassy Navy instructor who plays the stock market; Jake's navigator, ``Flap'' LeBeau, a wisdom-spouting Afro-American Marine; and other types running the gamut from fun-loving to psychotic. But action mainly consists of A-6 crews endlessly executing noncombat maneuvers at sea. A difficult task to be sure, but not interesting enough to hold together a novel. In fact, with the exception of a running subplot featuring a ``line-in-the-sand'' conflict with the nearby Soviet fleet and Jake and Flap's bold escape from gunrunners near the story's end, Coonts's narrative style very closely resembles a commander's log--sans command. Those hale enough to finish this muddled flight manual cum novel in one sitting will likely possess enough knowledge about the A-6 to fly one in their sleep. A good thing, since the book certainly won't keep them awake. (First printing of 225,000; author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Stationed in Washington, D.C., after recovering from a nearly mortal wound, Fenn is asked to spy on Marines who may have ties to the peace movement. What Donny quickly learns, however, is that his Navy superiors are more interested in framing <i>somebody</i> than they are in finding the truth. In this first section, readers waiting to discover the outcome of the assassination and glimpse Bob "The Nailer" Swagger will instead be swept away by Hunter's vivid painting of the divided loyalties and torn identities that plagued soldiers and citizens in the early 1970s.<p> But all of this action is only a prelude to Donny's subsequent relationship with Swagger in Vietnam. Hunter fleshes out the mythology that he began to create in <i>Point of Impact</i> as readers watch Swagger add to his famed body count and confront his nemesis, Solaratov. Hunter moves deftly from the mind of Solaratov to Donny and back to Swagger, and in each character finds the core of the Vietnam experience--fear, coldness, sadness, horror, elation.</p><p> The last two sections cut to contemporary events and find Swagger married to Donny's former love, Julie. Slowly, the events of the first half of the book begin to merge with Swagger's present history and stories that readers will recognize from Hunter's earlier novels. Swagger uncovers a deep connection between the Vietnam demonstrations of the 1970s, the predatory work of the CIA, and the killer who is after him and his family now. Nothing is as it first seems, and readers of <i>Point of Impact</i> and <i>Black Light</i> will have to revise all their expectations. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>"Stephen Hunter is in a class by himself. <i>Time to Hunt</i> is as vivid and haunting as a moving target in the crosshairs of a sniper scope."<br>--Nelson Demille, author of <i>Mayday</i><p>"Stephen Hunter is simply the best writer of action fiction in the world and <i>Time to Hunt</i> proves it."<br>--Phillip Margolin, author of <i>The Burning Man</i></p><p>"The best straight-up thriller writer at work today."<br><i>--Rocky Mountain News</i></p><p>"Thrilling in the manner of ancient storytellers, with battles fierce enough for a war and characters crazy enough to fight them to the death."<br><i>--New York Times Book Review</i></p><p></p></p><h2>Debbie Doesn&#39;t Do It Anymore: A Novel</h2><p><b>In this scorching, mournful, often explicit, and never less than moving literary novel by the famed creator of the Easy Rawlins series, Debbie Dare, a black porn queen, has to come to terms with her sordid life in the adult entertainment industry after her tomcatting husband dies in a hot tub.

The smell of flower-scented lubricant filled the air, and hot lights burned down on my sweat-slick black skin. Blubbery and pink-skinned Myron &#x201c;Big Dick&#x201d; Palmer was slamming his thing into me, saying, &#x201c;Oh, baby. Yeah, baby. Daddy&#x2019;s comin&#x2019; home. He&#x2019;s almost there, almost there.&#x201d; There were two high-def video cameramen working us: one moving from face to face while the other focused on our genitals. The still photographer was Carmen Alia from Brazil. The recycling hum of her digital camera buzzed around us like a hungry horsefly circling an open wound.<br><br>&#x201c;More passion!&#x201d; Linda Love, the director, yelled.<br><br>She was talking to me. Myron always had the same passion in any sex scene because he closed his eyes and imagined that he was with Nora Brathwait, his high school sweetheart. She had never let him go all the way and every sex scene he ever did was dedicated to wiping that humiliation from his heart.<br><br>Luckily for me Myron&#x2019;s size pushed his thing against a sore spot deep inside. So when Linda called for more feeling I stopped thinking about the details of the shoot and began to concentrate on how much he was hurting me with his attempt to penetrate all the way back to adolescence.<br><br>I allowed the pain to show in my face with each stabbing lunge.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s better,&#x201d; Linda said.<br><br>&#x201c;Almost there,&#x201d; Myron moaned for what seemed like the hundredth time. &#x201c;Uh-uh.&#x201d;<br><br>The grunting meant that he was about to orgasm. I knew it, Myron knew it, and, worst of all, Linda was aware of what was coming--so to speak.<br><br>Within the next six seconds she&#x2019;d cry, &#x201c;On your knees, Debbie,&#x201d; and I&#x2019;d have to jump down while looking up into the bright lights as Myron Big Dick ejaculated on my face and breasts.<br><br>That was the money shot, the reason I woke up at five a.m., spent hours doing makeup and hair, toes and fingers; it was the reason I&#x2019;d capped my front teeth, had breast implants, worked out two hours a day five days a week with trainer-to-the-stars Efron Fuentes, and shaved my pussy more often than my husband shaved his chin.<br><br>The money shot was not only my paycheck but the salary of every grip, cameraman, makeup artist, and gofer in the room. Our reason for living would spout from Myron Palmer&#x2019;s big pink dick.<br><br>This was no revelation. I had experienced thousands of ejaculations from men of every color, size, and nationality. I had been spouted upon in Moscow, Kingston, Paris, and Johannesburg. This was my job, and the only thing I worried about was keeping the acrid stuff out of my eyes.<br><br>I was preparing to slide down from the sofa onto my knees when something amazing happened.<br><br>Myron grunted and Carmen switched to a double flash setting, Linda cried, &#x201c;Debbie . . .&#x201d; and Myron plunged up against the one spot in my entire sex that still had sensation. I could feel a blast from the air conditioner and the crusty fabric of the sofa where we teetered, me on my back wearing only leopard-print high-high heels and Myron on his knees thrusting, thrusting. And then, completely unbidden, I imagined a tall, olive-skinned man with intense eyes standing in the corner of the crowded room. I knew this man but could not name him. I was moving toward him and at the same time I was being stalked by the most powerful orgasm that I&#x2019;d ever experienced. The faster I moved the closer the feeling came until suddenly I was bucking and screaming, begging for more.<br><br>&#x201c;. . . on your knees!&#x201d; Linda shouted, but I was way beyond taking orders from her. I could feel my nipples getting so tight that they seemed to be pinching themselves, and I felt the full weight of the experience of every one of my thirty-one years.<br><br>Myron pushed me off the red sofa and onto the floor. Then he stood up, drizzling his semen on me while I jerked around like a mackerel just landed on the deck of a day boat off San Pedro.<br><br>I wanted to stop but the orgasm was relentless, like a series of storm-driven waves crashing down on the shore. The only option open to me was to let go of consciousness while Linda and her producers tried to figure a way to save the shot and all our paychecks.<br>I woke up in what was once the nursery of the Bel-Air mansion. The owner of the house had been a movie producer for one of the big studios until his star waned. He foolishly mortgaged his house to finance his girlfriend&#x2019;s film, Fun for Fauna. The movie didn&#x2019;t even make it to DVD and now the owner, Sherman Pettigrew, rented his place for porno shoots whenever he could. Sherman lived in a trailer behind his ex-girlfriend&#x2019;s new beau&#x2019;s house in Topanga Canyon.<br><br>Anyway . . . I came awake on a daybed in the barren nursery of the failed movie producer&#x2019;s house, stillborn into wakefulness after wasting what seemed like the last iota of passion in my life.<br><br>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; a soft voice asked.<br><br>I raised my head and saw Lana Leer sitting on a pink wicker chair. She was very petite, very white, with hair as short as a new recruit&#x2019;s buzz cut.<br><br>&#x201c;I passed out,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s so embarrassing.&#x201d;<br><br>Lana giggled. Then she laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s so funny?&#x201d; I asked even though I knew the answer.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean to make fun, Deb, but it is kinda silly for a woman who&#x2019;s had sex with five men at once to be shy about an orgasm.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where is everybody?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They left. Linda asked me to stay and make sure you were all right but I would have anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>I realized that it was dark outside. When I shifted in the bed I felt the long-lasting slick lubricant between my thighs.<br><br>&#x201c;How long was I out?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A long time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Was Linda mad?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Myron really saved the day. You looked good with him standing over you like that. It looked real.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have to get home, Lana,&#x201d; I said, trying to gather the strength to sit upright. &#x201c;Has anybody heard from my husband?&#x201d;<br><br>Linda reached out and took my hands. She remained steady and I was able to pull myself up.<br><br>&#x201c;No. I called the house but only got the service.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks for staying with me. I remember once in Jamaica that dickhead Lester Foley got me high and left me in a hut on the beach without any clothes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get you cleaned up,&#x201d; the diminutive personal assistant said.<br>There were three police cars, their red and blue lights flashing angrily, parked on the sidewalk, the lawn, and up in the driveway of our home on South Elm in Pasadena.<br><br>Lana and I were walking up the slight incline of the lawn headed for the front door when someone said, &#x201c;Excuse me, ladies; this is a possible crime scene and we&#x2019;re not allowing anyone in.&#x201d;<br><br>He was a small man in a black uniform with blue eyes and pink skin. He recognized me from his porno collection; I could see it in those startled eyes. There aren&#x2019;t many black-skinned women with long white hair and deep blue contact lenses. Debbie Dare was almost unique in the capital of a cliched profession.<br><br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you--&#x201d; he began to ask.<br><br>&#x201c;The owner of this house,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What crime has possibly been committed?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait here, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; he said, and I knew the news had to be bad.<br><br>Lana put a hand on my shoulder. It felt so heavy that I almost fell down. My legs were still weak from the unwanted orgasm and now this.<br><br>The uniform called into the front door of my house. A few seconds later a slender man in a cheap dark green suit came out. He traded a few words with the cop, looked in our direction, and, hesitantly I thought, walked toward us.<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs. Pinkney?&#x201d; he asked, looking at Lana.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Lana said, &#x201c;this is Mrs. Pinkney.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your husband, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; he said, shifting his gaze to me.<br><br>He had passive, maybe even kind eyes and if he recognized me that fact was hidden behind an honest attempt at sympathy.<br><br>&#x201c;What about him?&#x201d;<br><br>The plainclothes cop tilted his head to the side and I couldn&#x2019;t help but think that that was the way he spoke to his mother when he&#x2019;d been bad and had to come to her to confess the breaking of a water glass or leaving a door open, allowing the family pet to escape.<br><br>&#x201c;He expired,&#x201d; the policeman said.<br><br>&#x201c;Expired?&#x201d; Lana asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Died.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh my God,&#x201d; Lana said, and then she began to cry.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>The news hit me like a bucket of cold water. Finally the intensity of my session with Myron was flushed away.<br><br>&#x201c;I want to see him,&#x201d; I said.<br>The electricity was out in the house. Yellow metal stalks with powerful incandescent lamps, brought in by the police, eerily illuminated the sunken all-white living room and the double-wide hall that went past Theon&#x2019;s bedroom and mine. There was an even stronger light coming from the master bathroom. I could see the shadows of people moving around in there, mumbling words that I couldn&#x2019;t quite make out.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe you shouldn&#x2019;t see him like this,&#x201d; the plainclothes cop said at the door.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; I asked him.<br><br>&#x201c;Lieutenant Mendelson.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your first name.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that short for something?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was named after Perry Como. My mother loved his voice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you married, Perry?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Of, of course.&#x201d; He said these last three words showing me the wedding band on his left hand.<br><br>&#x201c;If it was your wife in there would you walk away because some stranger told you to?&#x201d;<br><br>The policeman looked down and I instantly liked him. He took a step back and I walked into the huge bathroom.<br><br>There were three men and two women in there, all of them wearing blue hairnets and thin rubber gloves. One man was vacuuming the floor with a handheld device while another, a black woman, was taking photographs with a digital camera--bringing Carmen Alia to my mind.<br><br>I was further reminded of a porno shoot when I saw the inhabitants of our wide, baby blue circular bathtub.<br><br>My husband, Theon Pinkney, was naked on his back with his big belly up above the waterline. His left arm was around Jolie Wins, a sixteen-year-old wanna be adult cinema star.<br><br>Jolie was my polar opposite with her black hair and pale white skin. She didn&#x2019;t look dead.<br><br>There was a high-end video camera submerged at the far side of the tub. It was plugged into a wall and had tumbled into the impromptu sex scene that they were filming.<br><br>Theon had been a major star in the porn world before he was my husband. He called himself Axel Rod. After he got fat he became a somewhat successful manager before the stars and directors wrested their careers from producers, agents, and managers. Theon probably told Jolie that this was an audition, and he plugged in the camera because the battery had gone dead while he fucked her for hours.<br><br>Theon had lost his physical appeal but he could keep up an erection longer than any man I&#x2019;d ever met.<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs. Pinkney?&#x201d; Lieutenant Perry Mendelson said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br><br>There was the sound of a grunting moan in the background. Again I was reminded of my work.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; the policeman asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Why are the police here, Perry?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;People have died.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it looks like an accident. Do you think he was murdered?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The way we see it the girl&#x2019;s foot got tangled in the wire and, and, and when she . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When she moved to get on top of him the camera fell in,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then why is half the Pasadena police department in my home?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your housekeeper, Mrs. Julia Slatkin, came in and found them. She called nine-one-one and said that it was murder. When someone claims foul play we are legally obligated to do an initial investigation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is this your husband?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The housekeeper already ID&#x2019;d him but I&#x2019;m required to ask.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where is Julia?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She was distraught. I had one of my men drive her home. Do you know the girl, Mrs. Pinkney?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t. Who is she?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t find any identification in her purse.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She looks like a child. My husband was having sex with a child.&#x201d;<br><br>Perry Mendelson looked into my eyes and saw a blank slate. I turned away and went to Lana. She was on the floor in the hall, grunting and moaning, crying with an abandon I rarely felt.<br><br>I went to her and hunkered down. It was a familiar movement, a sex position without a partner.<br><br>I smiled.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, baby,&#x201d; I said. And then to Perry, who was standing above us, &#x201c;How long is this investigation going to last?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We can wrap it up in a couple of hours. I&#x2019;ll have some questions but they can wait until tomorrow if you don&#x2019;t feel up to it right now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That would be great. I&#x2019;m an early riser. And, Perry?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a crime you can have them take Theon&#x2019;s body to Threadley Brothers Mortuary. There&#x2019;s somebody there all night.&#x201d;<br>That night Lana and I lay side by side on white satin sheets under black cashmere blankets. I didn&#x2019;t really need the company, but Lana was a delicate girl and too upset to drive herself home.<br><br>She snored softly and pressed against me. I didn&#x2019;t sleep much but that wasn&#x2019;t unusual. I hadn&#x2019;t had a full night&#x2019;s rest in many years. It wasn&#x2019;t that I was sad or even insomniac. I just didn&#x2019;t seem to need that much sleep. Usually when Theon and I were both home he&#x2019;d have sex with me and then drop off. For most of the night I&#x2019;d read books at random, napping at odd times between chapters or sections; sometimes I&#x2019;d even nod off in the middle of a sentence.<br><br>Over the years I read Tolstoy and Tennyson, Mary Higgins Clark and John Updike, Roger Zelazny and Octavia Butler in the early, early hours of the morning. I didn&#x2019;t finish as many books as some because I usually put down a story I didn&#x2019;t like and reread, many times over, those that I enjoyed.<br><br>If Theon woke up and found me reading he&#x2019;d usually fuck me again. That was his talent--he could have sex anytime with anyone. If he didn&#x2019;t like burritos and cheesecake so much he could have been a porn star up into his seventies.<br><br>But the reason he had sex didn&#x2019;t have to do with love or the physical passion I&#x2019;d felt that afternoon with Myron. Sex for Theon always had a definite purpose, like when he&#x2019;d drowsily awake and see me reading. I was a herd mare and he was an aging stallion running with all his might to keep up.</p><h2>Dear Life: Stories</h2><p><b>A brilliant new collection of stories from one of the most acclaimed and beloved writers of our time. </b><br><br>Alice Munro&#x2019;s peerless ability to give us the essence of a life in often brief but always spacious and timeless stories is once again everywhere apparent in this brilliant new collection. In story after story, she illumines the moment a life is forever altered by a chance encounter or an action not taken, or by a simple twist of fate that turns a person out of his or her accustomed path and into a new way of being or thinking. A poet, finding herself in alien territory at her first literary party, is rescued by a seasoned newspaper columnist, and is soon hurtling across the continent, young child in tow, toward a hoped-for but completely unplanned meeting. A young soldier, returning to his fianc�e from the Second World War, steps off the train before his stop and onto the farm of another woman, beginning a life on the move. A wealthy young woman having an affair with the married lawyer hired by her father to handle his estate comes up with a surprising way to deal with the blackmailer who finds them out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While most of these stories take place in Munro&#x2019;s home territory&#x2014;the small Canadian towns around Lake Huron&#x2014;the characters sometimes venture to the cities, and the book ends with four pieces set in the area where she grew up, and in the time of her own childhood: stories &#x201c;autobiographical in feeling, though not, sometimes, entirely so in fact.&#x201d; A girl who can&#x2019;t sleep imagines night after wakeful night that she kills her beloved younger sister. A mother snatches up her child and runs for dear life when a crazy woman comes into her yard.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suffused with Munro&#x2019;s clarity of vision and her unparalleled gift for storytelling, these tales about departures and beginnings, accidents and dangers, and outgoings and homecomings both imagined and real, paint a radiant, indelible portrait of how strange, perilous, and extraordinary ordinary life can be.</p><p><b>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2012:</b> You half expect a new collection of stories by the beloved Alice Munro to arrive already devoured: pages dog-eared (&#x201c;I feel exactly the same way! How did she know?&#x201d;), spine cracked, cover bent from the dozens of times each story deserves to be read. The best thing to say about Alice Munro is said so often, it doesn&#x2019;t mean much anymore. But here it is for the record: She is a master of her craft. In <i>Dear Life</i>, her 13th collection, Munro again breathes life--real, blemished, nuanced life--into her characters and settings (usually her hometown in Huron County, Ontario). Her empathy is the greatest weapon in her arsenal, and it is on full display here. But the most satisfying part of the new collection is the last four stories, bundled together in what the author calls &#x201c;Finale,&#x201d; the closest she&#x2019;ll ever come to writing about her own dear life. --<i>Alexandra Foster</i>Alice Munro grew up in Wingham, Ontario, and attended the University of Western Ontario.&nbsp; She has published twelve collections of stories and two volumes of selected stories, as well as a novel. During her distinguished career she has been the recipient of many awards and prizes, including three of Canada&#x2019;s Governor General&#x2019;s Literary Awards and two of its Giller Prizes, the Rea Award for the Short Story, the Lannan Literary Award, England&#x2019;s W. H. Smith Literary Award, the United States&#x2019; National Book Critics Circle Award, the Edward MacDowell Medal in literature, and the Man Booker International Prize. Her stories have appeared in <i>The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly, Harper&#x2019;s Magazine, Granta, </i>and other publications, and her collections have been translated into thirteen languages. &nbsp;Alice Munro lives in Clinton, Ontario, near Lake Huron.</p><h2>The Owner-Builder Book: How You Can Save More Than $100,000 in the Construction of Your Custom Home, 4th Edition</h2><p>This easy to understand, step-by-step guide is clear enough for even a novice to understand, Even if you hire a contractor to build you home, this book will greatly help you understand the process.

Tucson, AZ </p><p>"I enjoyed your last edition very much. I was very glad to find this new edition at the bookstore. Because I remodel houses, I watch for all the books on this subject. I've probably read them all. There are so few books out there that you can use. The majority of the construction books are just written to sell.. Yours is written to inform.. Some of the books I just get maybe a paragraph out of that's new. Yours I can use." <br>Cliff S. York, SC </p><p>"We are working on a huge apartment project, and this is coming in really handy. The book gave us the inspiration to get started in the first place." <br>Edmund &amp; Emily M. Coppers Cove, TX </p><p>"This book fell into my hands last year. It was like an answer to prayer. I just devoured the book immediately. I have 20-30 sticky tabs sticking out of it all over." <br>Dorethy H. Topeka, KS </p><p>"The book has been helpful in pointing us in the right direction, and giving us the right questions to ask. We wouldn't have been in as good shape if we hadn't read it." <br>Kurt A. Hayden, ID </p><p>"Excellent book. A lot of useful information a lot of people don't have. Very informative. As a contractor. I sat down with the book. At first I was wanting to toss it out the window. Either this guy is clueless, or he's been there before. I finally realized that the realities of running your own project are right on target. You can run your own project and become your own construction manager. Often the client doesn't have a clue and they are running fifteen subs and don't want to cut loose control and it turns into a nightmare. They are never there, but they hold the power of the purse. When the subs know that you're not cutting the check, they don't paying attention to you . It was very informative and very on target. And this is the wave of where construction will go. A great book to pass on to clients. I've got a client now where they can't get a hold of a contractor. They've done a lot of footwork, but don't have enough information to take the reins and do it. It's very hard to get contractors right now and this is a great resource for people who could do this on their own. This will give them enough to know what they are getting into at the very least. It gets crazy with people who don't know what they are doing. A contractor's perspective. We hear how to sell. And we find contractors that just slam dunk people, and we are trying to build a reputation for doing what's fair. I've laid my books open to people. Everyone talks about leveling the playing field, but that's difficult when there's no one to reinforce the certification of contractors. We find scabs out here who undercut the price but don't carry the insurance, the workmens comp., and they're not above board. We often have to go out and clean up a bad mess. If people really want to level the playing field they have to reinforce the certification of contractors. In stead, let's give everyone the information to be a true owner-builder. We're trying to run a square game. We try to make enough profits to stay in business for another day. We get slammed with high liability insurance, workers comp., and all the overhead. I'm all for people being fully informed. If someone had this information and had their project as well planned as it should be, it would be a joy to work for them. There would be very few problems. That does everybody a service." <br>Larry T. Santa Rosa, CA</p>When we built our own home, a general contractor estimated the cost of construction at $115 a square foot. It was more than we could afford. We had two choices: shrink the house we had planned, or build it ourselves. <p>We decided to build it ourselves, and completed the house for $65 a square foot. The amazing thing was that we didn't sacrifice anything in the original plan. In fact, we included dozens and dozens of upgrades on which we found great bargains along the way. </p><p>We found very little published help on the key issue - saving money - when we were building. So we decided to make it easier for others by writing The Owner-Builder Book. We began by going to the Library of Congress and reading all the books out there on the subject. They were almost all written by general contractors. Believe me, they don't try to help you save money. </p><p>Next we conducted hundreds of interviews with subcontractors, generals, lenders, inspectors, and many other owner-builders. We found answers to all the sticking points like: "Where can I get a construction loan?" </p><p>We found that the average owner-builder saved 35% on the cost of construction against contractor estimate or appraised value. </p><p>I also drew on my experience as a former construction industry executive and consultant. We provided templates for the reader to the three key tools needed for success: Written Budget, Written Schedule, and Written List of Features. These tools were almost nonexistent in the literature. </p><p>We have been honored by reviews or mentions in 165 newspapers and 20 magazines and newsletters to date. People tell us that our book is enjoyable and gives them confidence to build.</p></p><h2>Never Never: Part Two</h2><p>The continuation of the Never Never series.</p><p>Colleen Hoover is the New York Times bestselling author of Slammed, Point of Retreat, Hopeless, and This Girl.

As the personal accounts in Soldados: Chicanos in Vietnam attest, Chicanos were often the easiest and most malleable resource the U.S. had for achieving its quota for combat soldiers. And to those ends, they were used generously. The personal accounts of these veterans, many of whom experienced the war viscerally and whose private reasons were myriad and expressed in this book with a severe authenticity, can be of service to all. They fought for reasons that were ill-defined, often confusing, but for the most part devoid of any cogent understanding of the political and economic forces at play which took them from labor fields in Corcoran, California, to rice paddies in Indochina.

Kazdin</b>, Ph.D., is the John M. Musser Professor of Psychology and Child Psychiatry at Yale University and Director of the Yale Parenting Center. His work on parenting and childrearing has been featured on NPR, PBS, the BBC, and he has appeared on the <i>Today Show</i>, <i>Good Morning America</i>, <i>ABC News</i>, <i>20/20</i>, and <i>Dr. Phil</i>. He frequently lectures to parents, educators, and business groups interested in learning the latest research and techniques of childrearing.Your four-year-old&#x2019;s tantrums have become more frequent and intense; they have started to dominate the life of your household. He&#x2019;s not just yelling and screaming anymore now he throws things, hits, and kicks, too. The bedtime tantrum is the most predictable one, and the one that disrupts home life the most, but he has also taken his show on the road. You&#x2019;ve been late to work recently because he melts down in the morning when you leave him at daycare. After other spectacular public performances at the supermarket, restaurants, and family gatherings, none of which you handled very well, you are sure that others see you as an incompetent parent and you are starting to wonder if they might be right. And, deeper than that, it frightens you to feel the situation slipping beyond your control. You&#x2019;re losing your confidence that you can govern your child, your household, and when you lose your temper, yourself.<br> ***<br><br>You want your nine-year-old to work with you, not against you. You&#x2019;re not asking for blind compliance, but more cooperation would be nice. Right now, she seems to fight you every step of the way, from getting up for school in the morning through homework and dinner and computer or TV time. Sometimes she insists on complete freedom and autonomy; sometimes she acts as if you have to do everything for her. She bickers incessantly with her sister, too. Is it asking too much for you to have a little peace around the house? You&#x2019;re tired of laying down the law, trying to understand her point of view, and using every other strategy that hasn&#x2019;t worked. Frankly, you are fed up with your own child. You find yourself wistfully wondering why you weren&#x2019;t one of the lucky ones who got a nice, easy kid to raise.<br> ***<br><br>Your thirteen-year-old gives you nothing but attitude. On a couple of occasions, he has stolen something or committed an act of vandalism, the most worrisome pieces of a larger pattern of defying authority. You tell yourself that he&#x2019;s going through a phase, that he&#x2019;s just a normal preadolescent, but you fear that he may be heading toward serious trouble. You have tried to talk to him in every way you can think of punishing, explaining, begging, crying but nothing works. Your spouse says you are exaggerating, but you feel it&#x2019;s time to face the seriousness of what&#x2019;s happening to your family. Your child has a good heart, but that doesn&#x2019;t keep you from feeling always a little on edge, not knowing when the next crisis will develop.<br><br>***<br><br>Should you be addressing these problems now, before they lead to more serious ones? Or should you wait to see if a particular problem resolves itself? Perhaps you&#x2019;ve gone online, Googled tantrum&#x201d; or defiant child,&#x201d; and found that your child&#x2019;s behavior fits a dire-sounding label. Perhaps you&#x2019;re more concerned than your spouse is, or vice versa, and it&#x2019;s becoming a bone of contention between you two devoted parents who find themselves disagreeing about what&#x2019;s wrong, how serious it is, how to put it right, or whether to try to fix it at all.<br> The tangle of confusion, frustration, fear, and anger inside you turns spending time with your child into a wearisome, long-running confrontation, even a chore that you secretly dread, and that feels very wrong to you. You&#x2019;ve become a character you don&#x2019;t really recognize, or recognize all too well as the kind of parent you never wanted to be: a frequently irate, sometimes out-of-control shouter who spends altogether too much time ineffectively nagging, threatening, punishing, and even hitting the very child you love as much as you have ever loved or could ever love anyone. You feel off-balance, strange to yourself. You need a better way to be a parent, but you haven&#x2019;t gotten much useful help from the models you may have turned to: the way your parents, bless their hearts, did it; the many ways the child- rearing manuals suggest you do it; the way Supernanny does it on TV. With professional experts of all kinds promising that their way works, with friends and friends of friends telling you stories about how so-and-so&#x2019;s kid was turned around by a new parental strategy or miracle diet or whatever, it&#x2019;s hard to figure out what actually will work for you and your child.<br><br>The Method<br><br>There is a way to establish what actually does work. It&#x2019;s called science. To most people as they go about their daily lives, science&#x201d; means subjects such as the discovery of water on Mars, how birds spread influenza, and what trans fats do to our bodies. All of these are important and consistently newsworthy, without doubt, but science has also been quietly pressing forward in the effort to understand child development, child-rearing, parent- child interaction, and aall sorts of other matters that affect your child&#x2019;s social, emotional, and behavioral adjustment.<br> Within the extensive research on human behavior in geeeeeneral, a great deal tells us specifically about the behavior of children. You may be surprised to hear that scientists have studied the most effective way to give a command to a child, or that they have rigorously compared the effectiveness of rewarding good behavior and punishing misbehavior. There are even studies that tell us very specific things like, for instance, the most effective way to speak to a child when asking her to do something she&#x2019;d prefer not to do: brush her teeth, wear a jacket, get off the phone, or go to bed on time. Obviously, very few parents have the time or training to get up to speed on the latest research in psychology, not to mention child development and neurobiology and all the many related fields. But they can benefit profoundly from what researchers have discovered.<br> In this book, I present a method for changing your child&#x2019;s behavior that is based on good science on what we currently know about children&#x2019;s behavior from the results of sound, well-conducted studies. I do not offer impressionistic beliefs or unsupported opinions about childhood. I&#x2019;ll be telling you something about the research and basic principles that underlie this approach, so you get a sense of why it works, but my emphasis will be on what to do and how to do it.<br> One great virtue of the method is that the same principles and techniques apply to the full range of situations for children and adolescents. I&#x2019;m talking about everything from the milestones of normal child development eating, toilet training, sleeping in one&#x2019;s own bed, not having tantrums all the way to potentially more serious behavior problems like fighting or stealing. The method has been demonstrated to be effective even in those more difficult situations in which there are other problems in the home, such as when parents have physical or mental health problems, or engage in drug use or domestic violence. As long as you are committed to systematically taking this approach to changing the behavior of your child, even an imperfect and partial application of the method produces results.<br> First, you must shift your own focus of attention. As parents we tend to be experts on what we want our kids not to do. For example, I want him to stop whining, talking back, and ignoring me. I will teach you to focus more positively on what you do want your kids to do When it&#x2019;s bedtime, I want her to go directly, quickly, and quietly to bed and give you the tools to methodically reinforce that behavior until it replaces the behavior you don&#x2019;t want.<br> You&#x2019;ll learn how to build up the behaviors you want: how often your child must practice the good behavior in order for it to take,&#x201d; how to set up situations so that the behaviors you&#x2019;d like to see are much more likely to occur, how to create more chances to practice, how to praise most effectively, how to set up and give rewards that work, how to get from the desired behavior never happening to seeing it happen a lot, how to troubleshoot and improve a program that&#x2019;s not working well enough. I will have much to tell you about the details, because they can make all the difference between success and failure.<br> When you commit to positively reinforcing the behavior you want, you can be kinder to your child while being more systematic. We tend to fall into a trap of believing that getting serious about behavior problems means getting negative: more punishment, tougher standards, zero tolerance.&#x201d; But positive reinforcement requires a very different kind of effectiveness from a parent: better praise, more purposeful rewards, greater attentiveness to a child. It draws you and your child closer together as it makes you a more effective parent.<br> Parents who use my method often find great relief in discovering that getting down to business doesn&#x2019;t have to mean bearing down even harder on their children. Being more effectively gentle and positive with your child doesn&#x2019;t mean being spineless. The reverse, in fact, may be true. Flying off the handle, perpetual anger, shouting, hitting those are the truer signs of a defeated, ineffective parent. Positive reinforcement tends to calm a household because it offers clear, attainable objectives for parents and children alike to aim for in shaping behavior.<br> My method does not require a lifelong commitment. The program you&#x2019;ll set up for changing your child&#x2019;s behavior works like a frame you place around a growing plant to train it up straight and healthy. The plant is better behavior, and once it can stand on its own, you&#x2019;ll take down the frame. You will not be awarding points or keeping track of rewards forever. In fact, most parents find that such concentrated interventions take effect very quickly and can be largely discontinued after a relatively short time, like a month or two. The intention here is that you build the frame of this method around your child&#x2019;s changing behavior, but once the desired behavior takes deeper root and gains in vigor, you quickly scale down the frame and then take it down entirely.<br> Where the Method Comes From<br><br>I did not set out to specialize in helping parents improve their children&#x2019;s behavior. I started down the road that led to this method when somebody gave me a problem to solve and I turned to the research for help.<br> That occurred back in the early 1970s, when I was a graduate student at Northwestern University. The director of a local clinic that treated children who had emotional problems asked whether I could help his clients. The one I remember best was Sharon, a fifteen-year-old girl who had terrible, destructive tantrums whenever anyone said no to her or there was even the slightest unexpected change in her routine.<br> When told we would be breaking for lunch, for instance, Sharon would blow up. She threw things, swore with amazing virtuosity, and shouted at the top of her voice. The predictable pre-lunch tantrum could be controlled by announcing to her sixty and then thirty minutes before lunch that lunch was coming, but if the clinic&#x2019;s staff forgot to do this, the tantrum was inevitable.<br> After consulting with researchers around the country, I created a program for Sharon and other clients at the clinic by adapting techniques on learning and behavior that had proved effective in treating adults. The program did not produce overnight miracles, but it did bring about gradual transformations with clear, lasting effects. We could see and measure the changes and, more important, others working with our clients and their families saw the changes. In the case of Sharon, we entirely eliminated her tantrums in about three weeks, step by step, by instituting a system of rewards for small positive changes in her behavior. She reached the point where she would smile mischievously instead of blowing up when we interrupted her. And once we ended the programs, the improved behaviors continued. The programs were temporary; the changes endured.<br> The treatment did not make any attempt to get at a root cause of behavior to determine, say, the ultimate cause of Sharon&#x2019;s rages. We proceeded upon the idea that if you can help the child in the short term to change her behavior, over time you will change the child. The research tells us that building up a better response to replace tantrums, if the new behavior is repeated often enough, will in effect rewire that child&#x2019;s brain so she doesn&#x2019;t jump to rage as the default coping strategy for difficult situations.<br> Sharon&#x2019;s was an extreme clinical case, but I also wanted to bring the research to bear on the more everyday behavior problems that all parents have to deal with. I was appalled by the unending stream of bad expert&#x201d; advice to often desperate parents, who understandably snatched at anything that looked like a tool and rarely had the training to tell what was based on good science and what was not. So I began conducting parenting classes in which we discussed and practiced techniques for changing behavior that parents could use at home. Often the behaviors we addressed were utterly normal ones, like getting a child to eat certain foods, using the toilet, getting ready for school, doing homework, practicing a musical instrument, playing nicely with a sibling, respecting property, and not teasing or hurting a pet. The programs did not always succeed, especially at first, but we constantly evaluated whether change was happening and whether it was happening fast enough. We would adjust the program, measure our progress, and adjust again.<br> I also began working with schools, and when I moved from Chicago to take a job at Pennsylvania State University, I applied what I had learned to help children in local schools there. There were many challenges such as a memorable five-year-old girl who would self-induce vomiting whenever she was mad, thoroughly disrupting the class every time she did it. (She actually turned out to be an easy case.) But as the research on behavior made the leap from the laboratory to meaningful application to the lives of real people, and as the body of that research built up, we had more equipment with which to face those challenges. The accumulating studies began to show conclusively that what many of us do as parents from harsh punishment to endlessly explaining to a child why his behavior is wrong may not work at all and can even make our children&#x2019;s behavior problems worse by giving attention to them.<br> We began teaching parents to catch their children being good,&#x201d; instead of unwittingly reinforcing unwanted behaviors by shouting, hitting, explaining, or otherwise attending to them. And the developing body of scientific research began to show conclusively that small, temporary changes in what parents do at home have large, lasting effects in changing children&#x2019;s behavior at home and at school.<br> After a decade at Penn State, I moved to the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, where, in addition to continuing my research and directing an inpatient service, I continued training parents to change their children&#x2019;s behavior at home over the long term. My colleagues and I also used federal grants to study the techniques we taught, refining them and making them more effective.<br> In 1989, I took a position at Yale University and moved my clinic there. It continues as the Yale Parenting Center and Child Conduct Clinic, which I direct. I am also the John M. Musser Professor of Psychology and Child Psychiatry, and for four years I directed a large research and clinical operation at the Child Study Center at the Yale Medical School. At the Yale Parenting Center and Child Conduct Clinic, the most hands-on of these responsibilities, my staff and I see families of children from ages two to sixteen and apply programs to change child behavior in the home and community. Five days a week, every week, we work with parents who need help with their children. Some families bring us children who are referred by the schools, other mental health services, or law enforcement agencies.

Joan Didion explores an intensely personal yet universal experience: a portrait of a marriage--and a life, in good times and bad--that will speak to anyone who has ever loved a husband or wife or child.</p><p>Joan Didion was born in California and lives in New York City. She is the author of five novels and seven previous books of nonfiction.<br><br>Joan Didion's <i>Where I Was From, Political Fictions, The Last Thing He Wanted, After Henry, Miami, Democracy, Salvador, A Book of Common Prayer, </i>and <i>Run River </i>are available in Vintage paperback.Chapter 1 <br><br>1.<br><br><i>Life changes fast.</i><br><br><i>Life changes in the instant.</i><br><br><i>You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends.</i><br><br><i>The question of self-pity.</i><br><br>Those were the first words I wrote after it happened. The computer dating on the Microsoft Word file (&#x201c;Notes on change.doc&#x201d;) reads &#x201c;May 20, 2004, 11:11 p.m.,&#x201d; but that would have been a case of my opening the file and reflexively pressing save when I closed it. I had made no changes to that file in May. I had made no changes to that file since I wrote the words, in January 2004, a day or two or three after the fact.<br><br>For a long time I wrote nothing else.<br><br><i>Life changes in the instant.</i><br><br><i>The ordinary instant.</i><br><br>At some point, in the interest of remembering what seemed most striking about what had happened, I considered adding those words, &#x201c;the ordinary instant.&#x201d; I saw immediately that there would be no need to add the word &#x201c;ordinary,&#x201d; because there would be no forgetting it: the word never left my mind. It was in fact the ordinary nature of everything preceding the event that prevented me from truly believing it had happened, absorbing it, incorporating it, getting past it. I recognize now that there was nothing unusual in this: confronted with sudden disaster we all focus on how unremarkable the circumstances were in which the unthinkable occurred, the clear blue sky from which the plane fell, the routine errand that ended on the shoulder with the car in flames, the swings where the children were playing as usual when the rattlesnake struck from the ivy. &#x201c;He was on his way home from work&#x2014;happy, successful, healthy&#x2014;and then, gone,&#x201d; I read in the account of a psychiatric nurse whose husband was killed in a highway accident. In 1966 I happened to interview many people who had been living in Honolulu on the morning of December 7, 1941; without exception, these people began their accounts of Pearl Harbor by telling me what an &#x201c;ordinary Sunday morning&#x201d; it had been. &#x201c;It was just an ordinary beautiful September day,&#x201d; people still say when asked to describe the morning in New York when American Airlines 11 and United Airlines 175 got flown into the World Trade towers. Even the report of the 9/11 Commission opened on this insistently premonitory and yet still dumbstruck narrative note: &#x201c;Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And then&#x2014;gone.&#x201d; <i>In the midst of life we are in death</i>, Episcopalians say at the graveside. Later I realized that I must have repeated the details of what happened to everyone who came to the house in those first weeks, all those friends and relatives who brought food and made drinks and laid out plates on the dining room table for however many people were around at lunch or dinner time, all those who picked up the plates and froze the leftovers and ran the dishwasher and filled our (I could not yet think <i>my</i>) otherwise empty house even after I had gone into the bedroom (our bedroom, the one in which there still lay on a sofa a faded terrycloth XL robe bought in the 1970s at Richard Carroll in Beverly Hills) and shut the door. Those moments when I was abruptly overtaken by exhaustion are what I remember most clearly about the first days and weeks. I have no memory of telling anyone the details, but I must have done so, because everyone seemed to know them. At one point I considered the possibility that they had picked up the details of the story from one another, but immediately rejected it: the story they had was in each instance too accurate to have been passed from hand to hand. It had come from me.<br><br>Another reason I knew that the story had come from me was that no version I heard included the details I could not yet face, for example the blood on the living room floor that stayed there until Jos� came in the next morning and cleaned it up.<br><br>Jos�. Who was part of our household. Who was supposed to be flying to Las Vegas later that day, December 31, but never went. Jos� was crying that morning as he cleaned up the blood. When I first told him what had happened he had not understood. Clearly I was not the ideal teller of this story, something about my version had been at once too offhand and too elliptical, something in my tone had failed to convey the central fact in the situation (I would encounter the same failure later when I had to tell Quintana), but by the time Jos� saw the blood he understood.<br><br>I had picked up the abandoned syringes and ECG electrodes before he came in that morning but I could not face the blood.<br><br>In outline.<br><br>It is now, as I begin to write this, the afternoon of October 4, 2004.<br><br>Nine months and five days ago, at approximately nine o&#x2019;clock on the evening of December 30, 2003, my husband, John Gregory Dunne, appeared to (or did) experience, at the table where he and I had just sat down to dinner in the living room of our apartment in New York, a sudden massive coronary event that caused his death. Our only child, Quintana, had been for the previous five nights unconscious in an intensive care unit at Beth Israel Medical Center&#x2019;s Singer Division, at that time a hospital on East End Avenue (it closed in August 2004) more commonly known as &#x201c;Beth Israel North&#x201d; or &#x201c;the old Doctors&#x2019; Hospital,&#x201d; where what had seemed a case of December flu sufficiently severe to take her to an emergency room on Christmas morning had exploded into pneumonia and septic shock. This is my attempt to make sense of the period that followed, weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I had ever had about death, about illness, about probability and luck, about good fortune and bad, about marriage and children and memory, about grief, about the ways in which people do and do not deal with the fact that life ends, about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself. I have been a writer my entire life. As a writer, even as a child, long before what I wrote began to be published, I developed a sense that meaning itself was resident in the rhythms of words and sentences and paragraphs, a technique for withholding whatever it was I thought or believed behind an increasingly impenetrable polish. The way I write is who I am, or have become, yet this is a case in which I wish I had instead of words and their rhythms a cutting room, equipped with an Avid, a digital editing system on which I could touch a key and collapse the sequence of time, show you simultaneously all the frames of memory that come to me now, let you pick the takes, the marginally different expressions, the variant readings of the same lines. This is a case in which I need more than words to find the meaning. This is a case in which I need whatever it is I think or believe to be penetrable, if only for myself.<br>2.<br><br>December 30, 2003, a Tuesday.<br><br>We had seen Quintana in the sixth-floor ICU at Beth Israel North.<br><br>We had come home.<br><br>We had discussed whether to go out for dinner or eat in.<br><br>I said I would build a fire, we could eat in.<br><br>I built the fire, I started dinner, I asked John if he wanted a drink.<br><br>I got him a Scotch and gave it to him in the living room, where he was reading in the chair by the fire where he habitually sat.<br><br>The book he was reading was by David Fromkin, a bound galley of <i>Europe&#x2019;s Last Summer: Who Started the Great War in 1914?</i><br><br>I finished getting dinner, I set the table in the living room where, when we were home alone, we could eat within sight of the fire. I find myself stressing the fire because fires were important to us. I grew up in California, John and I lived there together for twenty-four years, in California we heated our houses by building fires. We built fires even on summer evenings, because the fog came in. Fires said we were home, we had drawn the circle, we were safe through the night. I lit the candles. John asked for a second drink before sitting down. I gave it to him. We sat down. My attention was on mixing the salad.<br><br>John was talking, then he wasn&#x2019;t.<br><br>At one point in the seconds or minute before he stopped talking he had asked me if I had used single-malt Scotch for his second drink. I had said no, I used the same Scotch I had used for his first drink. &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; he had said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why but I don&#x2019;t think you should mix them.&#x201d; At another point in those seconds or that minute he had been talking about why World War One was the critical event from which the entire rest of the twentieth century flowed.<br><br>I have no idea which subject we were on, the Scotch or World War One, at the instant he stopped talking.<br><br>I only remember looking up. His left hand was raised and he was slumped motionless. At first I thought he was making a failed joke, an attempt to make the difficulty of the day seem manageable.<br><br>I remember saying <i>Don&#x2019;t do that</i>.<br><br>When he did not respond my first thought was that he had started to eat and choked. I remember trying to lift him far enough from the back of the chair to give him the Heimlich. I remember the sense of his weight as he fell forward, first against the table, then to the floor. In the kitchen by the telephone I had taped a card with the New York&#x2013;Presbyterian ambulance numbers. I had not taped the numbers by the telephone because I anticipated a moment like this. I had taped the numbers by the telephone in case someone in the building needed an ambulance.<br><br>Someone else.<br><br>I called one of the numbers. A dispatcher asked if he was breathing. I said <i>Just come</i>. When the paramedics came I tried to tell them what had happened but before I could finish they had transformed the part of the living room where John lay into an emergency department. One of them (there were three, maybe four, even an hour later I could not have said) was talking to the hospital about the electrocardiogram they seemed already to be transmitting. Another was opening the first or second of what would be many syringes for injection. (Epinephrine? Lidocaine? Procainamide? The names came to mind but I had no idea from where.) I remember saying that he might have choked. This was dismissed with a finger swipe: the airway was clear. They seemed now to be using defibrillating paddles, an attempt to restore a rhythm. They got something that could have been a normal heartbeat (or I thought they did, we had all been silent, there was a sharp jump), then lost it, and started again.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s still fibbing,&#x201d; I remember the one on the telephone saying.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>V</i>-fibbing,&#x201d; John&#x2019;s cardiologist said the next morning when he called from Nantucket. &#x201c;They would have said &#x2018;<i>V</i>-fibbing.&#x2019; V for ventricular.&#x201d;<br><br>Maybe they said &#x201c;V-fibbing&#x201d; and maybe they did not. Atrial fibrillation did not immediately or necessarily cause cardiac arrest. Ventricular did. Maybe ventricular was the given.<br><br>I remember trying to straighten out in my mind what would happen next. Since there was an ambulance crew in the living room, the next logical step would be going to the hospital. It occurred to me that the crew could decide very suddenly to go to the hospital and I would not be ready. I would not have in hand what I needed to take. I would waste time, get left behind. I found my handbag and a set of keys and a summary John&#x2019;s doctor had made of his medical history. When I got back to the living room the paramedics were watching the computer monitor they had set up on the floor. I could not see the monitor so I watched their faces. I remember one glancing at the others. When the decision was made to move it happened very fast. I followed them to the elevator and asked if I could go with them. They said they were taking the gurney down first, I could go in the second ambulance. One of them waited with me for the elevator to come back up. By the time he and I got into the second ambulance the ambulance carrying the gurney was pulling away from the front of the building. The distance from our building to the part of New York&#x2013;Presbyterian that used to be New York Hospital is six crosstown blocks. I have no memory of sirens. I have no memory of traffic. When we arrived at the emergency entrance to the hospital the gurney was already disappearing into the building. A man was waiting in the driveway. Everyone else in sight was wearing scrubs. He was not. &#x201c;Is this the wife,&#x201d; he said to the driver, then turned to me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m your social worker,&#x201d; he said, and I guess that is when I must have known.<br><br>I opened the door and I seen the man in the dress greens and I knew. I immediately knew.&#x201d; This was what the mother of a nineteen-year-old killed by a bomb in Kirkuk said on an HBO documentary quoted by Bob Herbert in <i>The New York Times</i> on the morning of November 12, 2004. &#x201c;But I thought that if, as long as I didn&#x2019;t let him in, he couldn&#x2019;t tell me. And then it&#x2014;none of that would&#x2019;ve happened. So he kept saying, &#x2018;Ma&#x2019;am, I need to come in.&#x2019; And I kept telling him, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry, but you can&#x2019;t come in.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>When I read this at breakfast almost eleven months after the night with the ambulance and the social worker I recognized the thinking as my own.<br><br>Inside the emergency room I could see the gurney being pushed into a cubicle, propelled by more people in scrubs. Someone told me to wait in the reception area. I did. There was a line for admittance paperwork. Waiting in the line seemed the constructive thing to do. Waiting in the line said that there was still time to deal with this, I had copies of the insurance cards in my handbag, this was not a hospital I had ever negotiated&#x2014;New York Hospital was the Cornell part of New York&#x2013;Presbyterian, the part I knew was the Columbia part, Columbia-Presbyterian, at 168th and Broadway, twenty minutes away at best, too far in this kind of emergency&#x2014;but I could make this unfamiliar hospital work, I could be useful, I could arrange the transfer to Columbia-Presbyterian once he was stabilized. I was fixed on the details of this imminent transfer to Columbia (he would need a bed with telemetry, eventually I could also get Quintana transferred to Columbia, the night she was admitted to Beth Israel North I had written on a card the beeper numbers of several Columbia doctors, one or another of them could make all this happen) when the social worker reappeared and guided me from the paperwork line into an empty room off the reception area. &#x201c;You can wait here,&#x201d; he said. I waited. The room was cold, or I was. I wondered how much time had passed between the time I called the ambulance and the arrival of the paramedics. It had seemed no time at all (<i>a mote in the eye of God</i> was the phrase that came to me in the room off the reception area) but it must have been at the minimum several minutes.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Dice Man</h2><p>The cult classic that can still change your life!

But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of Chance, even to them that believe accidentally, they which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of Chance.

Should the style vary as the man writing the autobiography varies, or as the past man he writes about varied? Literary critics would declare that the style of a chapter should correspond to the man whose life is being dramatized: a quite rational injunction, one that ought therefore to be repeatedly disobeyed. The comic life portrayed by Hamlet, everyday kitchen events being described by Churchill, the man in love described by an Einstein. Thus it will have to be. Let us have no more quibbles about style. If style and subject matter happen to congeal in any of these chapters it is a lucky accident, not, we may hope, soon to be repeated.</p><p>A cunning chaos: that is what my autobiography shall be. I shall make my order chronological, an innovation dared these days by few. But my style shall be random, with the wisdom of the Die. I shall sulk and soar, extol and sneer.

I&#x2019;m six foot four and weigh close to two hundred and thirty pounds; I look a little like Clark Kent, except that when I take off my business suit I am barely faster than my wife, only slightly more powerful than men half my size, and leap buildings not at all, no matter how many leaps I&#x2019;m given.</p><p>As an athlete I am exceptionally mediocre in all major sports and in several minor ones. I play daring and disastrous poker and cautious and competent stock market. I married a pretty former cheerleader and rock-and-roll singer and have two lovely, nonneurotic and abnormal children. I am deeply religious, have written the lovely first-rate pornographic novel, The Dance of Maya, and am not now nor have I ever been Jewish.</p><p>I realize that it&#x2019;s your job as a reader to try to create a credible consistent pattern out of all this, but I&#x2019;m afraid I must add that I am normally atheistic, have given away at random thousands of dollars, have been a sporadic revolutionary against the governments of the United States, New York City, the Bronx and Scarsdale, and am still a card-carrying member of the Republican Party. I am the creator, as most of you know, of those nefarious Dice Centers for experiments in human behavior which have been described by the Journal of Abnormal Psychology as &#x201c;outrageous,&#x201d; &#x201c;unethical,&#x201d; and &#x201c;informative&#x201d;; by The New York Times as &#x201c;incredibly misguided and corrupt&#x201d;; by Time magazine as &#x201c;sewers&#x201d;; and by the Evergreen Review as &#x201c;brilliant and fun.&#x201d; I have been a devoted husband, multiple adulterer and experimental homosexual; an able, highly praised analyst, and the only one ever dismissed from both the Psychiatrists Association of New York (PANY) and from the American Medical Association (for &#x201c;ill-considered activities&#x201d; and &#x201c;probable incompetence&#x201d;). I am admired and praised by thousands of dicepeople throughout the nation but have twice been a patient in a mental institution, once been in jail, and am currently a fugitive, which I hope to remain, Die willing, at least until I have completed this 305-page autobiography.</p><p>My primary profession has been psychiatry. My passion, both as psychiatrist and as Dice Man, has been to change human personality. Mine. Others&#x2019;. Everyone&#x2019;s. To give to men a sense of freedom, exhilaration, joy. To restore to life the same shock of experience we have when bare toes first feel the earth at dawn and we see the sun split through the mountain trees like horizontal lightning; when a girl first lifts her lips to be kissed; when an idea suddenly springs full-blown into the mind, reorganizing in an instant the experience of a lifetime.</p><p>Life is islands of ecstasy in an ocean of ennui, and after the age of thirty land is seldom seen. At best we wander from one much-worn sandbar to the next, soon familiar with each grain of sand we see.</p><p>When I raised the &#x201c;problem&#x201d; with my colleagues, I was assured that the withering away of joy was as natural to normal man as the decaying of his flesh and based on much the same physiological changes. The purpose of psychology, they reminded me, was to decrease misery, increase productivity, relate the individual to his society, and help him to see and accept his self. Not to alter necessarily the habits, values and interests of the self, but to see them without idealization and to accept them as they are.</p><p>It had always seemed to me a quite obvious and desirable goal for therapy but, after having been &#x201c;successfully&#x201d; analyzed, and after having lived in moderate happiness with moderate success with an average wife and family for seven years, I found suddenly, around my thirty-second birthday, that I wanted to kill myself. And to kill several other people too.</p><p>I took long walks over the Queensborough Bridge and brooded down at the water. I reread Camus on suicide as the logical choice in an absurd world. On subway platforms I always stood three inches from the edge, and swayed. On Monday mornings I would stare at the bottle of strychnine on my cabinet shelf. I would daydream for hours of nuclear holocausts searing the streets of Manhattan clean, of steamrollers accidentally flattening my wife, of taxis taking my rival Dr. Ecstein off into the East River, of a teenage babysitter of ours shrieking in agony as I plowed away at her virgin soil.</p><p>Now the desire to kill oneself and to assassinate, poison, obliterate or rape others is generally considered in the psychiatric profession as &#x201c;unhealthy.&#x201d; Bad. Evil. More accurately, sin. When you have the desire to kill yourself, you are supposed to see and &#x201c;accept it,&#x201d; but not, for Christ&#x2019;s sake, to kill yourself. If you desire to have carnal knowledge of helpless preteeners, you are supposed to accept your lust, and not lay a finger on even her big toe. If you hate your father, fine&#x2014;but don&#x2019;t slug the bastard with a bat. Understand yourself, accept yourself, but do not be yourself.</p><p>It is a conservative doctrine, guaranteed to help the patient avoid violent, passionate and unusual acts and to permit him a prolonged, respectable life of moderate misery. In fact, it is a doctrine aimed at making everyone live like psychotherapists. The thought nauseated me.</p><p>These trivial insights actually began to form in the weeks following my first unexplained plunge into depression, a depression ostensibly produced by a long writing block on my &#x201c;book,&#x201d; but actually part of a general constipation of the soul that had been a long time building up. I remember sitting at my big oak desk after breakfast each morning before my first appointment reviewing my past accomplishments and future hopes with a feeling of scorn. I would take off my glasses and, reacting to both my thoughts and the surrealistic haze which became my visual world without my glasses, I would intone dramatically, &#x201c;Blind! Blind! Blind!&#x201d; and bang my boxing-glove-sized fist down on the desk with a dramatic crash.</p><p>I had been a brilliant student throughout my educational career, piling up academic honors like my son Larry collects bubble-gum baseball cards. While still in medical school I published my first article on therapy, a well-received trifle called &#x201c;The Physiology of Neurotic Tension.&#x201d; As I sat at my desk, all articles I had ever published seemed absolutely as good as other men&#x2019;s articles: blah. My successes with patients seemed identical to those of my colleagues: insignificant. The most I had come to hope for was to free a patient from anxiety and conflict: to alter him from a life of tormented stagnation to one of complacent stagnation. If my patients had untapped creativity or inventiveness or drive, my methods of analysis had failed to dig them out. Psychoanalysis seemed an expensive, slow-working, unreliable tranquilizer. If LSD were really to do what Alpert and Leary claimed for it, all psychiatrists would be out of jobs overnight. The thought pleased me.</p><p>In the midst of my cynicism I would occasionally daydream of the future. My hopes? To excel in all that I had been doing in the past: to write widely acclaimed articles and books; to raise my children so they might avoid the mistakes I had made; to meet some technicolor woman with whom I would become soulmate for life. Unfortunately, the thought that these dreams might all be fulfilled plunged me into despair.</p><p>I was caught in a bind. No matter how I twisted or turned there seemed to be an anchor in my chest which held me fast, the long line leaning out against the slant of sea taut and trim, as if it were cleated fast into the rock of the earth&#x2019;s vast core. It held me locked, and when a storm of boredom and bitterness blew in I would plunge and leap against the line&#x2019;s rough-clutching knot to be away, to fly before the wind, but the knot grew tight, the anchor only dug the deeper in my chest; I stayed. The burden of my self seemed inevitable and eternal.</p><p>However, after a few months of wallowing in depression (I furtively had purchased a .38 revolver and nine cartridges), Karen Horney led me to discover D. T. Suzuki, Alan Watts and Zen, and the world of the rat race, which I had assumed to be normal and healthy for an ambitious young man, seemed suddenly like the world of a rat race.</p><p>I was stunned and converted&#x2014;as only the utterly bored can be. Seeing drive, greed and intellectual aspiration as meaningless and sick in my colleagues, I was able to make the unusual generalization to myself; I too had the same symptoms of grasping after illusions. The secret, I seemed to learn, was in not caring, in accepting the limitations, conflicts and ambiguities of life with joy and satisfaction, in effortless drifting with the flow of impulse. So life was meaningless? Who cares. So my ambitions are trivial? Pursue them anyway. Life seems boring? Yawn.</p><p>I followed impulse. I drifted. I didn&#x2019;t care.</p><p>Unfortunately, life seemed to get more boring. Admittedly I was cheerfully, sometimes even gaily bored, where before I had been depressedly bored, but life remained essentially uninteresting. My mood of happy boredom was theoretically preferable to my desire to rape and kill, but personally speaking, not much. It was along about this stage of my somewhat sordid road to truth that I discovered the Dice Man.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>My life before D-Day was routine, humdrum, repetitious, trivial, compulsive, disordered, irritable&#x2014;the life of a typical successful married man. My new life began on a hot day in early July, 1968.</p><p>I awoke a little before seven, cuddled up to my wife Lillian, who was accordioned up into a Z in the bed beside me, and began pleasantly caressing her breasts, thighs and buttocks with my big gentle paws. I liked to begin the day this way: it set a standard by which to measure the gradual deterioration that succeeded from then on. After about four or five minutes we both rolled over and she began caressing me with her hands, and then with her lips, tongue and mouth.</p><p>&#x201c;Nnn morning, sweetheart,&#x201d; one of us would eventually say. </p><p>&#x201c;Nnnn,&#x201d; would say the other.</p><p>From that point on the day&#x2019;s dialogue would all be downhill, but with warm, languid hands and lips floating over the body&#x2019;s most sensitive surfaces, the world was as near perfection as it ever gets. Freud called it a state of ego-less polymorphous perversity and frowned upon it, but I have little doubt that he never had Lil&#x2019;s hands gliding over him. Or his own wife&#x2019;s either for that matter. Freud was a very great man, but I never get the impression that anyone ever effectively stroked his penis.</p><p>Lil and I were slowly advancing to the stage where play is replaced by passion when two, three, four thumps resounded from the hall, our bedroom door opened, and sixty pounds of boy-energy exploded onto our bed in a graceless...</p></p><h2>Hey Canada!</h2><p>Gran has decided that she is taking nine-year-old Alice and eight-year-old Cal on a road trip across Canada &#x201c;before she&#x2019;s old and creaky.&#x201d; With a sparkling combination of poems, silly songs, tweets and blogs, the trio records the trip for readers everywhere to share.

White owls who lived in some nearby trees never stopped hooting and flying around the palace, or so the story goes. No one slept a wink. Erith thought it was a sign that I was a remarkable child, and by the time I was old enough to hear the story, I liked to believe her. Remarkable or not, I was bathed and oiled and bandaged, as all babies are, and then they dressed me in a little shift and wrapped me in a rabbit skin to keep me warm. My mother and father showed their first baby to the ealdors, the elder statesmen, as was the custom, and then Erith cuddled me all night so that, as she said, I would not feel strange in this new country I had come to.<br><br>In my earliest memory I was toddling around on the big grassy enclosure at the center of the palace. Many grownups were walking about, men mostly, holding strange forked twigs in their hands. They moved slowly, eyes fixed on the ground, and they did not notice me or talk to me as they usually did. Because I was bored and wanted to copy them, I picked up a forked twig that someone had dropped and began to move toward the middle of the grass. Suddenly I screamed and screamed, so wildly and in such terror that everyone stopped and looked at me. What had happened was that the twig in my hand had turned into a snake. Well, it hadn't really. It was just an old twig, but while I had held it, all of a sudden it had started moving and wriggling in the most horrible way. My father came over to me.<br><br>"What happened?" he asked.<br><br>"It turned into a snake," I said, knowing that they would all laugh at me because there it was, just being a stick.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right," he said. "It wasn't really a snake. Would you do it again to show us?"<br><br>So rather nervously, but wanting to please, I picked up the twig again by its two handles, and almost at once it began to jerk downward as if it had a life of its own, and once again I dropped it with a yell. I thought my father would be cross with me, but he picked me up in his arms with a laugh.<br><br>"Well done, little girl. You've found us another supply of water. We thought there was one here somewhere, but no one could ever find it."<br><br>I suppose I should mention that my father was <i>regulus</i>, that is, a small chieftain or king, in Cornwall, and we lived at Castle Dore in the Wooden Palace that he had built on a high grassy place&#x2014;the site of an ancient fort. There was a house around a courtyard where my mother and father and I lived, a house for the astrologers and another for the bards, an armory, a bakery, quarters for the knights and ealdors, and a big hall where my father dined with them every evening. The house stood in the hills with a long view of farms and other hills, and the air sparkled with that special radiance of Cornish light.<br><br>My mother, Erlain, was a tall, graceful woman who was very clever. She could read and write and had learned mathematics and poetry. She could sing beautifully to the harp, and it was she, I heard tell, who brought the bards to our house and with them a very different atmosphere from the days when my father had lived alone with his knights. She taught him to read and write, and gradually, warrior though he was, he began to enjoy learning as much as she did. Later on, as a result, he wanted me to have the sort of good education that girls often do not have even now.<br><br>I should tell you that whenever a child was born to a knight or ealdor among my people, the astrologers studied the heavens and its charts to work out the portents for the child's life. Then they wrote some words, almost a sort of poem, to help the child remember the main points, and this was inscribed in tiny writing on parchment and put into a little horn case that was worn on a leather thong around the neck. Later on, when I was older and had learned to read, I liked to take the parchment out and read the words through, just to remind myself. They went like this:<br><br><i>Named for the strong and twisting tree<br>Of medicine, when she finds the way <br>By earth, air, water, fire <br>Then will she mend what is broken. <br>The dark teacher will correct her, <br>The fair one will protect her, <br>The strong man will love her, <br>And all may be well.<br><br></i>It didn&#x2019;t make much sense to me because after all, I was not named after a tree but was called by the good Cornish name of Ninnoc. The rest of the words seemed just as puzzling.<br><br>Other early memories are of a huge chamber at the Wooden Palace with a fire leaping and flickering in the hearth. I had a big bed and Erith had a little one in the corner, but because I felt lonely in my big bed I often jumped out of it and climbed in with Erith. Erith was young and pretty, with red hair and lots of freckles. I used to count them to tease her. Sometimes I woke her to make her tell me a story or sing me one of her Irish songs. I was quite bossy with Erith&#x2014;I behaved like a little princess who expects the servants to do as she tells them&#x2014;refusing to get dressed or have a bath or eat my dinner or whatever it was she had to get me to do. Once or twice she threatened to tell my father about my bad behavior, but she never did.<br><br>Sometimes my father would appear in my rooms in the evening, just at the time I should have been going to bed, and tell Erith to dress me in my prettiest gown. (I had some beautiful clothes made from pieces of gold and silver material like liquid flame left over from my mother's gowns. I was very proud of myself in them.) I had earrings and bracelets made of silver or set with gems, and on special occasions Erith hung jewels in my long black hair. Erith would put my little squirrel-skin slippers on me and comb my hair, and then I would walk with my father in the procession to the Great Hall. He would sit me on his lap and feed me tidbits from his plate. After dinner I would be passed around on the knees of the knights and they all would tease me and play with me. Once or twice I stood on the table and sang one of the songs my mother or Erith had taught me.<br><br>I enjoyed being spoiled, but I was disappointed that my mother did not have another baby who could have been a playmate for me. Only much later did I realize that my parents also wanted more children. But soon I acquired a new playmate whom I will tell you about later, and also Erith let me play with the children of some of the knights and ealdors. We played marvelous games. The old fort on which the palace had been built was surrounded by enormous ditches and ramparts constructed in a maze to make it hard for enemies to find the way in. We raced one another around the ditches, slid down the ramparts on wooden sleds, learned the mazes by heart, and had wonderful games of hide-and-seek there.</p><h2>Silver Canyon (The Louis L&#39;Amour collection)</h2><p>You&#39;re not wanted in Hattan&#39;s Point,&#34; Matt Brennan was told moments after arriving in town. &#34;There&#39;s trouble here and men are picking sides.&#34; But Matt decided he wasn&#39;t going anywhere.

Only the occasional tardy magician passed through, scarcely sparing a glance for the child waiting there.</p><p>Boy children of his type were not an uncommon sight in the Society&#x2019;s rooms.

Unlike the Society&#x2019;s splendidly liveried pages, he was soberly dressed, and he was young for a page boy, having just attained his sixth summer.</p><p>In fact, Zacharias held no particular employment, and he had never seen the Society before that morning, when he had been conducted there by the Sorcerer Royal himself. Sir Stephen had adjured him to wait, then vanished into the mysterious depths of the Great Hall.</p><p>Zacharias was awed by the stately building, with its sombre wood-panelled walls and imposing paintings, and he was a little frightened of the grave thaumaturges hurrying past in their midnight blue coats. Most of all he was rendered solemn by the seriousness of his task. He sat, swollen with purpose, gazing at the doors to the Great Hall, as though by an effort of will he might compel them to open and disgorge his guardian.</p><p>Finally, the moment came: the doors opened, and Sir Stephen beckoned to him.</p><p>Zacharias entered the Great Hall under the penetrating gaze of what seemed to be a thousand gentlemen, most of them old, and none friendly. Sir Stephen was the only person he knew, for one could not count Sir Stephen&#x2019;s familiar Leofric, who slept curled in reptilian coils at the back of the room, smoke rising from his snout.</p><p>The thickest-skinned child might have been cowed by such an assembly, and Zacharias was sensitive. But Sir Stephen put a reassuring hand on his back, and Zacharias remembered the morning, so long ago now&#x2014;home, safety, warmth, and Lady Wythe&#x2019;s face bending over him:</p><p>&#x201c;Never be afraid, Zacharias, but do your best. That will be quite enough, for you have been taught by the finest sorcerer in the realm. If the attention of so many gentlemen should make you nervous, simply pretend to yourself that they are so many heads of cabbages. That always assists me on such occasions.&#x201d;</p><p>Zacharias was pretending as hard as he could as he was propelled to the front of the room, but the cabbages did not seem to help. To be sure, Lady Wythe had never been called upon to prove the magical capacities of her race before the finest thaumaturgical minds in England. It was a grave responsibility, and one anyone would find daunting, thought Zacharias, even if he were a great boy of six.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you wish to bring alive, Zacharias?&#x201d; said Sir Stephen. He gestured at a small wooden box on a table. &#x201c;In the course of his travels Mr. Midsomer acquired this box, carved with birds and fruit and outlandish animals. You may have your pick.&#x201d;</p><p>Zacharias had rehearsed the enchantment he was to perform many times under Sir Stephen&#x2019;s patient tutelage. The night before, he had fallen asleep reciting the formula to himself. Yet now, as he was surrounded by a crowd of strange faces, oppressed by the consciousness of being the focus of their attention, memory deserted him.</p><p>His terrified gaze swung from Sir Stephen&#x2019;s kind face, skipped over the audience, and roamed over the Great Hall, as if he might find the words of the spell waiting for him in some dusty corner. It was the oldest room in the Society, and boasted several interesting features, chief of which were the ancient carved bosses on the ceiling. These represented lambs, lions and unicorns; faces of long-dead sorcerers; and Green Men with sour expressions and vines sprouting from their nostrils. At any other time they would have captivated Zacharias, but right now they could give him no pleasure.</p><p>&#x201c;I have forgotten the spell,&#x201d; he whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;What is that?&#x201d; said Sir Stephen. He had been speaking in clear ringing tones before, addressing his audience, but now he lowered his voice and leaned closer.</p><p>&#x201c;No helping the boy, if you please,&#x201d; cried a voice. &#x201c;That will prove nothing of what you promised.&#x201d;</p><p>The audience had been growing restless with Zacharias&#x2019;s stupefaction. Other voices followed the first, hectoring, displeased:</p><p>&#x201c;Is the child an idiot?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A poll parrot would offer better amusement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you conceive anything more absurd?&#x201d; said a thaumaturge to a friend, in a carrying whisper. &#x201c;He might as well seek to persuade us that a pig can fly&#x2014;or a woman do magic!&#x201d;</p><p>The friend observed that so <i>could</i> pigs fly, if one could be troubled to make them.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh certainly!&#x201d; replied the first. &#x201c;And one could teach a woman to do magic, I suppose, but what earthly good would a flying pig or a magical female be to anyone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is a great gift to the press,&#x201d; cried a gentleman with red whiskers and a supercilious expression. &#x201c;What fine material we have furnished today for the caricaturists&#x2014;a meeting of the first magicians of our age, summoned to watch a piccaninny stutter! Has English thaumaturgy indeed been so reduced by the waning of England&#x2019;s magic that Sir Stephen believes we have nothing better to do?&#x201d;</p><p>Unease rippled through the crowd, as though what the gentleman had said sat ill with his peers. Zacharias said anxiously: &#x201c;Perhaps there is not enough magic.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tush!&#x201d; said Sir Stephen. To Zacharias&#x2019;s embarrassment, he spoke loud enough for the entire room to hear. &#x201c;Pray do not let that worry you. It pleases Mr. Midsomer to enlarge upon the issue, but I believe England is still furnished with sufficient magic to quicken any tolerable magician&#x2019;s spells.&#x201d;</p><p>The red-whiskered gentleman shouted an indistinct riposte, but he was not allowed to finish, for three other thaumaturges spoke over him, disagreeing vociferously. Six more magicians took up Mr. Midsomer&#x2019;s defence, alternating insults to their peers with condemnation of Sir Stephen and mockery of his prot�g�. A poor sort of performing animal it was, they said, that would not perform!</p><p>&#x201c;What an edifying sight for a child&#x2014;a room full of men several times his size, calling him names,&#x201d; said one gentleman, who had the sorcerer&#x2019;s silver star pinned to his coat. He did not trouble to raise his voice, but his cool accents seemed to cut through the tumult. &#x201c;It is all of a piece with the most ancient traditions of our honourable Society, I am sure, and evidence of how well we deserve our position in the world.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Midsomer flushed with anger.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Damerell may say what he likes, but I see no reason why we should restrain our criticism of this absurd spectacle, child or no child,&#x201d; he snapped.</p><p>&#x201c;I am sure <i>you</i> do not, Midsomer,&#x201d; said Damerell gently. &#x201c;I have always admired your refusal, in the pursuit of your convictions, ever to be constrained by considerations of humanity&#x2014;much less of ordinary good manners.&#x201d;</p><p>The room erupted into more argument than ever. The clamour mounted till it seemed it must wake the carvings on the box, and even the slumbering bosses on the ceiling, without Zacharias&#x2019;s needing to lift a finger.</p><p>Zacharias looked around, but everyone had ceased to pay attention to him. For the moment he was reprieved.</p><p>He let out a small sigh of relief. As if that tiny breath were the key to his locked memory, his mind opened, and the spell fell into it, fully formed. The words were so clear and obvious, their logic so immaculate, that Zacharias wondered that he had ever lost them.</p><p>He spoke the spell under his breath, still a little uncertain after the agonies he had endured. But magic came, ever his friend&#x2014;magic answered his call. The birds carved upon the box blushed red, green, blue and yellow, and he knew that the spell had caught.</p><p>The birds peeled away from the box as they took on substance and being, their wings springing away from their bodies, feathers sprouting upon their flesh. They flew up to the ceiling, squawking. The breeze from their wings brushed Zacharias&#x2019;s face, and he laughed.</p><p>One by one the carved bosses sprang to life, and the dead sorcerers and the sour old Green Men and the lions and the lambs and the birds opened their mouths, all of them singing, singing lustily Zacharias&#x2019;s favourite song, drowning out the angry voices of the men below, and filling the room with glorious sound.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>Eighteen years later</p><p>LADY FRANCES BURROW&#x2019;S guests had not noticed her butler particularly when he showed them into the house, but the self-important flourish with which he now flung open the door piqued curiosity. Those who broke off conversations, and raised their head from their ices, were duly rewarded by his announcement:</p><p>&#x201c;Lady Maria Wythe and Mr. Zacharias Wythe!&#x201d;</p><p>It had not been three months since Zacharias Wythe had taken up the staff of the Sorcerer Royal&#x2014;not so long since his predecessor, Sir Stephen Wythe, had died. He was an object of general interest, and to the great increase of Lady Frances&#x2019;s complacency, more than one pair of eyes followed his progress around her drawing room.</p><p>Zacharias Wythe could not fail to draw attention wherever he went. The dark hue of his skin would mark him out among any assembly of his colleagues, but he was also remarkable for his height, and the handsomeness of his features, which was not impaired by his rather melancholy expression. Perhaps the last was not surprising in one who had entered into his office in such tragic circumstances, and at a time when the affairs of English thaumaturgy were approaching an unprecedented crisis.</p><p>Stranger than his colour, however, and more distressing than any other circumstance was the fact that Zacharias Wythe had no familiar, though he bore the Sorcerer Royal&#x2019;s ancient staff. Lady Frances&#x2019;s guests did not hesitate to tell each other what they thought of this curious absence, but they spoke in hushed voices&#x2014;less in deference to the black crepe band around Zacharias&#x2019;s arm than out of respect for his companion.</p><p>It was Lady Wythe whom Lady Frances had invited, overbearing her protests with generous insistence:</p><p>&#x201c;It is hardly a party! Only one&#x2019;s most intimate friends! You must take it in the light of a prescription, dear Maria. It cannot be good for you to mope about at home. Mr. Wythe, too, ought not to be left too much to himself, I am sure.&#x201d;</p><p>In Zacharias, Lady Frances had hit upon the chief remaining object of Lady Wythe&#x2019;s anxiety and affection. Lady Wythe&#x2019;s bereavement was great, and she had never been fond of society even before Sir Stephen&#x2019;s death. But for Zacharias she would do a great deal, and for his sake she essayed forth in her black bombazine, to do battle in a world turned incalculably colder and drearier by her husband&#x2019;s departure.</p><p>&#x201c;I wonder what Lord Burrow is about?&#x201d; she said to Zacharias. &#x201c;It cannot do any harm to ask him about your spells to arrest the decline in our magic. Sir Stephen said Lord Burrow had as good an understanding of the science of thaumaturgy as any man he knew.&#x201d;</p><p>It had formed no small part of Lady Wythe&#x2019;s desire to attend the party that Lord Burrow chaired the Presiding Committee that governed the Royal Society of Unnatural Philosophers. Lord Burrow had been a friend to Sir Stephen, but he had regarded Sir Stephen&#x2019;s scheme to educate a negro boy in magic as an unfortunate freak&#x2014;an eccentricity only tolerable in a man of his great parts. The turn that had bestowed the staff of the Sorcerer Royal on that negro boy was not, in Lord Burrow&#x2019;s view, one to be welcomed. He was learned enough not to ascribe Britain&#x2019;s imminent crisis of magical resource either to Zacharias&#x2019;s complexion or to his inexperience, but that did not mean he looked upon Zacharias himself with any warmth.</p><p>His support would do a great deal to bolster Zacharias&#x2019;s position, however, if it could be got. It was with this thought in mind that Lady Wythe had chivvied Zacharias along, for Zacharias was as disinclined for society as Lady Wythe could be. Though he had, at four and twenty, all the ease and assurance that could be imparted by a capital education and a lifetime&#x2019;s intercourse with the good and great of the magical world, by nature he was rather retiring than sociable, and his manners were impaired by reserve.</p><p>He had agreed to accompany Lady Wythe because he believed society might enliven her spirits, but he balked at her directive to make up to Lord Burrow:</p><p>&#x201c;Like as not he will think it an absurd impertinence in me to presume to have identified a solution for our difficulties, when so many better magicians than I have failed. Besides, my researches had hardly advanced in any degree before they were suspended.&#x201d;</p><p>Before Sir Stephen&#x2019;s death and Zacharias&#x2019;s subsequent elevation, Zacharias had devoted the bulk of his time to the pursuit of thaumaturgical inquiries. He had surveyed the household magics clandestinely transacted by females of the labouring classes, to which the Society turned a blind eye; he had studied the magics of other nations, producing a monograph on the common structures of African and Asiatic enchantments; but in the period preceding Sir Stephen&#x2019;s death, he had been chiefly engaged in the devising of spells to reverse the ongoing decline of England&#x2019;s magic.</p><p>It was a project of considerable practical interest, but Zacharias had not so much as looked at it in several months. For Zacharias, as for Lady Wythe, Sir Stephen&#x2019;s death was the point at which the ordinary course of time had been halted. What ensued after that date had been life of quite a different kind, scarcely connected with what had gone before.</p><p>&#x201c;I should not like to show my spells to anyone, in their current state,&#x201d; said Zacharias now.</p><p>Lady Wythe was too wise to press the point. &#x201c;Well then, perhaps we ought to see to your being introduced to some of the young ladies here. Lady Frances said they might get up a dance after dinner. There cannot be any objection to your joining in, and it would be a pity if any young lady were compelled to sit out a dance for want of a partner.&#x201d;</p><p>Zacharias&#x2019;s look of consternation was comical. &#x201c;I scarcely think they will be pleased to be offered such a partner. You forget in your partiality what a very alarming object I am.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nonsense!&#x201d; cried Lady Wythe. &#x201c;You are precisely the kind of creature girls like best to swoon over. Dark, mysterious, quiet&#x2014;for a young man who talks a great deal always seems a coxcomb. The very image of romance! Think of Othello.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His romance came to no good end,&#x201d; said Zacharias.</p><p>It seemed he was in the right of it, for it soon became evident that Zacharias was having a curious effect upon the other guests. Whispered discussions were hushed suddenly as he passed. Thaumaturges who might be expected to greet the head of their profession nodded to Lady Wythe, but averted their eyes from Zacharias.</p><p>Zacharias was not unaccustomed to such treatment; if it troubled him, he had no intention of letting Lady Wythe know it. Lady Wythe was not so hardened, however. Though the other guests&#x2019; withdrawal was scarcely overt, her powers of observation were sharpened by affection, and what she saw wounded her.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I credit my eyes?&#x201d; she said in a low voice. &#x201c;Did I see Josiah Cullip cut you?&#x201d;</p><p>Zacharias said, in a dishonourable fit of cowardice, &#x201c;Perhaps he did not see me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Zacharias, my dear, I do ...</p></p><h2>The Hobbit, Or There and Back Again, Text by J.R.R. Tolkien and Illustrations from the Film by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass</h2><p><b>THE GREATEST FANTASY EPIC OF OUR TIME<br><br></b>Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit who wanted to be left alone in quiet comfort. But the wizard Gandalf came along with a band of homeless dwarves. Soon Bilbo was drawn into their quest, facing evil orcs, savage wolves, giant spiders, and worse unknown dangers. Finally, it was Bilbo&#x2013;alone and unaided&#x2013;who had to confront the great dragon Smaug, the terror of an entire countryside . . .<br><br><b>This stirring adventure fantasy begins the tale of the hobbits that was continued by J.R.R. Tolkien in his bestselling epic <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.<br></b><br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p><i>"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."</i> <p> The hobbit-hole in question belongs to one Bilbo Baggins, an upstanding member of a "little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves." He is, like most of his kind, well off, well fed, and best pleased when sitting by his own fire with a pipe, a glass of good beer, and a meal to look forward to. Certainly this particular hobbit is the last person one would expect to see set off on a hazardous journey; indeed, when Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, "looking for someone to share in an adventure," Baggins fervently wishes the wizard elsewhere. No such luck, however; soon 13 fortune-seeking dwarves have arrived on the hobbit's doorstep in search of a burglar, and before he can even grab his hat or an umbrella, Bilbo Baggins is swept out his door and into a dangerous adventure.</p><p> The dwarves' goal is to return to their ancestral home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they and their reluctant companion meet giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves--and, most perilous of all, a subterranean creature named Gollum from whom Bilbo wins a magical ring in a riddling contest. It is from this life-or-death game in the dark that J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, would eventually spring. Though <i>The Hobbit</i> is lighter in tone than the trilogy that follows, it has, like Bilbo Baggins himself, unexpected iron at its core. Don't be fooled by its fairy-tale demeanor; this is very much a story for adults, though older children will enjoy it, too. By the time Bilbo returns to his comfortable hobbit-hole, he is a different person altogether, well primed for the bigger adventures to come--and so is the reader. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt paperbackISBN&nbsp;978-0-618-26030-0</p><h2>The Bad Seed</h2><p><p>Now reissued &#x2013; William March's 1954 classic thriller that's as chilling, intelligent and timely as ever before. This paperback reissue includes a new P.S. section with author interviews, insights, features, suggested reading and more. </p><p> What happens to ordinary families into whose midst a child serial killer is born? This is the question at the center of William march's classic thriller. After its initial publication in 1954, the book went on to become a million&#x2013;copy bestseller, a wildly successful Broadway show, and a Warner Brothers film. The spine&#x2013;tingling tale of little Rhoda Penmark had a tremendous impact on the thriller genre and generated a whole perdurable crop of creepy kids. Today, <em>The Bad Seed</em> remains a masterpiece of suspense that's as chilling, intelligent, and timely as ever before. </p></p><p><p>William March (1893-1954) was born in Mobile, Alabama, attended Valparaiso University in Indiana, and studied law at the University of Alabama. He served in the Marine Corps during World War I and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Navy Cross, and the Croix de Guerre with Palm. After the war, he took a job with the Waterman Steamship Corporation, and worked there for eighteen years before giving up his position to devote himself to writing. March published three volumes of stories and six novels, including <em>The Bad Seed</em>, his final book.</p><p><b>Foreword</b><br><br> by Anna Holmes&nbsp;<br><br> I suppose if a novelist is going to imagine and give life to a character meant to be a memorable but also totally unexpected serial killer, it makes sense that he make her not only a young child but also a girl. Though readers may be more familiar with Macaulay Culkin&#x2019;s apple-cheeked child psycho in 1993&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Good Son</i>, the grade-school sociopath to which all contemporary child killers can, and should, be compared is Rhoda Penmark, the focus of William March&#x2019;s 1954 bestselling novel,&nbsp;<i>The Bad Seed</i>. Eight years old, with straight brown hair and a desire for tidiness that seems to border on the obsessive, Rhoda boasts an old-fashioned name and a stereotypically feminine, highly controlled style of dress and disposition that seem to be at extreme odds with her willingness to, for example, toss terrier puppies to their deaths from bedroom windows. And she&#x2019;s driving her mother, the overly cautious housewife Christine Penmark, literally crazy.&nbsp;<br><br> Of course, it&#x2019;s not just animals who invoke the wrath of Rhoda P., Kid Creep: Children and adults alike are subject to her special form of homicidal dispensation, giving lie to the nineteenth century nursery rhyme that little girls are made of &#x201c;sugar and spice and everything nice.&#x201d; Indeed, it&#x2019;s likely that part of what made&nbsp;<i>The Bad Seed</i>&nbsp;so terrifying and unsettling to midcentury American readers is author William March&#x2019;s juxtaposition of the younger Penmark&#x2019;s external performance of obedient, coquettish femininity&#x2014;&#x201c;Oh, my old-fashioned little darling!&#x201d; exclaims one of Rhoda&#x2019;s admirers, her neighbor Monica Breedlove, early on in the text&#x2014;with what are commonly thought to be more masculine traits: the covetousness, ruthlessness, and lack of control that inspire most of her calculated crimes of convenience. This dissonance between how Rhoda appears on the outside and who she is on the inside is further underscored by her aforementioned appearance, all pressed dotted-Swiss dresses and trimmed bangs and perfectly twisted pigtails.&nbsp;<br><br> About those pigtails. In the film version of the book, released in 1956, Mr. March&#x2019;s Rhoda, she of the &#x201c;straight, finespun, and...dark, dull brown&#x201d; hair, is reimagined as a towheaded terror in the form of actress Patty McCormack, who received an Academy Award nomination for her performance. Director Mervyn LeRoy&#x2019;s choice to take a page from Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s playbook and make the celluloid Rhoda a blonde served to accentuate not just the character&#x2019;s iciness but to communicate a certain innocence and fragility, making her appear more like a doll than a flesh-and-blood human being. Indeed, the film version feels prescient in the ways that it seems to presage and anticipate any number of scary killer dolls from cinematic history, including the braided moppets from the 1963&nbsp;<i>Twilight Zone</i>&nbsp;episode &#x201c;Living Doll&#x201d; and 2013&#x2019;s paranormal thriller&nbsp;<i>The Conjuring</i>. Descriptions of Rhoda&#x2019;s appearance and countenance in the book reinforce this: She walks stiffly and somewhat carefully; her hair is arranged in the sort of perfectly ordered, taut plaits that only a factory assembly line could produce; and she seems to be capable of two, maybe three expressions&#x2014;blank solemnity, irresistible cuteness, and flashing anger.&nbsp;<br><br> Though not exactly a character study, it&#x2019;s possible that William March&#x2019;s criminalizing of a young female was supposed to be both provocative and maybe even political, that in making an adorable little girl an ice-cold killer somehow our ideas of femininity and decorum and preciousness were going to be upended, and violently. (It was the mid-1950s, after all, a time in which expectations for womanhood and the cultivation of comfortable, safe domestic arrangements were at an all-time high, expectations that came under fire in Betty Friedan&#x2019;s seminal&nbsp;<i>The Feminine Mystique</i>, published less than a decade later.) It&#x2019;s unlikely, however, that the film would have the same deleterious effect on the contemporary reading or theater-going public, as familiar with and desensitized as it is to the concept of the multiple murderess. (This might explain why, when Hostel director Eli Roth considered doing a remake of&nbsp;<i>The Bad Seed</i>, he made it clear that he wanted lots of blood and gore&#x2014;there isn&#x2019;t any in either the film or the book&#x2014;explaining to interviewers that he thought Rhoda deserved the sort of horror icon status enjoyed by the character Chucky from&nbsp;<i>Child&#x2019;s Play</i>, an actual killer doll. &#x201c;We are going to bastardize and exploit it, ramping up the body counts and killings,&#x201d; he told<i>Variety</i>&nbsp;in 2004.)&nbsp;<br><br> But reading&nbsp;<i>The Bad Seed</i>, one eventually gets the sense that Mr. March is not so much celebrating expressions of female power and agency as fearing them; his contempt for the other female characters he&#x2019;s created is palpable. (The men in the book are, for the most part, emasculated, impotent, or completely invisible.) There is Hortense Daigle, the drunk, hysterical, and smothering mother of one of Rhoda&#x2019;s young victims, Claude Daigle; Mrs. Breedlove, a busybody neighbor who prides herself on her understanding of human behavior yet remains blind to the psychological monstrosity standing in front of her; and, of course, the anxious, selfless Christine Penmark, the person considered responsible for her daughter&#x2019;s misdeeds&#x2014;Christine&#x2019;s own &nbsp;mother was a psycho killer, March explains, meaning that the evil is matrilineal&#x2014;and seemingly unable to stop them.<br><br> This is where Mr. March&#x2019;s book is most problematic. The esteemed feminist and literary critic Elaine Showalter, in an introduction to a 1997 HarperCollins edition of the book, explains that &#x201c;as in much of March&#x2019;s writing, women in&nbsp;<i>The Bad Seed</i>&nbsp;are more sinister than men,&#x201d; and though she swats him for the book&#x2019;s implicit message that at the root of much conflict and societal upheaval are &#x201c;castrating wives and mothers,&#x201d; Showalter does not go far enough in indicting him for these and other hoary tropes he traffics in, including but not limited to the clueless gossip; the prim, status-obsessed educator; and of course, Rhoda herself, a femme fatale who becomes the object of affection even to those who ought to fear her most. &#x201c;In a sense, he was in love with the little girl,&#x201d; writes Mr. March about Leroy Jessup, an apartment-building janitor whom Rhoda will eventually burn to death in a highly disturbing scene during the book&#x2019;s denouement. &#x201c;His persecution of her, his nagging concern with everything she did, was part of a perverse and frightened courtship.&#x201d; As Showalter herself puts it, one could say the same about the relationship between the author of&nbsp;<i>The Bad Seed</i>&nbsp;himself and the grotesque version of femininity he imagined and then committed to paper.&nbsp;<br><br> It probably says something about the evolution in attitudes about gender and girlhood&#x2014;not to mention mental illness and sociopathy&#x2014;that William March&#x2019;s book would be unlikely to have the same chilling or shocking effect were it published for the first time today. For one thing, our ideas about good and evil have been complicated and expanded upon thanks to advances in the fields of psychology and criminology, not to mention child development. For another, broadened expectations for women and girls mean that, for better or worse, we are seen as more fully realized human beings, not cartoonish ciphers that either adhere to or reject conventional ideas about what females are capable of. If there&#x2019;s anything in&nbsp;<i>The Bad Seed</i>&nbsp;that resonates strongly today, it&#x2019;s the ways in which acts of violence are celebrated as legitimate responses to thwarted entitlement. But that&#x2019;s part of the problem with America, not with its boys (or girls)<br> &nbsp;<br><b> One</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Later that summer, when Mrs. Penmark looked back and remembered, when she was caught up in despair so deep that she knew there was no way out, no solution whatever for the circumstances that encompassed her, it seemed to her that June seventh, the day of the Fern Grammar School picnic, was the day of her last happiness, for never since then had she known contentment or felt peace.&nbsp;<br><br> The picnic was an annual, traditional affair held on the beach and among the oaks of Benedict, the old Fern summer place at Pelican Bay. It was here that the impeccable Fern sisters had been born and had lived through their languid, eventless summers. They had refused to sell the old place, and had kept it up faithfully as a gesture of love even when necessity made them turn their town house into a school for the children of their friends. The picnic was always held on the first Saturday of June since the eldest of the three sisters, Miss Octavia, was convinced, despite the occasions on which it had rained that particular day, and the picnic had to be held inside after all, that the first Saturday of June was an invariably fine one.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;When I was a little girl, as young as many of you are today,&#x201d; she would say each season to her pupils, &#x201c;we always planned a picnic at Benedict for the first Saturday of June. All our relatives and friends came&#x2014;some of whom we&#x2019;d not seen for months. It was sort of a reunion, really, with laughter and surprises and gentle, excited voices everywhere. Everyone had a happy, beautiful day. There was no dissension on those days; a quarrel was unknown in the society of the well-bred, a cross word never exchanged between ladies and gentlemen. My sisters and I remember those days with love and great longing.&#x201d;<br><br> At this point Miss Burgess Fern, the middle sister, the practical one who handled the business affairs of the school, said, &#x201c;It was so much easier in those days, with a houseful of servants and everybody helpful and anxious to please. Mother and some of the servants would drive down to Benedict a few days in advance of the picnic, sometimes as early as the first of June, when the season was officially open, although the established residents of the coast didn&#x2019;t consider the season really in swing until the day of our picnic.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Benedict is such a beautiful spot,&#x201d; said Miss Claudia Fern. &#x201c;Little Lost River bounds our property on the Gulf side, and flows into the bay there.&#x201d; Miss Claudia taught art in the school, and automatically she added, &#x201c;The landscape at that point reminds one so much of those charming river scenes by Bombois.&#x201d; Then, feeling that some of her pupils might not know who Bombois was, she went on. &#x201c;For the sake of some of the younger groups, Bombois is a modern French primitive. Oh, he is so cunning in his artlessness! So right in his composition, and in the handling of green! You&#x2019;ll learn much about Bombois later on.&#x201d;<br><br> It was from the Fern town house, the school itself, that the picnickers were to begin their long day of pleasure; and the parents of each pupil had been asked to have their particular child on the school lawn not later than eight o&#x2019;clock, when the chartered busses were scheduled to leave. Thus it was that Mrs. Christine Penmark, who disliked being late or keeping others waiting, set her clock for six, which, she felt, would allow time for her ordinary tasks of the morning and for the remembrance of those last-minute, hurried things which are so easily overlooked.&nbsp;<br><br> She had impressed the hour on her mind, saying to herself as she fell asleep, &#x201c;You will awake precisely at six o&#x2019;clock, even if something happens to the alarm&#x201d;; but the alarm went off promptly, and, yawning a little, she sat up in bd. It was, she saw instantly, to be a beautiful day&#x2014;the day Miss Octavia had promised. She pushed back her blond, almost flaxen, hair and went at once to the bathroom, staring at herself in the mirror for a long moment, her toothbrush held languidly in her hand, as though she were not quite decided what to do with it. Her eyes were gray, wide-set, and serene; her skin tanned and firm. She drew back her lips in that first tentative, trial smile of the day; and standing thus in front of her mirror, she listened absently to the sounds outside her window: an automobile starting in the distance, the twittering of sparrows in the live oaks that lined the quiet street, the sound of a child&#x2019;s voice raised suddenly and then hushed. Then, coming awake quickly, in possession once more of her usual energy, she bathed and dressed and went to her kitchen to begin breakfast.&nbsp;<br><br> Later she went to her daughter&#x2019;s room to waken her. The room was empty, and it was so tidy that it gave the impression not having been used for a long time. The bed was nearly remade, the dressing-table immaculate, with each object in its accustomed place, turned at its usual angle. On a table near the window was one of the jigsaw puzzles that her daughter delighted in, a puzzle only half completed. Mrs. Penmark smiled to herself and went into the child&#x2019;s bathroom. The bathroom was as orderly as the bedroom had been, with the bath towel spread out precisely to dry; and Christine, seeing these things laughed softly, thinking: I never deserved such a capable child. When I was eight years old, I doubt if I could do anything. She went into the wide, elaborate hall with its elegant, old-fashioned parquetry floors of contrasting woods, and called gaily, &#x201c;Rhoda! Rhoda! . . . Where are you, darling? Are you up and dressed so soon?&#x201d;<br><br> The child answered in her slow, cautions voice, as though the speaking of words were a perilous thing to be debated. &#x201c;Here I am,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Here, in the living-room.&#x201d;<br><br> When speaking of her daughter, the adjectives that others most often used were &#x201c;quaint,&#x201d; or &#x201c;modest,&#x201d; or &#x201c;old-fashioned&#x201d;; and Mrs. Penmark, standing in the doorway, smiled in agreement and wondered from what source the child had inherited her repose, her neatness, her cool self-sufficiency. She said, coming into the room, &#x201c;Were you really able to comb and plait your hair without my helping you?&#x201d;<br><br> The child half turned, so that her mother could inspect her hair, which was straight, finespun, and of a dark, dull brown: her hair was plaited precisely in two narrow braids which were looped back into two thin hangman-nooses, and were secured, in turn, with two small bows of ribbon. Mrs. Penmark examined the bows, but seeing they were compact and firmly tied, she brushed her lips over the child&#x2019;s brown bangs, and said, &#x201c;Breakfast will be ready in a moment. I think you&#x2019;d better eat a good breakfast today as there&#x2019;s nothing more uncertain about a picnic than the arrival of lunch.&#x201d;<br><br> Rhoda sat down at the table, her face fixed in an expression of solemn innocence; then she smiled at some secret thought of her own, and at once there was a shallow dimple in her left cheek. She lowered her chin and raised it thoughtfully; she smiled again, but very softly, an odd, hesitant smile that parted her lips this time and showed the small, natural gap between her front teeth.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Worldwide Sourdoughs from Your Bread Machine (Nitty Gritty Cookbooks)</h2><p>Authentic sourdough recipes from the bread machine begin with natural wild yeast; recipes include hand-shaped sourdoughs from the dough cycle.</p><p></p><h2>Outlaws and Lawmen of the West</h2><p>In the Old West, the law was fragile, the men were armed, tempers were short, and socializing took place over shots of rotgut whiskey on a card table in a saloon.

William Butler Yeats' writing captures all the magic and mystery of his native Ireland, and here are some 26 of his finest, most mesmerizing verses. In "The Stolen Child," fairies come in the night to entice a boy away forever to "where the wave of moonlight glosses the dim grey sands with light." Yeats claimed that a Greek folk song inspired "The Song of Wandering Aengus": the excerpt here follows Aengus on his quest to locate an enchanted girl. Visions of a fierce and terrible battle-where "unknown perishing armies beat about my ears"--emerge in "The Valley of the Black Pig," all seen in a dream. Matching the beauty of Yeats' written images are a series of exquisite and evocative paintings, which range from panoramic natural landscapes to compelling portraits of characters both human and fantastic. And, as always, this acclaimed series features fascinating biographical information, introductions to each verse, and full annotations that define difficult unfamiliar vocabulary.<br></p><p>Reviewed with books on Coleridge and Wordsworth in the Poetry for Young People series.<p>Gr. 6-10. The editors of these handsome collections in the Poetry for Young People series have chosen well, bringing together about 20 of each great poet's most accessible, compelling poems, with selections that range from Coleridge's "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" to Wordsworth's "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud" and Yeats' stark, dramatic "An Irish Airman Foresees His Death." The full-color paintings on each page are beautiful. Each volume begins with a helpful general biography and a critical introduction to the poet's work. On the page with each poem, brief editorial notes provide useful context and guidance (if only the notes were at the back of the book, so that the reader could first enjoy a poem free of commentary). In fact, the book design is a problem, especially in the Yeats book. Harrington's impressionistic art is lush and beautiful, evoking the Irish landscapes, fantasy worlds, and stormy emotions of the verse; but the large pictures leave no space for readers to imagine what the words suggest, and much of the type is hard to read because it's printed right on the dark, full-page paintings. In the Coleridge and Wordsworth collections there is a lot more white space, and the illustrations evoke each poet's world without totally overwhelming the verbal images. None of this classic poetry is easy reading, and all three books will work best for reading aloud and group discussion. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Born in Dublin, the son of a gifted professional family, he trained as a lawyer and also gained fame as a painter, a theatrical manager, and political figure. This collection reveals the poet's love for the landscapes and people of Ireland, especially of County Sligo. Strong themes of Celtic mysticism and the occult appear in several selections. Each poem is prefaced by a few lines that set the scene and is followed by an explanation of difficult words.

If you think I&#x2019;m kidding, just watch the six o&#x2019;clock news. The first twenty-nine minutes are all about dictators and murderers and terrorists and maniacs and, worst of all, <i>real housewives</i>. And then, at the very end of the show, there&#x2019;s a thirty second human-interest story about some schmuck who married his cat. I rest my case.</p><p>Some things I&#x2019;ve hated forever, some are new acquisitions, and some are just passing fancies. Today I hate happy TV weathermen, feminists who believe Gloria Steinem&#x2019;s great looks hurt her, Gloria Steinem herself, people who mispronounce the word <i>ask</i>, studio apartments, guidance counselors, first ladies, old people. So if any of this offends you, or you happen to love puppies and kittens and the infirm . . . well . . . I&#x2019;m impressed.

So when I say <i>hat</i>e, I don&#x2019;t necessarily mean <i>hate</i>. I could also mean loathe, detest, abhor, dislike, despise or resent. See, isn&#x2019;t that kinder and gentler? If you think this makes you a better person than I am, good.

I&#x2019;m fed up with the morons and losers and cretins who are cluttering up the planet. Emma Lazarus wrote, &#x201c;Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t know she meant on my block. But being fed up and angry is better than being depressed. Psychologists tell us that depression is just anger turned inward, but I say, why waste your time? It is what it is and quite frankly I&#x2019;d rather be angry than depressed. Why? Because antidepressants like Prozac, Wellbutrin and Zoloft can cause bloating&#x2014;and I hate bloating!!!

The contents encompass nearly 200 years of opera history, from Gluck's 18th-century Orpheus and Eurydice, featuring an unexpectedly happy ending, to Benjamin Britten's pathos-laden The Little Sweep, with selections ranging from somber (Wagner's Flying Dutchman) to giddy (Rimski-Korsakov's Christmas Eve) in between. Husain brightens her plot summaries with flashes of humorthe usually-grim Furies respond to Orpheus's pleas by ``smiling rather rustily,'' while Gretel greets the Crunch Witch's talk of boy soup and stew with ``That's disgusting''and tucks in occasional snatches of lyric or references to singing to remind readers that opera is a musical genre. Mayhew introduces characters and catches each story's high spots with tableaux and individual portraits of gorgeously costumed figures. This is pleasant preparatory reading for a night at the opera, although it is skimpy next to The Random House Book of Opera Stories (1998, not reviewed) or other heftier guides.

Crosbie relates background information and the voyage's events with a trite combination of sound-bite captions surrounding a fictive young survivor's journal entries, all supported by several foldout sheets or booklets printed in a tiny, marginally legible typeface. The often-fragile movable effects range from ho-hum to, in the case of a circular view of the Atlantic Ocean and coastlines that pivots around its center, downright surreal. The design is so slipshod that the unfinished art beneath the pop-up collision scene is plainly visible. For no evident reason, a number of the painted illustrations are printed on separate pieces, then glued to the page. A final spread on the wreck's present and future isn't enough to keep this offering afloat, especially considering the plethora of better treatments; Ken Marschall's <i>Inside the</i> Titanic<i>: A Giant Cut-away Book</i> (Little, Brown, 1997), for instance, is both more informative and has a higher "wow" factor.&#x2014;<i>John Peters, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster may be but a speck on the iceberg-studded horizon, but children's macabre fascination with the Titanic saga endures. This latest title on the tragedy is done up in the oversize, feature-loaded fashion popularized by Candlewick's Dragonology (2003) and others. Based on the packaging&#x2014;copious silver foil and a portal framing an image that changes with the book's angle&#x2014;one might assume it to be the most lavish such book yet. In practice, though, the flaps, booklets, and other extras feel a bit uninspired, even illogically applied (at one point, a map of the globe swivels around the wrong axis). But a dimensional, stem-to-stern portrait of the steamship will impress readers, and the content is solid enough, delivered through a combination of historical sidebars and fictional journal entries that chart the experiences of a boy passenger who loses two family members in the disaster. Illustrations include original watercolors and archival images. Purchase this for the book's outward splendor and the seemingly depthless demand for material on the topic.

The sun was sinking into <br><br>the Mediterranean, as if it were bleeding crimson into the water. The light was fading quickly. The air was already cooler, but it was mid-�December. Even here in Jaffa, on the coast of Palestine, the winters were cold.<br><br>Still smiling, she pulled her shawl around her shoulders. This journey to Jerusalem was the most cherished Christmas gift she had ever been given. She knew all the great cities of Europe, but she had never come farther east. Was it her imagination that this land was so very different from the places she knew? How much is any place seen through the lens of one&#x2019;s imagination, colored by the dreams one has of it and of the events that have happened there?<br><br>In Paris, does one hear the laughter and music, and see the ghosts of the Revolution and the Terror?

And yet she wanted to watch the sky darken until there was only the blaze of stars to see.<br><br>Vespasia had known Victor Narraway for many years in connection with Thomas Pitt and the cases he had solved, and in which they had assisted one way or another, but in spite of her silver hair and the refinement of many years in her face, this year of 1900 was only the second of their marriage. Narraway&#x2019;s gift of a journey to Jerusalem had surprised her. There was a spiritual resonance to it she would not have expected from him. She knew his ethical beliefs very well. She could not have married a man whose driving forces she did not know, but he had never framed them in terms of religion. But then perhaps she had not either. One could kneel in church among scores of people who used the same words as you did, many long familiar, and yet the meanings they each took from them were probably worlds apart.<br><br>There was so much to discover, even in those you knew best. She hoped it would always be so. One should be growing, changing, learning forever. Ideas in the mind were like blood in the veins. The heart that does not beat is dying.<br><br>She heard movement behind her and turned.<br><br>Narraway was standing in the middle of the room, smiling.

If I take a cloak, we could go for a walk. Perhaps toward the sea? It&#x2019;s only half a mile or so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said a trifle too quickly. &#x201c;It would be unwise to walk in the streets after dark.&#x201d; A flicker of concern crossed his face. &#x201c;In fact, it might be better not to go toward the dockside even in daylight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know there&#x2019;s unrest,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;But isn&#x2019;t that a little . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, it isn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he answered, his face somber. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s always unease in Palestine, but this time of the year it&#x2019;s worse. Thousands of Christian pilgrims come here on their way to Jerusalem, or Bethlehem. Jews come to the Western Wall, and Muslims to the Dome of the Rock. Feelings are high.&#x201d; He gave a slight shrug, just the lifting of one shoulder. &#x201c;God knows, too often we have little respect for one another&#x2019;s religions or customs, especially if they conflict with our own, and we don&#x2019;t understand them. We don&#x2019;t even try to.&#x201d;<br><br>She heard the sharpness in his voice, and might have mistaken it for temper had she not known the depth of his knowledge. In all the experiences they had shared, very often in connection with matters of importance and danger, she had never seen his nerve fail him. Once he had been head of Special Branch, that arm of the police service responsible for the detection of treason and threats to the safety of the state from within, as opposed to those who defend from armed attack by other nations. In all her long and frequently interesting life, Vespasia had never known anyone less likely to fear unreasonably.<br><br>He offered her his arm. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll walk in the garden. It&#x2019;s small, but it&#x2019;s very pleasant, even at this time of the year.&#x201d;<br><br>At the door, he put her cloak around her and she felt his touch linger a moment longer than necessary. The pressure of his fingers was light, but she was aware of its warmth, and it pleased her.<br><br>The garden was indeed small, little more than a wide-�open courtyard with a few vines on the supporting pillars of the extended roof. A couple of cypress trees rose like black flames beside the fountain, which flowed with slight sound into the stone pool. The four hanging lanterns were too dim to detract from the blaze of stars across the open center.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s hardly room to walk,&#x201d; he said with regret. &#x201c;But at least there&#x2019;s no one here to disturb.&#x201d; The moment he said it, she saw that he was mistaken. A shadow detached itself from one of the farther pillars, was visible for a moment, then melted into the hollow of the arcade and disappeared. She felt his hand tighten on her arm, and she stopped.<br><br>&#x201c;Possibly a servant,&#x201d; she said quietly. It was ridiculous to be distressed by it.<br><br>&#x201c;Or someone keeping an assignation,&#x201d; Narraway suggested, beginning to move again.<br><br>Vespasia looked upward at the sweep of stars, now that the darker sky made them brilliant. &#x201c;I imagine they&#x2019;ll be even better out in the desert, when we take the train to Jerusalem. The stars seem so much farther away in London; here they look almost close enough to touch&#x2014;�just stretch a little more, stand on tiptoe. I wonder if that is why Christ was born in a place like this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For the stars?&#x201d; he said with disbelief.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, the wise men could hardly follow the star on a winter night in London,&#x201d; she said reasonably.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you believe that, about the star?&#x201d; he asked with interest, and perhaps a shadow of amusement. He was standing a little behind her, close enough to keep the faint breeze from chilling her. &#x201c;If they could see it, why couldn&#x2019;t everyone else? Why couldn&#x2019;t Herod, for a start? Didn&#x2019;t he ask them where it led, and to come back and tell him?&#x201d;<br><br>She was silent for a moment. She had not considered it before. Indeed, why had the frightened, jealous Herod not seen the star himself? Why did he need the wise men to return and tell him where it had guided them?<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she said at last. &#x201c;Perhaps you only recognize what you are looking for.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But he was looking for it,&#x201d; Narraway pointed out.<br><br>She thought for a moment longer. &#x201c;He was looking for a rival king, in order to kill him while he was still an infant. The wise men were looking for a different kind of king, one to whom they brought gifts, symbolic of who he was.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; His voice lifted with mild curiosity.<br><br>&#x201c;Gold for the king, frankincense for the priest, and myrrh for the sacrifice,&#x201d; she told him.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know that was what they meant,&#x201d; he admitted. &#x201c;Do you want to walk out into the next courtyard? It goes beyond the archway there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What a good idea,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;Then in to dinner.&#x201d;<br><br>)<br><br>They were still early for the meal, and found themselves in a very pleasant lounge, where they asked if they might join an elderly man who was sitting alone near the fire. His hair was white, and his high-�browed aquiline face was weathered by wind and sun, and&#x2014;�Vespasia guessed&#x2014;�by much thought. The lines in it were etched deeply, and yet they only added to the beauty of his repose.<br><br>Narraway introduced himself and Vespasia, and they took the offered seats near him. The man spoke of his occupation as an astronomer, but he did not offer them his name.<br><br>&#x201c;You are English,&#x201d; he said with a smile. &#x201c;Much traveled, perhaps, but I think this is your first time in this land, whatever name you choose to give it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Narraway agreed. &#x201c;And you?&#x201d;<br><br>The man smiled. &#x201c;I confess, I travel so much I sometimes forget where I began. The world is full of interest, and beauty. The span of one life offers barely a taste of it: just sufficient to know that it is infinitely precious. Are you perhaps journeying to Jerusalem for Christmas?&#x201d; His eyes were bright, and he regarded them carefully. &#x201c;And yet you do not look like pilgrims, in the ordinary sense.&#x201d; He smiled, to rob his words of presumption. There was great gentleness in his face, and also perhaps a shadow, as if he saw, even at this moment, some of the darker things one does not easily mention to strangers.<br><br>&#x201c;Our visit is a Christmas gift,&#x201d; Vespasia told him. &#x201c;Do you know the country well?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very,&#x201d; the man replied. &#x201c;I shall go to Jerusalem again this year, for Christmas.&#x201d; He hesitated. &#x201c;I think.&#x201d; The shadow was in his eyes again. <br><br>For a moment, Vespasia&#x2019;s gaze was drawn to a small movement near the door, as if someone had pushed the door to the lounge open but gone away again without coming in. Then she looked back at the man.<br><br>&#x201c;You go often?&#x201d; she asked, smiling. <br><br>The man also smiled, as if filled with many memories. It was a sweet expression. &#x201c;Very,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;But whilst you are here, there are other cities you must see as well. Petra, for example. You approach it on horseback, through a great defile in the cliffs, and suddenly there it is in front of you, rose red, as if it were not man-�made, but has grown up out of the rich, burning rock around it.&#x201d;<br><br>He was traveling in a vision of his own, and neither Vespasia nor Narraway interrupted him.<br><br>&#x201c;Or Persepolis,&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;You stand there in the evening light, like this, as if you were a traveler in time. The ruins of empires tower slender and exquisite into the sky, and you hear the camel bells as the caravans pass, eternally journeying through time, exactly as they were a thousand years ago, or two thousand, or five. Abraham could have paid his tithes to Melchizedek, and fled on his way into Egypt just so.&#x201d; He looked at Narraway. &#x201c;To step aside from the forward flow of time every now and again is a good thing. As long, of course, as you do not forget to return to the present. There is much to do, battles to be fought, wounds to heal. But from the look in your eyes, perhaps you know that?&#x201d;<br><br>Narraway smiled back at him. &#x201c;Not in what remains of this year. We are on holiday. It is the first real one we have had together. Events have always intruded before. Perhaps we stayed too close to home.&#x201d; There was a touch of regret in his voice, and Vespasia heard it. She would have reached out to touch him, had they been alone.<br><br>The old man&#x2019;s face was wistful. &#x201c;My dear friend, Jerusalem is the heart&#x2019;s home to all of us, and there is no escaping it.&#x201d;<br><br>Once again Vespasia, facing the doorway more than the others, was aware of a shadow beyond. The moment was so fleeting the shadow could almost have been an illusion, except for the breath of coldness it sent through her. They were being watched by someone who did not wish to be seen.<br><br>She forced the thought from her mind and joined in the conversation about travel until they were called to dinner. Without hesitation she invited the old man to join them, and he accepted with evident pleasure.<br><br>The food was simple but delicious, a delicately flavored whitefish, with only the lightest sauce, and a grain she had not tasted before, flavored with herbs. There was also a light dessert, a delicate pastry filled with fresh fruit. However, the chief pleasure was the conversation. They spoke of cities and of people. The old man had visited places that neither Vespasia nor Narraway had seen. He described Isfahan.<br><br>&#x201c;I remember standing on the cool sand in the night,&#x201d; he said quietly. &#x201c;The ancient minarets towered up into a sky almost white with stars, and there was not even a whisper of the wind. Then I heard the camels, and they appeared out of the darkness, piled high with who knows what? Silks, spices, ivory, gold. They came toward me with that strange, lurching gait that they have, at once so awkward, and yet so graceful, and there was no sound in the night except the bells. I thought of the old Silk Road, of Samarkand, and also Trebizond, and other places with marvelous names.&#x201d;<br><br>Narraway spoke a little of Bruges, and Saint Petersburg, and other cities built on canals. But even more they spoke of ideas. Some things were remembered with laughter, some with sadness, all were unique.<br><br>&#x201c;Such dreams,&#x201d; the old man said gently. &#x201c;As if we could climb high enough to reach the stars in heaven.&#x201d;<br><br>Again Vespasia saw, in the corner of her vision, the shadow pass the doorway and disappear. It was without the shading of fabric or the form of a man, the catching of the light on a shoulder or the curve of a head or face.<br><br>&#x201c;Someone is watching us,&#x201d; she said in a low voice, leaning closer to the old gentleman, thinking he may know who it was. Then, instantly, she thought how foolish it sounded.<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; the old man agreed quietly with a sudden bleakness in his face. &#x201c;I think the time is close. Perhaps tonight, or tomorrow.&#x201d; He looked up to address them both. &#x201c;Share this bottle of wine with me, in the name of companionship.&#x201d;<br><br>Vespasia felt a coldness like a fourth presence in the room. She looked at Narraway, but there was nothing in his face to suggest that he had felt it too or that he had heard their brief exchange. She accepted the wine, blood red in the lamplight, and drank to companionship in the journey, and wondered if each of them meant something different by the words. She had thought of the warmth, the love of discovery, friendship, however brief. Did the old man mean something more? She glanced at Narraway, but saw only interest in his face.</p><h2>Forge of Darkness (The Kharkanas Trilogy)</h2><p>Now is the time to tell the story of an ancient realm, a tragic tale that sets the stage for all the tales yet to come and all those already told... It&#39;s a conflicted time in Kurald Galain, the realm of Darkness, where Mother Dark reigns. But this ancient land was once home to many a power. and even death is not quite eternal. The commoners&#39; great hero, Vatha Urusander, is being promoted by his followers to take Mother Dark&#39;s hand in marriage, but her Consort, Lord Draconus, stands in the way of such ambitions. The impending clash sends fissures throughout the realm, and as the rumors of civil war burn through the masses, an ancient power emerges from the long dead seas. Caught in the middle of it all are the First Sons of Darkness, Anomander, Andarist, and Silchas Ruin of the Purake Hold...

He lives in Canada.<p>Forge of Darkness</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>PART ONE</p> <p><i>In these gifts the shapes of adoration</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>ONE</p> <p><i>T</i><i>HERE WILL BE PEACE.</i></p> <p><i>&nbsp;</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The words were carved deep across the lintel stone's facing in the ancient language of the Azathanai. The cuts looked raw, untouched by wind or rain, and because of this, they might have seemed as youthful and as innocent as the sentiment itself. A witness lacking literacy would see only the violence of the mason's hand, but surely it is fair to say that the ignorant are not capable of irony. Yet like the house-hound who by scent alone will know a guest's true nature, the uncomprehending witness surrenders nothing when it comes to subtle truths. Accordingly, the savage wounding of the lintel stone's basalt face remained imposing and significant to the unversed, even as the freshness of the carved words gave pause to those who understood them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>There will be peace.</i> Conviction is a fist of stone at the heart of all things. Its form is shaped by sure hands, the detritus quickly swept from view. It is built to withstand, built to defy challenge, and when cornered it fights without honour. There is nothing more terrible than conviction.</p> <p>It was generally held that no one of Azathanai blood could be found within Dracons Hold. Indeed, few of those weary-eyed creatures from beyond Bareth Solitude ever visited the city-state of Kurald Galain, except as stone-cutters and builders of edifices, summoned to some task or venture. But the Hold's lord was not a man to welcome questions in matters of personal inclination. If by an Azathanai hand ambivalent words were carved above the threshold to the Hold's Great House - as if to announce a new age with either a promise or a threat - that was solely the business of Lord Draconus, Consort to Mother Dark.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In any case, it was not often of late that the Hold was home to its lord, now that he stood at her side in the Citadel of Kharkanas, making his sudden return after a night's hard ride both disquieting and the source of whispered rumours.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The thunder of horse hoofs approached through the faint light of the sun's rise - a light ever muted by the Hold's nearness to the heart of Mother Dark's power - and that sound grew until it rumbled through the arched gateway and pounded into the courtyard, scattering red clay from the road beyond. Neck arched by the reins held tight in his master's gloved hands, the warhorse Calaras drew up, breath billowing, lather streaming down its sleek black neck and chest. The sight gave the onrushing grooms pause.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The huge man commanding this formidable beast then dismounted, abandoning the reins to dangle, and strode without comment into the Great House. Household servants scrambled like hens from his path.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There was no hint of emotion upon the Lord's face, but this was a detail well known and not unexpected. Draconus gave nothing away, and perhaps it was the mystery in those so-dark eyes that had ever been the source of his power. His likeness, brushed by the brilliant artist Kadaspala of House Enes, now commanded pride of place in the Citadel's Hall of Portraits, and it was indeed a hand of genius that had managed to capture the unknowable in Draconus's visage, the hint of something beyond the perfection of his Tiste features, a deepening behind the proof of his pure blood. It was the image of a man who was king in all but name.</p> <p><br>&nbsp;</p> <p><br>&nbsp;</p> <p>Arathan stood at the window of the Old Tower, having taken position there upon hearing the bell announcing his father's imminent return. He watched Draconus ride into the courtyard, eyes missing nothing, one hand up to his face as he bit skin and pieces of nail from his fingers - the tips were red nubs, swollen with endless spit, and on occasion they bled, staining the sheets of his bed at night. He studied the movements of Draconus as the huge man dismounted, carelessly abandoning Calaras to the grooms, to then stride towards the entrance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The three-storey tower commanded the northwest corner of the Great House, with the house's main doors to the right and out of sight from the upper floor's window. At moments like these, Arathan would tense, breath held, straining with all his senses for the moment when his father crossed the threshold and set foot on the hard bared stones of the vestibule. He waited, for a change in the atmosphere, a trembling in the ancient walls of the edifice, the very thunder of the Lord's presence.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As ever, there was nothing. And Arathan never knew if the failing was his, or if his father's power was sealed away inside that imposing frame and behind those unerring eyes, contained by a will verging on perfection. He suspected the former - he saw how others reacted, the tightening of expressions among the highborn, the shying away of those of lesser rank, and how on occasion both reactions warred within the same individual. Draconus was feared for reasons Arathan could not comprehend.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In truth, he did not expect more of himself in this matter. He was a bastard son, after all, and a child born of a mother he never knew and had never heard named. In his seventeen years of life he had been in the same room with his father perhaps twenty times; surely no more than that, and not once had Draconus addressed him. He was not privileged to dine in the main hall; he was tutored in private and taught the use of weapons alongside the recruits of the Houseblades. Even in the days and nights immediately following his near-drowning, when in his ninth winter he'd fallen through ice, he'd been attended to by the guards' healer, and had received no visitors barring his three younger half-sisters, who had peered in through the doorway - a trio of round, wide-eyed faces - only to immediately flee down the corridor voicing squeals.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For years, their reaction upon seeing him had led Arathan to believe he was unaccountably ugly, a conviction that had first brought his hands to his face in a habit of hiding his features, and soon the kiss of his own fingertips served for all the tactile reassurance he required. He no longer believed himself to be ugly. Simply ... plain, not worthy of notice by anyone.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Though no one ever spoke of his mother, Arathan knew that she had named him. His father's predilections on such matters were far crueller. He told himself that he remembered his half-sisters' mother, a brooding, heavy woman with a strange face, who had either died or departed shortly after weaning the triplets she had borne, but a later comment from Tutor Sagander suggested that the woman he'd remembered had been a wet-nurse, a witch of the Dog-Runners who dwelt beyond the Solitude. Still, he preferred to think of her as the girls' mother, too kind-hearted to give them the names they now possessed - names that, to Arathan's mind, shackled each sister like a curse.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Envy. Spite. Malice.</i> They remained infrequent visitors to his company. Flighty as birds glimpsed from the corner of an eye. Whispering from around corners in the corridors and behind doors he walked past. Clearly, they found him a source of great amusement.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now in the first years of adulthood, Arathan saw himself as a prisoner, or perhaps a hostage in the traditional manner of alliance-binding among the Greater Houses and Holds. He was not of the Dracons family; though there had been no efforts at hiding his bloodline, in fact the very indifference of this detail only emphasized its irrelevance. Seeds spill where they may, but a sire must look into the eyes to make the child his own. And this Draconus would not do. Besides, there was little of Tiste blood in him - he had not the fair skin or tall frame, and his eyes, while dark, lacked the mercurial ambivalence of the pure-born. In these details, he was the same as his sisters. Where, then, the blood of their father?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>It hides. Somehow, it hides deep within us.</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Draconus would not acknowledge him, but that was no cause for resentment in Arathan's mind. Man or woman, once childhood was past the world beyond must be met, and a place in it made, by a will entirely dependent upon its own resources. And the shaping of that world, its weight and weft, was a match to the strength of that will. In this way, Kurald Galain society was a true map of talent and capacity. Or so Sagander told him, almost daily.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Whether in the court of the Citadel or among the March villages, there could be no dissembling. The insipid and the incompetent had no place in which to hide their failings. <i>'This is natural justice, Arathan, and thus by every measure it is superior to the justice of, say, the Forulkan, or the Jaghut.'</i> Arathan had no good reason to believe otherwise. This world, so forcefully espoused by his tutor, was all he had ever known.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>And yet he ... doubted.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Sandalled feet slapped closer up the spiral stairs behind him, and Arathan turned in some surprise. He had long since claimed this tower for his own, made himself lord of its dusty webs, its shadows and echoes. Only here could he be himself, with no one batting his hand away from his mouth, or mocking his ruined fingertips. No one visited him here; the house-bells called him when lessons or meals were imminent; he measured his days and nights by those muted chimes.</p> <p>The footsteps approached. His heart thumped in his chest. He snatched his hand away from his mouth, wiped the fingers on his tunic, and stood facing the gap of the stairs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The figure that climbed into view startled him. One of his half-sisters, the shortest of the three - <i>last from the womb</i> - her face flushed with the effort of the climb, her breath coming in little gasps. Dark eyes found his. 'Arathan.'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>She had never before addressed him. He did not know how to respond.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>'It's me,' she said, eyes flaring as if in anger. 'Malice. Your sister, Malice.'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>'Names shouldn't be curses,' Arathan said without thinking.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>If his words shocked her, the only indication was a faint tilt of her head as she regarded him. 'So you're not the simpleton Envy says you are. Good. Father will be ... relieved.'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>'Father?'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>'You are summoned, Arathan. Right now - I'm to bring you to him.'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>'Father?'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>She scowled. 'She knew you'd be hiding here, like a redge in a hole. Said you were just as thick. Are you? Is she right? Are you a redge? She's always right - or so she'll tell you.' She darted close and took Arathan's left wrist, tugged him along as she returned to the stairs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>He did not resist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Father had summoned him. He could think of only one reason for that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>I am about to be cast out.</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The dusty air of the Old Tower stairs swirled round them as they descended, and the peace of this place felt shattered. But soon it would settle again, and the emptiness would return, like an ousted king to his throne, and Arathan knew that he would never again challenge that domain. It had been a foolish conceit, a childish game.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>'In natural justice, Arathan, the weak cannot hide, unless we grant them the privilege. And understand, it is ever a privilege, for which the weak should be eternally grateful. At any given moment, should the strong will it, they can swing a sword and end the life of the weak. And that will be today's lesson. Forbearance.'</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A redge in a hole - the beast's life is tolerated, until its presence becomes a nuisance, and then the dogs are loosed down the earthen tunnel, into the warrens, and somewhere beneath the ground the redge is torn apart, ripped to pieces. Or driven into the open, where wait spears and swords eager to take its life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Either way, the creature was clearly unmindful of the privileges granted to it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>All the lessons Sagander delivered to Arathan circled like wolves around weakness, and the proper place of those cursed with it. No, Arathan was not a simpleton. He understood well enough.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>And, one day, he would hurt Draconus, in ways not yet imaginable. <i>Father, I believe I am your weakness.</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the meantime, as he hurried along behind Malice, her grip tight on his wrist, he brought up his other hand, and chewed.</p> <p><br>&nbsp;</p> <p><br>&nbsp;</p> <p>Master-at-arms Ivis wiped sweat from his brow while he waited outside the door. The summons had come while he'd been in the smithy, instructing the iron-master on the proper honing of a folded edge. It was said that those with Hust blood knew iron as if they'd suckled its molten stream from their mother's tit, and Ivis had no doubt in this matter - the smith was a skilled man and a fine maker of weapons, but Ivis possessed Hust blood on his father's side, and though he counted himself a soldier through and through, he could hear a flawed edge even as a blade was being drawn from its scabbard.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Iron-master Gilal took it well enough, although of course there was no telling. He'd ducked his head and muttered his apologies as befitted his lesser rank, and as Ivis left he heard the huge man bellowing at his apprentices - none of whom was in any way responsible for the flawed edge, since the final stages of blade preparation were always by the iron-master's own hand. With that tirade Ivis knew that no venom would come back his way from the iron-master.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>He told himself now, as he waited outside his lord's Chamber of Campaigns, that the sweat stinging his eyes was a legacy of the four forges in the smithy, the air wretched with heat and bitter metal, with coal dust and smoke, with the frantic efforts of the workers as they struggled with the day's demands.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Abyss knew, the smithy was no factory, and yet it had achieved an impressive rate of stock production in the past two months, and not one of the new recruits coming to the Great House was left unarmoured or weaponless for long. Making his task that much easier.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But now the Lord was back, unexpectedly, and Ivis scoured his mind for the possible cause. Draconus was a measured man, not prone to precipitous acts. He had the patience of stone, but all knew the risk of wronging him. Something had brought him back to the Great House, and a night's hard ride would not have left him in a good mood.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>And now a summons, only to be left waiting here outside the door. No, none of this was normal.</p> <p>A moment later he heard footsteps and the portal clicked open. Ivis found himself staring into the face of the House tutor, Sagander. The old scholar had the look of a man who had been frightened and was still fighting its aftermath. Meeting Ivis's eyes, he nodded.

At the notion, Ivis berated himself. He hardly ever saw the tutor, who overslept every morning and was often the last to make bed at night - there was no reason to imagine Sagander was anything more than disquieted by the early meeting, and perhaps an understandable stiffness as came with the elderly this early in the morning.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Drawing a steadying breath, Ivis strode into the chamber.</p></p><h2>Tiny Little Thing</h2><p>In the summer of 1966, Christina Hardcastle&#x2014;&#x201c;Tiny&#x201d; to her illustrious family&#x2014;stands on the brink of a breathtaking future. Of the three Schuyler sisters, she&#x2019;s the one raised to marry a man destined for leadership, and with her elegance and impeccable style, she presents a perfect camera-ready image in the dawning age of television politics. Together she and her husband, Frank, make the ultimate power couple: intelligent, rich, and impossibly attractive. It seems nothing can stop Frank from rising to national office, and he&#x2019;s got his sights set on a senate seat in November.<br>&nbsp;<br>But as the season gets underway at the family estate on Cape Cod, three unwelcome visitors appear in Tiny&#x2019;s perfect life: her volatile sister Pepper, an envelope containing incriminating photograph, and the intimidating figure of Frank&#x2019;s cousin Vietnam-war hero Caspian, who knows more about Tiny&#x2019;s rich inner life than anyone else. As she struggles to maintain the glossy fa�ade on which the Hardcastle family&#x2019;s ambitions are built, Tiny begins to suspect that Frank is hiding a reckless entanglement of his own...one that may unravel both her own ordered life and her husband&#x2019;s promising career.</p><p><b>Beatriz Williams</b> is the <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author of <i>The Secret Life of Violet Grant</i>, <i>A Hundred Summers</i>, and <i>Overseas</i>. She lives with her husband and children in Greenwich, Connecticut.<p>CONTENTS</p><p></p><p>Tiny, 1966</p><p>CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS</p><p>The first photograph arrives in the mail on the same day that my husband appears on television at the Medal of Honor ceremony. It&#x2019;s accompanied by the customary note written in block capital letters. By now, I know enough about politics&#x2014;and about my husband&#x2019;s family, I suppose&#x2014;to suspect this isn&#x2019;t a coincidence.</p><p>There&#x2019;s no return address (of course, there wouldn&#x2019;t be, would there?), but the envelope was postmarked yesterday in Boston, and the stamps are George Washington, five cents each. A plain manila envelope, letter size, of the sort they use in offices: I flip it back and forth between my fingers, while my heart bounds and rebounds against my ribs.</p><p>&#x201c;Tiny, my dear.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s my husband&#x2019;s grandmother, calling from the living room. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you going to watch the ceremony?&#x201d;</p><p>She has a remarkable way of forming a sociable question into a court summons, and like a court summons, she can&#x2019;t be ignored. I smooth my hand against the envelope once, twice, as if I can evaporate the contents&#x2014;<i>poof, presto!</i>&#x2014;in the stroke of a palm, and I slide it into one of the more obscure pigeonholes in the secretary, where the mail is laid every day by the housekeeper.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, of course,&#x201d; I call back.</p><p>The television has been bought new for the occasion. Generally, Granny Hardcastle frowns on modern devices; even my husband, Franklin, has to hide in the attic in order to listen to Red Sox games on the radio. The wireless, she calls it, a little disdainfully, though she&#x2019;s not necessarily averse to Sinatra or Glenn Miller in the evenings, while she sits in her favorite chintz chair in the living room and drinks her small glass of cognac. It drowns out the sound of the ocean, she says, which I can never quite comprehend. In the first place, you can&#x2019;t drown out the ocean when it flings itself persistently against your shore, wave after wave, only fifty yards past the shingled walls of your house, no matter how jazzy the trumpets backing up Mr. Sinatra.</p><p>In the second place, why would you want to?</p><p>I pause at the tray to pour myself a glass of lemonade. I add a splash of vodka, but only a tiny one. &#x201c;Have they started yet?&#x201d; I ask, trying to sound as cool as I look. The vodka, I&#x2019;ve found, is a reliable refrigerant.</p><p>&#x201c;No. They&#x2019;re trying to sell me Clorox.&#x201d; Granny Hardcastle stubs out her cigarette in the silver ashtray next to her chair&#x2014;she smokes habitually, but only in front of women&#x2014;and chews on her irony.</p><p>&#x201c;Lemonade?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, thank you. I&#x2019;ll have another cigarette, though.&#x201d;</p><p>I make my way to the sofa and open the drawer in the lamp table, where Mrs. Hardcastle keeps the cigarettes. Our little secret. I shake one out of the pack and tilt my body toward the television set, feigning interest in bleach, so that Franklin&#x2019;s grandmother won&#x2019;t see the wee shake of my fingers as I strike the lighter and hold it to the tip of the cigarette. These are the sorts of details she notices.</p><p>I hand her the lit cigarette.</p><p>&#x201c;Sit down,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re as restless as a cat.&#x201d;</p><p>There. Do you see what I mean? Just imagine spending the summer in the same house with her. You&#x2019;d be slipping the vodka into your lemonade in no time, trust me.</p><p>The French doors crash open from the terrace.</p><p>&#x201c;Has it started yet?&#x201d; asks one of the cousins&#x2014;Constance, probably&#x2014;before they all clatter in, brown limbed, robed in pinks and greens, smelling of ocean and coconuts.</p><p>&#x201c;Not yet. Lemonade?&#x201d;</p><p>I pour out four or five glasses of lemonade while the women arrange themselves about the room. Most of them arrived as I did, at the beginning of summer, members of the annual exodus of women and children from the Boston suburbs; some of them have flown in from elsewhere for the occasion. The men, with a few exceptions, are at work&#x2014;this is a Wednesday, after all&#x2014;and will join us tomorrow for a celebratory dinner to welcome home the family hero.</p><p>I pour a last glass of lemonade for Frank&#x2019;s four-year-old niece Nancy and settle myself into the last remaining slice of the sofa, ankles correctly crossed, skirt correctly smoothed. The cushions release an old and comforting scent. Between the lemonade and the ambient nicotine and the smell of the sofa, I find myself able to relax the muscles of my neck, and maybe one or two in my back as well. The television screen flickers silently across the room. The bottle of bleach disappears, replaced by Walter Cronkite&#x2019;s thick black eyeglass frames, and behind them, Mr. Cronkite himself, looking especially grave.</p><p>&#x201c;Tiny, dear, would you mind turning on the sound?&#x201d;</p><p>I rise obediently and cut a diagonal track across the rug to the television. It&#x2019;s not a large set, nor one of those grandly appointed ones you see in certain quarters. Like most of our caste, Mrs. Hardcastle invests lavishly in certain things, things that matter, things that last&#x2014;jewelry, shoes, houses, furniture, the education of the next generation of Hardcastles&#x2014;and not in others. Like television sets. And food. If you care to fasten your attention to the tray left out by the housekeeper, you&#x2019;ll spy an arrangement of Ritz crackers and pimiento spread, cubes of American cheese and small pale rubbery weenies from a jar. As I pass them by, on my return journey, I think of my honeymoon in the south of France, and I want to weep.</p><p>&#x201c;You should eat,&#x201d; Constance says, when I sit back down next to her. Constance is as fresh and rawboned as a young horse, and believes that every thin woman must necessarily be starving herself.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not hungry yet. Anyway, I had a large breakfast.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shh. Here they are,&#x201d; says Granny. Her armchair is right next to my place at the end of the sofa. So close I can smell her antique floral perfume and, beneath it, the scent of her powder, absorbing the joy from the air.</p><p>The picture&#x2019;s changed to the Rose Garden of the White House, where the president&#x2019;s face fills the screen like a grumpy newborn.</p><p>&#x201c;It looks hot,&#x201d; says Constance. A chorus of agreement follows her. People generally regard Constance&#x2019;s opinions as addenda to the Ten Commandments around here. The queen bee, you might say, and in this family that&#x2019;s saying a lot. Atop her lap, a baby squirms inside a pink sundress, six months old and eager to try out the floor. &#x201c;Poor Frank, having to stand there like that,&#x201d; she adds, when it looks as if President Johnson means to prolong the anticipation for some time, droning on about the importance of the American presence in Vietnam and the perfidy of the Communists, while the Rose Garden blooms behind him.</p><p>A shadow drifts in from the terrace: Constance&#x2019;s husband, Tom, wearing his swim trunks, a white T-shirt, and an experimental new beard of three or four days&#x2019; growth. He leans his salty wet head against the open French door and observes us all, women and children and television. I scribble a note on the back of my brain, amid all the orderly lists of tasks, organized by category, to make sure the glass gets cleaned before bedtime.</p><p>Granny leans forward. &#x201c;You should have gone with him, Tiny. It looks much better when the wife&#x2019;s by his side. Especially a young and pretty wife like you. The cameras love a pretty wife. So do the reporters. You&#x2019;re made for television.&#x201d;</p><p>She speaks in her carrying old-lady voice, into a pool of studied silence, as everyone pretends not to have heard her. Except the children, of course, who carry on as usual. Kitty wanders up to my crossed legs and strokes one knee. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re pretty, too, Aunt Christina.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, thank you, honey.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Careful with your lemonade, kitten,&#x201d; says Constance.</p><p>I caress Kitty&#x2019;s soft hair and speak to Granny quietly. &#x201c;The doctor advised me not to, Mrs. Hardcastle.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My dear, it&#x2019;s been a week. I went to my niece&#x2019;s christening the next <i>day</i> after <i>my</i> miscarriage.&#x201d;</p><p>The word <i>miscarriage</i> pings around the room, bouncing off the heads of Frank&#x2019;s florid female cousins, off Kitty&#x2019;s glass of sloshing lemonade, off the round potbellies of the three or four toddlers wandering around the room, off the fat sausage toes of the two plump babies squirming on their mothers&#x2019; laps. Every one of them alive and healthy and lousy with siblings.</p><p>After a decent interval, and a long drag on her cigarette, Granny Hardcastle adds: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, dear. It&#x2019;ll take the next time, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;</p><p>I straighten the hem of my dress. &#x201c;I think the president&#x2019;s almost finished.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For which the nation is eternally grateful,&#x201d; says Constance.</p><p>The camera now widens to include the entire stage, the figures arrayed around the president, lit by a brilliant June sun. Constance is right; you can&#x2019;t ignore the heat, even on a grainy black-and-white television screen. The sweat shines from the white surfaces of their foreheads. I close my eyes and breathe in the wisps of smoke from Constance&#x2019;s nearby cigarette, and when I open them again to the television screen, I search out the familiar shape of my husband&#x2019;s face, attentive to his president, attentive to the gravity of the ceremony.</p><p><i>A horse&#x2019;s ass,</i> Frank&#x2019;s always called Johnson in the privacy of our living room, but not one member of the coast-to-coast television audience would guess this opinion to look at my husband now. He&#x2019;s a handsome man, Franklin Hardcastle, and even more handsome in person, when the full Technicolor impact of his blue eyes hits you in the chest and that sleek wave of hair at his forehead commands the light from three dimensions. His elbows are crooked in perfect right angles. His hands clasp each other respectfully behind his back.</p><p>I think of the black-and-white photograph in its envelope, tucked away in the pigeonhole of the secretary. I think of the note that accompanied it, and my hand loses its grip, nearly releasing the lemonade onto the living room rug.</p><p>The horse&#x2019;s ass has now adjusted his glasses and reads from the citation on the podium before him. He pronounces the foreign geography in his smooth Texas drawl, without the slightest hesitation, as if he&#x2019;s spent the morning rehearsing with a Vietnamese dictionary.</p><p>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;After carrying his wounded comrade to safety, under constant enemy fire, he then returned to operate the machine gun himself, providing cover for his men until the position at Plei Me was fully evacuated, without regard to the severity of his wounds.&#x201d;</p><p>Oh, yes. That. <i>The severity of his wounds</i>. I&#x2019;ve heard the phrase before, as the citation was read before us all in Granny Hardcastle&#x2019;s dining room in Brookline, cabled word for word at considerable expense from the capital of a grateful nation. I can also recite from memory an itemized list of the wounds in question, from the moment they were first reported to me, two days after they&#x2019;d been inflicted. They are scored, after all, on my brain.</p><p>None of that helps a bit, however. My limbs ache, actually <i>hurt</i> as I hear the words from President Johnson&#x2019;s lips. My ears ring, as if my faculties, in self-defense, are trying to protect me from hearing the litany once more. How is it possible I can feel someone else&#x2019;s pain like that? Right bang in the middle of my bones, where no amount of aspirin, no quantity of vodka, no draft of mentholated nicotine can touch it.</p><p>My husband listens to this recital without flinching. I focus on his image in that phalanx of dark suits and white foreheads. I admire his profile, his brave jaw. The patriotic crease at the corner of his eye.</p><p>&#x201c;He does look well, doesn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; says Granny. &#x201c;Really, you&#x2019;d never know about the leg. Could you pass me the cigarettes?&#x201d;</p><p>One of the women reaches for the drawer and passes the cigarettes silently down the row of us on the sofa. I hand the pack and lighter to Granny Hardcastle without looking. The camera switches back to a close-up of the president&#x2019;s face, the conclusion of the commendation.</p><p>You have to keep looking, I tell myself. You have to watch.</p><p>I close my eyes again. Which is worse somehow, because when your eyes are closed, you hear the sounds around you even more clearly than before. You hear them in the middle of your brain, as if they originated inside you.</p><p>&#x201c;This nation presents to you, Major Caspian Harrison, its highest honor and its grateful thanks for your bravery, your sacrifice, and your unflinching care for the welfare of your men and your country. At a time when heroes have become painfully scarce, your example inspires us all.&#x201d;</p><p>From across the room, Constance&#x2019;s husband makes a disgusted noise. The hinges squeak, and a gust of hot afternoon air catches my cheek as the door to the terrace widens and closes.</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you shutting your eyes, Tiny? Are you all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just a little dizzy, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, come on. Get over it. You&#x2019;re going to miss him. The big moment.&#x201d;</p><p>I open my eyes, because I have to, and there stands President Lyndon Johnson, shaking hands with the award&#x2019;s recipient.</p><p>The award&#x2019;s recipient: my husband&#x2019;s cousin, Major Caspian Harrison of the Third Infantry Division of the U.S. Army, who now wears the Medal of Honor on his broad chest.</p><p>His face, unsmiling, which I haven&#x2019;t seen in two years, pops from the screen in such familiarity that I can&#x2019;t swallow, can hardly even breathe. I reach forward to place my lemonade on the sofa table, but in doing so I can&#x2019;t quite strip my gaze from the sandy-gray image of Caspian on the television screen and nearly miss my target.</p><p>Next to him, tall and monochrome, looking remarkably presidential, my husband beams proudly.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>He calls me a few hours later from a hotel room in Boston. &#x201c;Did you see it?&#x201d; he asks eagerly.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I did. You looked terrific.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Beautiful day. Cap handled himself fine, thank God.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s his leg?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Honey, the first thing you have to know about my cousin Cap, he doesn&#x2019;t complain.&#x201d; Frank laughs. &#x201c;No, he was all right. Hardly even limped. Modern medicine, it&#x2019;s amazing. I was proud of him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I could see that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s right here, if you want to congratulate him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No! No, please. I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s exhausted. Just tell him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tell him congratulations. And we&#x2019;re all very proud, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cap!&#x201d; His voice lengthens. &#x201c;Tiny says congratulations, and they&#x2019;re all proud. They watched it from the Big House, I guess. Did Granny get that television after all?&#x201d; This comes through more clearly, directed at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, she did. Connie&#x2019;s husband helped her pick it out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, good. At least we have a television in the house now. We owe you one, Cap buddy.&#x201d;</p><p>A few muffled words find the receiver. Cap&#x2019;s voice.</p><p>Frank laughs again. &#x201c;You can bet on it. Besides the fact that you&#x2019;ve given my poll numbers a nice little boost today, flashing that ugly mug across the country like that.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Muffle muffle.</i> I try not to strain my ears. What&#x2019;s the point?</p><p>Whatever Caspian said, my husband finds it hilarious. &#x201c;You little bastard,&#x201d; he says, laughing, and then (still laughing): &#x201c;Sorry, darling. Just a little man-to-man going on here. Say, you&#x2019;ll never guess who&#x2019;s driving down with us tomorrow morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your sister Pepper.&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Pepper?&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x201c;Yep.

Amen, M.D. Using a nuclear medicine technique called "single photon emission computed tomography" (SPECT)--a controversial step, according to some of his peers--Dr. Amen scans patients' brains to identify various abnormalities. From more than 8,000 such studies and more than 12,000 patient evaluations, Dr. Amen concludes that six--not the formerly presumed two--different types of ADD exist. This book encompasses the full spectrum of Dr. Amen's work: from symptom identification to clinical evaluation, to diet and medication recommendations, to everyday strategies for living with ADD (whether the reader is a parent of an ADD child, or has been diagnosed with the disease.)<p> No stranger to the skepticism surrounding this topic, Dr. Amen begins with a list of dead-on myths (including "ADD is overdiagnosed") and surprising facts ("Many people with ADD are never hyperactive"). From this intriguing beginning flows a highly readable chapter on the signs and manifestations of ADD in all ages. Dr. Amen's full description of SPECT imaging includes multiple brain scan photos that nicely support his theories. But the most satisfying element of this well-researched presentation occurs in the final half of the book; here, Amen thoroughly explores the biological (diet, exercise, medication), psychological (from personal coaching to psychotherapy), and social support (parenting and school strategies) needed to heal each type of ADD. This book will prove a valuable tool for parents, adult sufferers, and medical professionals seeking practical support for managing this increasingly recognized condition. <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p>Daniel G. Amen, M.D., is the founder and director of the Amen Clinic, where his work with brain imaging has garnered him a rapidly growing reputation. Considered one of the nation&#39;s premier child psychiatrists, he is the father of several ADD children-all of whom have been made well by the program in this book.</p><h2>Elvenblood (Halfblood Chronicles)</h2><p><p>The powerful magic of ruthless Elvenlord masters has for centuries rules the world.

She has worked as an artist's model, a computer programmer, and for American Airlines, and has written lyrics and recorded more than fifty songs. She lives in Oklahoma.</p>The prolific Norton again collaborates with Lackey to create another thinly disguised romance/miscegenation parable serving as a fantasy/adventure novel. Sheyrene and her brother, Lorryn, are kept virtual prisoners to their father's wishes, since he is a high elven lord and has powerful elven magic that can be used to remold not only their bodies but also their minds, wills and souls. When circumstances allow them to escape, they are propelled into the paths of Shauna (who was featured in The Elvenbane, the first book of the series), a half-breed leader who has control over human and elven magic, and of her friends, wizards and shape-changing dragons who want equality for all. Inevitably, romance blossoms, war threatens and heroism ensues. Though the final battle here is rushed and depressingly anticlimactic, both authors have a sweet way with characters and there is enough magic, mystery and romantic bonding of fantastic species in genetically improbable ways to keep loyal fans entertained?and anyone with an ounce of cynicism far, far away. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Herbs of the Bible: 2000 Years of Plant Medicine</h2><p>Blending history, science, and folklore, an illustrated tour of biblical healing advice focuses on the fifty-two most interesting and useful plants mentioned in the Bible, discussing the traditional and scientific basis for their use.</p><p>One of the world&#39;s most recognized authorities on botanical medicine, James A.

This famous poem has now been enhanced with full-color scenes of old rural New England.</p><p>Lydia Marie Child (1802-1880) was a celebrated American author, abolitionist, and women&#39;s rights activist. Born in Medford, MA, her grandfather&#39;s house still stands near the Mystic River as a tangible reminder of her most memorable poem.PreSchool-Grade 4-Recalling a simpler time, this book captures the poem's sense of excitement and celebration. Readers who join the family en route to Grandfather's house will observe many details about life in the 19th century. As the sleigh traverses river and woods, parents and son greet fellow New England villagers who, bundled against the cold, are at work and at play. The toe-stinging, nose-biting chill of the trip is finally broken when they arrive at the grandparents' warm house and seat themselves at the overflowing table. For those who tend to hum the words after the first two lines, all six verses, as well as the score, are printed on the endpapers. A brief note describes the poem's origin. Manson's woodcuts, painted in the colors of a snowy evening, lovingly depict the wintry countryside. In contrast, the indoor scenes are diffused with the warm shades of the season. The mood of this edition far outshines recent efforts (Normand Chartier's version [S&amp;S, 1990] features a greeting-card family of anthropomorphized bunnies).

Reprint.</p><p>Wolfe's recent multi-volume novels have invited interpretation as religious allegory. In the "Book of the Long Sun," the fourth volume of which is <i>Exodus From the Long Sun</i>, religion is at least an inspirational starting point. This book is set on a starship, the Whorl, whose inhabitants have lost track of the fact that they are on a journey. Indeed their origins are mysterious to them, and the starship's vestigial communications system is understood to bring messages from unknown gods. One priest, Patera Silk, discovers the truth about the Whorl, and the gods his people worship. Silk must prepare his people for the revelation.Gene Wolfe is one of the most admired and respected living writers of SF and fantasy.

Unlike his rival Red Army generals he was prepared to stand up to Stalin when necessary and although charming in his private life, was a brutal and decisive commander. This is the first major biography of the Soviet hero, drawing on newly available sources in the Russian archives and previously unpublished excerpts from Zhukov&#39;s own memoirs. Slightly off-mint.</p><p><b>Geoffrey Roberts</b> is the author of <i>Stalin&#x2019;s Wars</i> and <i>Victory at Stalingrad. </i>He is professor and head of the School of History at University College Cork, Ireland. Roberts is a frequent contributor to British, Irish, and American newspapers and to popular-history journals and has been a consultant for TV and radio documentaries.1.<br><br>Sic Transit Gloria:<br><br>The Rises and Falls of Marshal Georgy Zhukov<br><br>Of all the moments of triumph in the life of Marshal Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov nothing equaled that day in June 1945 when he took the salute at the great Victory Parade in Red Square. Zhukov, mounted on a magnificent white Arabian called Tspeki, rode into the square through the Spassky Gate, the Kremlin on his right and the famous onion domes of St. Basil&#x2019;s Cathedral directly ahead. As he did so a 1,400-strong orchestra struck up Glinka&#x2019;s Glory (to the Russian Motherland). Awaiting him were columns of combined regiments representing all the branches of the Soviet armed forces. In the middle of the square Zhukov met Marshal K. K. Rokossovsky, who called the parade to attention and then escorted Zhukov as he rode to each regiment and saluted them.<br><br>When the salutes were finished Zhukov joined the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin on the plinth above Lenin&#x2019;s Mausoleum and gave a speech celebrating the Red Army&#x2019;s victory over Nazi Germany. The sky was overcast and there was a drizzling rain that worsened as the day wore on. At one point Zhukov&#x2019;s hat became so wet he was tempted to remove it and wipe the visor but desisted when he saw that Stalin was making no such move.<br><br>As a former cavalryman Zhukov relished the salute portion of the proceedings. Giving a speech that would be seen and heard by millions of people across the world was a different matter. The idea made him anxious and he prepared as thoroughly as he could, even rehearsing the speech in front of his daughters Era and Ella, who were so impressed they burst into spontaneous applause. The delivery of the speech was carefully crafted, with prompts in the margin directing Zhukov to speak quietly, then louder, and when to adopt a solemn tone.<br><br>Zhukov seemed more than a little nervous but it was a commanding performance nonetheless. His delivery was halting but emphatic and reached a crescendo with his final sentence: &#x201c;Glory to our wise leader and commander&#x2014;Marshal of the Soviet Union, the Great Stalin!&#x201d; At that moment artillery fired a salute and the orchestra struck up the Soviet national anthem.<br><br>After his speech Zhukov reviewed the parade standing beside Stalin. Partway through there was a pause in the march while, to a roll of drumbeats, 200 captured Nazi banners were piled against the Kremlin wall, much like Marshal Kutuzov&#x2019;s soldiers had thrown French standards at the feet of Tsar Alexander I after their defeat of Napoleon in 1812. The parade over, the day ended with a fabulous fireworks display.<br><br>Stalin&#x2019;s choice of Zhukov to lead the parade evoked no comment. He was, after all, Stalin&#x2019;s deputy supreme commander and widely regarded as the main architect of the Soviet victory over Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s Germany, a victory that had saved Europe as well as Russia from Nazi enslavement. Newsreel film of the parade that flashed across the world only reinforced Zhukov&#x2019;s status as the greatest Soviet general of the Second World War.<br><br>When the German armies invaded Soviet Russia in summer 1941 it was Zhukov who led the Red Army&#x2019;s first successful counteroffensive, forcing the Wehrmacht to retreat and demonstrating to the whole world that Hitler&#x2019;s war machine was not invincible. When Leningrad was surrounded by the Germans in September 1941 Stalin sent Zhukov to save the city from imminent capture. A month later, Stalin recalled Zhukov to Moscow and put him in command of the defense of the Soviet capital. Not only did Zhukov stop the German advance on Moscow, but in December 1941 he launched a counteroffensive that drove the Wehrmacht away from the city and ended Hitler&#x2019;s hope of subduing the Red Army and conquering Russia in a single Blitzkrieg campaign.<br><br>Six months later Hitler tried again to inflict a crippling blow on the Red Army, this time by launching a southern offensive designed to capture the Soviet oilfields at Baku. At the height of the German advance south Zhukov played a central role in masterminding the Soviet counteroffensive at Stalingrad in November 1942&#x2014;an encirclement operation that trapped 300,000 German troops in the city. In July 1943 he followed that dazzling success with a stunning victory in the great armored clash at Kursk&#x2014;a battle that saw the destruction of the last remaining reserves of Germany&#x2019;s panzer power. In November 1943 cheering crowds welcomed Zhukov as he and the future Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev drove into the recaptured Ukrainian capital of Kiev. In June 1944 Zhukov coordinated Operation Bagration&#x2014;the campaign to liberate Belorussia from German occupation. Bagration brought the Red Army to the gates of Warsaw and the capture of the Polish capital in January 1945 and marked the beginning of the Vistula-Oder operation&#x2014;an offensive that took Zhukov&#x2019;s armies through Poland, into eastern Germany, and to within striking distance of Berlin. In April 1945 Zhukov led the final Soviet assault on Berlin. The ferocious battle for the German capital cost the lives of 80,000 Soviet soldiers but by the end of April Hitler was dead and the Soviet flag flew over the ruins of the Reichstag. It was Zhukov who formally accepted Germany&#x2019;s unconditional surrender on May 9, 1945.<br><br>Following Zhukov&#x2019;s triumphant parade before the assembled legions of the Red Army, Navy, and Air Force in June 1945 he seemed destined for an equally glorious postwar career as the Soviet Union&#x2019;s top soldier and in March 1946 he was appointed commander-in-chief of all Soviet ground forces. However, within three months Zhukov had been sacked by Stalin and banished to the command of the Odessa Military District.<br><br>The ostensible reason for Zhukov&#x2019;s dismissal was that he had been disloyal and disrespectful toward Stalin and claimed too much personal credit for victory in the Great Patriotic War, as the Soviets called it. In truth, Zhukov&#x2019;s loyalty to Stalin was beyond question. If anyone deserved the appellation &#x201c;Stalin&#x2019;s General,&#x201d; he did. Zhukov was not slow to blow his own trumpet, at least in private, but that was characteristic of top generals the world over, including many of his colleagues in the Soviet High Command&#x2014;who all voted in favor of Stalin&#x2019;s resolution removing him as commander-in-chief. What Stalin really objected to was Zhukov&#x2019;s independent streak and his tendency to tell the truth as he saw it, a quality that had served the dictator well during the war but was less commendable in peacetime when Stalin felt he needed no advice except his own. Like Zhukov, Stalin could be vain, and he was jealous of the attention lavished on his deputy during and immediately after the war, even though he had been instrumental in the creation of Zhukov&#x2019;s reputation as a great general. Stalin&#x2019;s treatment of Zhukov also sent a message to his other generals: if Zhukov, the most famous among them and the closest to Stalin, could suffer such a fate, so could any one of them if they did not behave themselves.<br><br>According to his daughter Era, Zhukov was not a man given to overt displays of emotion, even in the privacy of his family, but his demotion and exile to Odessa caused him great distress. Later, he told the Soviet writer Konstantin Simonov: &#x201c;I was firmly resolved to remain myself. I understood that they were waiting for me to give up and expecting that I would not last a day as a district commander. I could not permit this to happen. Of course, fame is fame. At the same time it is a double-edged sword and sometimes cuts against you. After this blow I did everything to remain as I had been. In this I saw my inner salvation.&#x201d;<br><br>Zhukov&#x2019;s troubles were only just beginning, however. In February 1947 he was expelled from the Communist Party Central Committee on grounds that he had an &#x201c;antiparty attitude.&#x201d; Zhukov was horrified and he pleaded with Stalin for a private meeting with the dictator to clear his name. Stalin ignored him and the anti-Zhukov campaign continued. In June 1947 Zhukov was censured for giving the singer Lidiya Ruslanova a military medal when she had visited Berlin in August 1945. Shortly after, Ruslanova and her husband, General V. V. Krukov, were arrested and imprisoned. &#x201c;In 1947 I feared arrest every day,&#x201d; recalled Zhukov later, &#x201c;and I had a bag ready with my underwear in it.&#x201d;<br><br>The next development was even more ominous: an investigation began into the war booty Zhukov had extracted while serving in Germany. According to the report of a party commission Zhukov amassed a personal hoard of trophies, including 70 pieces of gold jewelry, 740 items of silverware, 50 rugs, 60 pictures, 3,700 meters of silk, and&#x2014;presumably after casting a professional eye over them&#x2014;320 furs (he had been a furrier in his youth). Zhukov pleaded that these were gifts or paid from his own pocket but the commission found his explanations insincere and evasive and concluded that while he did not deserve to be expelled from the party he should hand over his ill-gotten loot to the state. In January 1948 Zhukov was demoted to the command of the Urals Military District based in Sverdlovsk.<br><br>Further punishment came in the form of treating Zhukov as an &#x201c;unperson.&#x201d; He was written out of the history of the Great Patriotic War. Paintings of the 1945 Victory Parade omitted him. A 1948 documentary film about the battle of Moscow barely featured Zhukov. In a 1949 poster tableau depicting Stalin and his top generals plotting and planning the great counteroffensive at Stalingrad Zhukov was nowhere to be seen.<br><br>But as early as October 1949 there were signs of Zhukov&#x2019;s rehabilitation. That month Pravda carried a funeral notice of the death of Marshal F. I. Tolbukhin and Zhukov was listed among the signatories. In 1950 Zhukov, along with a number of other senior officers, was reelected to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. In 1952 the second edition of the official Great Soviet Encyclopedia carried a short but favorable entry on Zhukov, stressing his important role in the realization of Stalin&#x2019;s military plans during the war. In October 1952 Zhukov was a delegate to the 19th Party Congress and he was restored to candidate (i.e., probationary) membership of the Central Committee. Incredibly, Zhukov believed that Stalin was preparing to appoint him minister of defense.<br><br>In March 1953 Stalin died and Zhukov was a prominent member of the military guard of honor at the dictator&#x2019;s state funeral. Zhukov&#x2019;s appointment as deputy minister of defense was among the first announcements made by the new, post-Stalin Soviet government. Zhukov&#x2019;s rehabilitation continued apace with his appointment in February 1955 as minister of defense by Khrushchev, Stalin&#x2019;s successor as party leader. In July 1955 Zhukov attended the great power summit in Geneva of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States&#x2014;the first such gathering since the end of the war. There he met and conversed with President Dwight Eisenhower, with whom he had served in Berlin just after the war. &#x201c;Could the friendship of two old soldiers,&#x201d; wondered Time magazine, &#x201c;provide the basis for a genuine easing of tensions between the U.S. and Russia?&#x201d;<br><br>As minister of defense, Zhukov emerged as a prominent public figure in the Soviet Union, second only in importance to Khrushchev. In June 1957 Zhukov played a pivotal role in resisting an attempt to oust Khrushchev from the leadership by a hard-line faction led by Vyacheslav Molotov, the former foreign minister. Unfortunately for Zhukov his bravura performance in the struggle against Molotov turned him into a political threat in Khrushchev&#x2019;s eyes. In October 1957 Zhukov was accused of plotting to undermine the role of the Communist Party in the armed forces. Among Zhukov&#x2019;s most active accusers were many of the same generals and marshals he had served with during the war. Khrushchev sacked Zhukov as minister of defense and in March 1958 he was retired from the armed forces at the relatively young age of sixty-one.<br><br>During the remainder of the Khrushchev era Zhukov suffered the same fate of excision from the history books he had experienced during his years of exile under Stalin. In 1960, for example, the party began to publish a massive multivolume history of the Great Patriotic War that barely mentioned Zhukov while greatly exaggerating Khrushchev&#x2019;s role. Another expression of Zhukov&#x2019;s disgrace was his isolation from the outside world. When American author Cornelius Ryan visited the USSR in 1963 to research his book on the battle of Berlin, Zhukov was the only Soviet marshal he was prohibited from seeing.<br><br>Zhukov took solace in writing his memoirs. His authorial role model was Winston Churchill, whose memoir-history of the Second World War he had read when a restricted-circulation Russian translation was published in the USSR in the 1950s. Churchill&#x2019;s motto in composing that work was that history would bear him out&#x2014;because he was going to write the history! Zhukov seems to have harbored similar sentiments and his memoirs were designed not only to present his own point of view but to answer and refute his Khrushchevite critics, even if that meant skewing the historical record in his own favor.<br><br>While Khrushchev continued to rule the Soviet Union there was no chance Zhukov&#x2019;s memoirs would be published. When his daughter Ella asked him why he bothered he said he was writing for the desk drawer. In October 1964, however, Khrushchev was ousted from power and there began a process of rehabilitating Zhukov as a significant military figure. Most notably, the Soviet press began to publish Zhukov&#x2019;s articles again, including his accounts of the battles of Moscow, Stalingrad, Kursk, and Berlin.<br><br>Zhukov&#x2019;s second rehabilitation rekindled interest in him in the West, which had faded somewhat after he was ousted as defense minister. In 1969 the American journalist and historian Harrison E. Salisbury published an unauthorized translation of Zhukov&#x2019;s articles in a book called Marshal Zhukov&#x2019;s Greatest Battles. In his introduction to the volume Salisbury famously described Zhukov as &#x201c;the master of the art of mass warfare in the 20th century.&#x201d; Most reviewers agreed. John Erickson, the foremost British authority on the Red Army, writing in The Sunday Times, said &#x201c;the greatest soldier so far produced by the 20th century is Marshal Georgi Zhukov of the Soviet Union. On the very simplest reckoning he is the general who never lost a battle. . . . For long enough the German generals have had their say, extolling their own skills . . . now it is the turn of Marshal Zhukov, a belated appearance to be sure but the final word may be his.&#x201d;<br><br>When Zhukov&#x2019;s memoirs were published in April 1969 it was in a handsome edition with colored maps and hundreds of photographs, including some from Zhukov&#x2019;s personal archive. The Soviet public was wildly enthusiastic about the memoirs. The initial print run of 300,000 soon sold out and millions more sales followed, including hundreds of thousands in numerous translations. The memoirs quickly became&#x2014;and remain&#x2014;the single most influential personal account of the Great Patriotic War.</p><h2>Whole Prayer</h2><p>Suggests that Christians are often spiritually hungry because their prayers are monologues and not true conversations with God, and explains how to make prayer a dialogue</p><p>Prayer was meant to be as natural as breathing--our response to need, frustration, joy, and all the events and encounters of our lives. But many of us feel our prayer life is a mere shadow of the wholeness and fullness we were meant to experience. Perhaps it&#39;s because we don&#39;t understand that prayer is about talking with God, not just to him. Not just sharing our hearts with him, but listening as he opens his heart to us. Award-winning author Walter Wangerin gracefully explores the dynamics of prayer, of speaking, of listening, of waiting, of hearing God&#39;s voice. Whole Prayer helps us reach toward God and learn to receive from God, knowing that we are held and encircled by the presence of a loving Heavenly Father.Walter Wangerin Jr. first came to prominence as the award-winning author of The Book of the Dun Cow. He has since won many other awards and honors for his books, which include The Book of God, Reliving the Passion, Mourning into Dancing, Ragman and Other Cries of Faith, As for Me and My House, The Manger Is Empty, Little Lamb Who Made Thee? and The Book of Sorrows. His book Miz Lil and the Chronicles of Grace has been adapted as a screenplay by the award-winning writer Horton Foote.

It was not her own alarm. The emotion was the natural reaction of all those gathered to see Valin and his sister, Jysella, rescued from an unfair, unwarranted sentence imposed not by a court of justice, but by Galactic Alliance Chief of State Daala herself. Had they come to see these Jedi Knights freed and instead become witness to a tragedy?<br><br>But what Cilghal didn&#x2019;t feel in the Force was the winking out of a life. Valin was still there, a diminished but intact presence in the Force.<br><br>She waved at the assembly, a calming motion. &#x201c;Be still.&#x201d; She did not need to exert herself through the Force. Most of those present were Jedi Masters and Jedi Knights who respected her authority. Not one of them was easily panicked, not even the little girl beside Han and Leia.<br><br>Standing between Valin&#x2019;s and Jysella&#x2019;s hovergurneys with her assistant Tekli, Cilghal concentrated on the young man lying to her right. His body gleamed with a trace of dark fluid: all that remained of the melted carbonite that had imprisoned him. He was as still as the dead. Cilghal pressed her huge, webbed hand against his throat to check his pulse. She found it, shallow but steady.<br><br>The readout board flickered again and the lights came up in all their colors, strong, the pulse monitor flickering with Valin&#x2019;s heartbeat, the encephaloscan beginning to jitter with its measurements of Valin&#x2019;s brain activity.<br><br>Tekli, a Chadra-Fan, her diminutive size and glossy fur coat giving her the aspect of a plush toy instead of an experienced Jedi Knight and physician, spun away from Valin&#x2019;s gurney and toward the one beside it. On it lay Jysella Horn, slight of build, also gleaming a bit with unevaporated carbonite residue. Tekli put one palm against Jysella&#x2019;s forehead and pressed the fingers of her other hand across Jysella&#x2019;s wrist.<br><br>Cilghal nodded. Computerized monitors might fail, but the Force sense of a trained Jedi would not, at least not under these conditions.<br><br>Tekli glanced back at Cilghal and gave a brisk nod. All was well.<br><br>The pulse under Cilghal&#x2019;s hand began to strengthen and quicken. Also good, also normal.<br><br>Cilghal moved around the head of the gurney and stood on the far side, a step back from Valin. When he awoke, his vision would be clouded, and perhaps his judgment as well. It would not do for him to wake with a large form standing over him, gripping his throat. Violence might result.<br><br>She caught the attention of Corran and Mirax, parents of the two patients. &#x201c;That was merely an electronic glitch.&#x201d; Cilghal tried to make her tones reassuring, knowing her effort was not likely to succeed&#x2014;Mon Calamari voices, suited to their larger-than-human frames, were resonant and even gravelly, an evolutionary adaptation that allowed them to be heard at greater distances in their native underwater environments. Unfortunately, they tended to sound harsh and even menacing to human ears. But she had to try. &#x201c;They are fine.&#x201d;<br><br>Corran, wearing green Jedi robes that matched the color of his eyes, heaved a sigh of relief. His wife, Mirax, dressed in a stylish jumpsuit in blacks and blues, smiled uncertainly as she asked, &#x201c;What caused it?&#x201d;<br><br>Cilghal offered a human-like shrug. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put the monitors in for evaluation once your children are checked out as stable. I suspect these monitors haven&#x2019;t been tested or serviced since Valin and Jysella were frozen.&#x201d; There, that was a well-delivered lie, dismissing the monitor&#x2019;s odd behavior as irrelevant.<br><br>Valin stirred. Cilghal glanced down at him. The Jedi Knight&#x2019;s eyes fluttered open and tried to fix on her, but seemed to have difficulty focusing.<br><br>Cilghal looked down at him. &#x201c;Valin? Can you hear me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I . . . I . . .&#x201d; Valin&#x2019;s voice was weak, watery.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t speak. Just nod.&#x201d;<br><br>He did.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>She was interrupted by a stage-whispered notification from Tekli: &#x201c;Jysella is awake.&#x201d;<br><br>Cilghal adjusted her angle so she could address both siblings. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been in carbonite suspension for some time. You feel cold, shaky, and disoriented. This is all normal. You are among friends. Do you understand me?&#x201d;<br><br>Valin nodded again. Jysella&#x2019;s &#x201c;yes&#x201d; was faint, but stronger and more controlled than Cilghal had expected.<br><br>&#x201c;Your parents are here. I&#x2019;ll allow them to speak to you in a moment. The Solos are here, as well.&#x201d; And little Amelia and her pet Anji, both of whom smell like they&#x2019;ve been rolling in seafood shells left rotting for a week. Cilghal had to blink over that fact. The child should have received a thorough disinfecting before being allowed in this chamber. Come to think of it, Barv also reeked. Where could a youngling and even a Jedi Knight go in the clean, austere Temple and end up smelling like that?<br><br>She set the question aside. &#x201c;Bazel Warv is here, and Yaqeel Saav&#x2019;etu, your friends. They can answer many questions about an ailment that afflicted the two of you just prior to your freezing.&#x201d;<br><br>Jysella looked around, barely raising her head, her attention sliding across the faces of friends and loved ones, and then she looked at Valin. He must have felt her attention; he looked back. A thought, the sort of instant communication that only siblings can understand, passed between them. Then the two of them relaxed.<br><br>Jysella looked again at her parents. &#x201c;Mom?&#x201d;<br><br>At Cilghal&#x2019;s nod, Mirax and Corran came forward, crowding into the gap between the hovergurneys. Tekli moved out of their way, circling the head of Valin&#x2019;s bed to rejoin Cilghal. She craned her neck to look up at the Mon Cal. &#x201c;All signs good.&#x201d;<br><br>Cilghal nodded. She turned to the others in the room. &#x201c;All but the immediate family, please withdraw to the waiting area.&#x201d;<br><br>And they did, exiting with words of encouragement and welcome.<br><br>In moments, only the Horns and the medics remained with Valin and Jysella. Cilghal took a few steps to the nurses&#x2019; station and its bank of monitoring screens, giving its more elaborate readouts a look . . . or pretending to. Tekli found a mist dispenser and sprayed its clean-smelling contents around the chamber, driving away reminders of Amelia&#x2019;s, Anji&#x2019;s, and Barv&#x2019;s recent presence. Then she rejoined her superior.<br><br>If Cilghal&#x2019;s predictions were correct, Valin and Jysella would be reaching full cognizance right about now, if they hadn&#x2019;t already. And if the madness that had caused them to be subjected to carbonite freezing was still in effect, their voices would be raised in moments with accusations: What have you done with my real mother, my real father?<br><br>That was the insanity that had visited them, the manifestation of the dark-side effect of their connection with the monster known as Abeloth. But recently, Abeloth&#x2019;s power over the &#x201c;mad Jedi&#x201d; had been broken. They had all returned to normal&#x2014;all but these young Horns, their recovery delayed by their suspended state.<br><br>Valin&#x2019;s voice was raised in a complaint, but it was not an accusation of treachery and deceit. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stop shaking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s normal.&#x201d; His father sounded confident. &#x201c;Han went through it years ago. He said it took him quite a while to warm up. This gurney is radiating a lot of heat, though. You&#x2019;ll be warm enough before you know it.&#x201d; He frowned. &#x201c;He also said his eyesight was gone right after he woke. How is it that you&#x2019;re seeing so well?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not.&#x201d; That was Jysella, raising her arms above her to stretch, an experiment that caused her to wince with muscle pangs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m seeing mostly with the Force.&#x201d;<br><br>Valin nodded. &#x201c;Me, too.&#x201d;<br><br>Cilghal and Tekli exchanged a glance. That was a relief. The conversation was idle chat, and would soon turn to minute discussions of who had been up to what while Valin and Jysella slept. All was well.<br><br>Unless . . . Cilghal still had one more test to run.<br><br>She raised her voice to catch the attention of all the Horns. &#x201c;Excuse me. I must interrupt. We have to let the monitors get several minutes of uninterrupted data, and all this talking is interfering. I must ask you two to withdraw for a while.&#x201d;<br><br>Mirax gave her an exasperated look. &#x201c;After all the time we&#x2019;ve waited&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Tekli held up a hand to forestall her. &#x201c;After all that time, you can afford to indulge in a few minutes of quiet relief with your husband.&#x201d; She made a shooing motion with her hands. &#x201c;Out.&#x201d;<br><br>Grudgingly, the older Horns withdrew. They&#x2019;d be joining the others in the waiting area.<br><br>From a cabinet, Cilghal took a pair of self-heating blankets. She approached the gurneys and spread one blanket over each patient. &#x201c;Tekli and I need to make some log entries about your recovery. Josat will be here in a moment&#x2014;ah.&#x201d; As if on cue, and it was indeed on cue, a teenage Jedi apprentice, cheerful and maddeningly energetic, entered the chamber. Red-haired, lean with a teen&#x2019;s overactive metabolism, he offered Cilghal and Tekli a minimally acceptable respectful nod and immediately moved over to the nurses&#x2019; station monitor to familiarize himself with his two charges.<br><br>Cilghal finished adjusting Jysella&#x2019;s blanket. &#x201c;If you need anything, Josat can provide it, and if he is not here, say &#x2018;Nurse&#x2019; and the comm router will put you in contact with the floor nurse.&#x201d;<br><br>Jysella glanced over at her brother. &#x201c;I have just been tucked in by a large fish.&#x201d;<br><br>He smiled, and when he spoke, there was amusement in his voice. &#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re hallucinating.&#x201d;<br><br>***<br><br>The waiting room was a long chamber decorated with plants from a dozen worlds and a wall-side fountain shaped to simulate a waterfall on the planet Alderaan, destroyed so long ago. The air here was fresher than that in the infirmary chambers, smelling of oxygen from the plants, mist from the waterfall&#x2014;<br><br>Fresher in most ways, fouler in others. Leia turned to Allana and crossed her arms. &#x201c;Sweetie . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, I know.&#x201d; The child did not sound at all child-like, but she hugged her pet nexu to her with what looked like a need for reassurance. &#x201c;We smell bad.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What did you get into?&#x201d;<br><br>Allana&#x2019;s shrug was uncommunicative. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br><br>Leia glanced at Barv, but the Ramoan Jedi Knight, big and green with ferocious tusks, avoided her eye.<br><br>Well, of course he didn&#x2019;t want to explain. He&#x2019;d been entrusted with watching over Allana, and he&#x2019;d failed to keep her out of mischief. This was the sort of humbling experience young Jedi needed to have from time to time.<br><br>Han leaned into the conversation, but his attention was on his wife, not his granddaughter. &#x201c;Garbage Compactor 3263827.&#x201d;<br><br>Leia scowled at him. &#x201c;Oh, shut up.&#x201d;<br><br>Han grinned, and there was a bit of mockery in the expression. He switched his attention to Allana. &#x201c;Sweetie, I can remember when your grandma smelled just like that. And unlike you, she was rude and ungrateful, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Han&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Go get cleaned up, and sanisteam Anji if you can, while your grandma and I discuss the impossibility of keeping children&#x2014;or teenage princesses&#x2014;clean.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Grandpa.&#x201d; Allana scurried while the scurrying was good. She didn&#x2019;t have to look back to detect the glare Leia was visiting on Han.<br>Cilghal and Tekli walked toward an office at the far end of the hall from the Horns&#x2019; chamber, just short of the waiting room.<br><br>Cilghal had Josat&#x2019;s script timed and running in her head. He would now be moving around the Horns&#x2019; chamber, humming to himself, cautioning Valin and Jysella not to move or talk&#x2014;the monitors needed stillness to do this evaluation&#x2014;but he could talk, fortunately, for it was impossible for him to keep quiet, or so his family said . . .<br><br>Tekli interrupted the holodrama in Cilghal&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;So what did cause the pod monitor to fail?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe what I said. And maybe it was a spike of the ability Valin manifested when he went mad.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The one that blanked out the encephaloscan?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. He was probably using the technique when he was frozen. The monitor failure would have been the last bit of that usage.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d; Tekli didn&#x2019;t comment. She didn&#x2019;t need to: Cilghal knew what she was thinking. Retention of that scanner-blanking ability was not an indication that Valin retained the madness, as well, but neither physician liked mysteries.<br><br>When the two of them entered their office, the main monitor on the wall was already tuned to a hidden holocam view of the Horns&#x2019; chamber. They could see Josat indeed bustling among the cabinets, assembling a tray full of beverages, receptacles for medicines, blood samples, swabs.<br><br>Tekli heaved a sigh. &#x201c;So far, so good.&#x201d;<br><br>Cilghal offered a noncommittal rumble. &#x201c;Time will tell.&#x201d;<br><br>Josat moved to Valin and then Jysella, offering drinks. His voice was crisp over the monitor speakers. &#x201c;We gave you the farthest room from the turbolifts and offices and waiting room. Much quieter here. If there&#x2019;s an emergency, though, it&#x2019;s safer to head to the stairs instead of the turbolifts. Right next door, take a left when you leave this chamber, it&#x2019;s the door straight ahead, you can find it in pitch darkness. That can be important. I never used to pay attention to things like that, but since I started studying nursing, I have to know these things. Jedi Tekli will make me run laps if I ever don&#x2019;t know where the emergency exits are from any of my stations. Were your Masters always assigning you exercise when you messed up? Don&#x2019;t answer, the monitors need quiet.&#x201d;<br><br>Cilghal blinked, pleased. &#x201c;He worked that in very well.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;About the punishment?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;About the stairs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br><br>Cilghal sighed. &#x201c;Mammalian humor. Deliberate misinterpretation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tends to drive a Master crazy, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br>Josat now stood beside Valin&#x2019;s gurney, his lightsaber swaying on his belt within Valin&#x2019;s easy reach. The apprentice eyed one of the wall monitors. &#x201c;Slow progress on your evaluation. No matter. Nobody will come back to bother you until it&#x2019;s run its course. Half an hour at least, I&#x2019;m guessing.&#x201d;<br><br>Cilghal nodded. &#x201c;The last of the bait. He is not a bad actor.&#x201d; Under ideal circumstances, Valin or Jysella might feel a trace of deceit from him through the Force, but now, still suffering a little from the aftereffects of carbonite freezing, they were unlikely to.<br><br>They were, however, likely to add up four important details. First, they were in a room at the end of the corridor, away from most visitors and medical personnel. Second, they were next to stairs that would allow them to reach any level of the Temple while bypassing well- traveled turbolifts. Third, they had half an hour before their absence would be noticed. And fourth, they had ready access to a lightsaber.<br><br>If they were still mad, and merely concealing the fact, could they resist the bait?<br><br>But neither Horn made a grab for the lightsaber.<br><br>If they had done so&#x2014;well, it wouldn&#x2019;t have been too damaging. The lightsaber would not have ignited. Switching it on, or having Cilghal or Tekli press a button on the comlinks they carried, would cause the false lightsaber to emit a powerful stunning gas. The Horns would have been felled without violence, never having even reached the corridor. Josat would have been felled as well, but it would have been easier on him than being thrashed by two experienced Jedi Knights.<br><br>But clearly, escape was not a priority for them. Which meant that they, too, were sane. Cured.<br>Valin had felt nothing but warmth and relief from his parents&#x2014;<br><br>From the man and woman masquerading as his parents.<br><br>As he lay listening to Josat&#x2019;s endless, ...</p><h2>Applied Kinesiology: A Training Manual and Reference Book of Basic Principles and Practices</h2><p>Applied kinesiology uses diagnostic muscle tests in conjunction with standard examination procedures to determine the causes of health problems.

The two, lyrics and music, have always been mutually dependent, in much the same way as a mannequin and a set of clothes are dependent on each other; separate them, and what remains is a naked dummy and a pile of cloth. Nevertheless, the exercise has been an interesting one, seeing, perhaps for the first time, how successfully the lyrics survive on their own and inviting the question as to whether song lyrics are in fact poetry or something else entirely. And while I've never seriously described myself as a poet, the book in your hands, devoid as it is of any musical notation, looks suspiciously like a book of poems. <br><br>So it seems I am entering, with some trepidation, the unadorned realm of the poet. I have set out my compositions in the sequence they were written and provided a little background when I thought it might be illuminating. My wares have neither been sorted nor dressed in clothes that do not belong to them; indeed, they have been shorn of the very garments that gave them their shape in the first place. No doubt some of them will perish in the cold cruelty of this new environment, and yet others may prove more resilient and become perhaps more beautiful in their naked state. I can't predict the outcome, but I have taken this risk knowingly and, while no one in their right mind should ever attempt to set "The Waste Land" to music, in the hopeful words of T. S. Eliot, &#x201c;<i>These fragments I have shored against my ruins</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;Sting<br>OUTLANDOS D'AMOUR (1978)<br><br>Next to You<br><br>So Lonely<br><br>Roxanne<br><br>Hole in My Life<br><br>Peanuts <br><br>Can't Stand Losing You <br><br>Truth Hits Everybody<br><br>Born in the '50s<br><br>*<br><br>Visions of the Night<br><br>Our first album as the Police was recorded piecemeal in a rundown studio above a dairy in Leatherhead. We had been together as a band for roughly a year by then. Some of the songs had been written for my previous band, Last Exit, and adapted for the new one. Others had been composed while touring, and some were created during rehearsals or while recording. <br><br>We weren't signed to a record company yet, and none of us had any money, so we used some secondhand tapes that we found in our manager's garage and recorded very late at night, for an even cheaper studio rate: moonlighting only after another band had left. <br><br>We'd work until the coffee ran out and we were bleary-eyed and delirious with exhaustion and the absurdity of our arguments.<br><br>I'd drive back to London in my battered old Citro�n in a kind of euphoria, with these tunes thundering in my head, yelling improvised lyrics at the top of my voice to the empty road and the stars twinkling sceptically above the rooftops.<br><br>I'd get back to my flat in Bayswater just as the sun was coming up through the trees in Hyde Park, thinking that these were some of the best days and weeks of my life. I'd try to scribble down whatever I'd been declaiming in the car and then go to sleep for the rest of the morning.<br><br>The afternoon would be spent trying to make sense of these fragments and working on them until early evening so that I would have something presentable that night.<br><br>I was happy because I'd dreamed about this, this making of an album, for as long as I'd owned a guitar, strummed my first chord, and rhymed my first couplet. It was almost too much to absorb.<br><br>There's no grand concept at work in this album, just a loose collection of dreams, fragments and fantasies, low doggerel and high dudgeon, sense and nonsense, anger and romance, all welded together by the bluff and bluster of a new band. <br><br>We were insane in our optimism, and we were never happier.<br>Next to You<br><br>I can't stand it for another day<br>When you live so many miles away<br>Nothing here is gonna make me stay<br>You took me over, let me find a way<br><br>I sold my house<br>I sold my motor, too<br>All I want is to be next to you<br>I'd rob a bank<br>Maybe steal a plane<br>You took me over<br>Think I'm goin' insane<br><br>What can I do<br>All I want is to be next to you<br>What can I do<br>All I want is to be next to you<br><br>I've had a thousand girls or maybe more<br>But I've never felt like this before<br>But I just don't know what's come over me<br>You took me over, take a look at me<br><br>What can I do<br>All I want is to be next to you<br>What can I do<br>All I want is to be next to you<br><br>All I want is to be next to you<br>All I want is to be next to you<br>All I want is to be next to you<br><br>So many times I used to give a sign<br>Got this feeling, gonna lose my mind<br>When all it is is just a love affair<br>You took me over, baby, take me there<br>What can I do<br>All I want is to be next to you<br>What can I do<br>All I want is to be next to you<br>What can I do<br>All I want is to be next to you<br>What can I do<br>All I want is to be next to you<br><br>All I want is to be next to you . . .<br><br>*****<br><br>I wrote these lyrics while I was in Last Exit and then grafted them shamelessly onto the chords from Bob Marley's "No Woman, No Cry." This kind of musical juxtaposition&#x2014;the lilting rhythm of the verses separated by monolithic slabs of straight rock and roll&#x2014;pleased the hell out of me. That we could achieve it effortlessly just added to the irony of a song about misery being sung so joyously.<br><br>It was something of a coup when someone pointed out to BBC television that, because of my poor diction, I seemed to be singing the name of a popular TV presenter, Sue Lawley, and not "So lonely." It was played on national television as an homage to Sue, but we didn't complain.

The band was staying in a seedy hotel near the Gare Saint-Lazare. I had a set of descending chords starting in G minor and a melancholy frame of mind.

Born into luxury, she lived in a whirl of beautiful homes, European vacations, exquisite clothing and handsome men. In <i>Searching for Beauty</i>, Cherie Burns chronicles Rogers's glittering life from her days as a young girl afflicted with rheumatic fever to her debutante debut and her Taos finale. A rebellious icon of the age, she eloped with a penniless baron, danced tangos in European nightclubs, divorced, remarried and romanced, among others, Clark Gable. Her romantic conquests, though, paled in comparison to her triumph in the fashion world where she electrified the fashionistas by becoming the muse to designer Charles James, appearing in Vogue and Harper's Bazaar and - at the end of her life - retreating to Taos, New Mexico where she popularized Southwestern style. With <i>Searching for Beauty</i>, Millicent Rogers enters the pantheon of great American women who, like Diana Vreeland and Babe Paley, put their distinctive stamp on American Style.</p></p><p><p>CHERIE BURNS is the author of <i>The Great Hurricane: 1938</i>. Her work has also appeared in The New York Times Magazine, People, Glamour, New York, and other publications. She lives in Taos, New Mexico.</p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><br><i>Farewell to an Heiress</i><br>&nbsp;<br><br>JANUARY 1953<br>The procession of mourners wound along the rutted unpaved road toward a weedy little graveyard next to Indian land. Behind it tolled the bells of Our Lady of Guadalupe Church in town; ahead of it rose Taos Mountain, the Sacred Mountain, all white with its peak hidden in the clouds. Brightly colored plastic flowers, indigenous to Spanish gravesites, bloomed from decorated crosses and gravestones in the high-desert resting place for local Spanish families and anglos. Millicent Rogers, in a manner as improbable yet fitting as so much of her unsettled life, was going home.<br>Taos, New Mexico, had long captivated artists, bohemians, scamps, and freethinking souls from elsewhere, who settled into its hive of quirky adobe houses at the feet of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Millicent Rogers had finally been one of them. She had been one of the most beautiful and richest women in America, perhaps the world. The toast of barons, industrialists, and royalty for almost five decades, she was known and admired in the fashion ateliers of Paris, London, and New York. Her face and fashions had appeared in <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar</i> all her life. She had loved a constellation of spectacular men. Now that the grand arc of her life had come to an end she was laid, as she requested, with her head facing Taos Mountain, next to the pueblo village and Indian people whom she had fallen nearly desperately in love with during the last six years of her life.<br>One mourner, the critic and writer William Goyen, wrote of the day,<br>The ceremony was a dreadful small-town ceremony in the graveyard produced by the local funeral home.... A sort of Muzak chimed a mawkish hymn. We all gathered round while the priest said his words, and a brilliant game rooster suddenly leapt to a fence just to one side of the grave and crowed. When the brief ceremony was over, Benito, the young Indian who had been in love with Millicent&#x2014;wild, with flowing black hair to his shoulders, and flowers in his hair, and bedecked with bracelets, necklaces, beads, and drunk&#x2014;and who had been held back, sullen and grief-stricken until now, rushed from the background and broke through the crowd toward the grave, crying out. But he was caught and held back by other Indians.1<br>Goyen&#x2019;s cosmopolitan eye noted that the funeral was attended by &#x201c;the rich and celebrated from various parts of the world.&#x201d; One English aristocrat, Dorothy Brett, got her car ahead of the hearse and out of grief or her own haphazard driving habit, zigzagged the whole procession along the road.<br>Millicent&#x2019;s three sons had come: the eldest, wearing a cutaway suit, was the product of her ill-fated elopement with an Austrian nobleman when she was twenty-one, the other two were sons from her second marriage to an Argentine aristocrat that had also ended in divorce. Millicent&#x2019;s mother, Mary Rogers, a dowager from the East Coast, had arrived after a three-day train trip in her own railroad car, a legacy from a life underwritten by an oil and railroad fortune that had also richly funded her daughter&#x2019;s stylish life. The funeral was postponed for several days to allow for her arrival. Mary had quietly asserted that under these circumstances the rail companies could accommodate her request to make the trip without a train change, and they had.<br>There was a certain incongruity for the writer Goyen, and perhaps to others on the scene, that these people of pedigree and wealth were gathered together to say their good-byes to a high-flying daughter, mother, friend, and lover as she was lowered into such a humble gravesite. Yet she had toward the end of her life taken refuge, sought peace and beauty, in elemental things. Her quest had led her to Taos. Though true happiness seemed always to elude her, Millicent claimed to her youngest son in a letter months before her death, an event she felt approaching at age fifty, that she was finally at peace. It would offer some comfort to her survivors.<br>Her life, like her funeral, had been distinctive, even unpredictable. During her time in Taos, she had deliberately befriended the Indians from the pueblo and they came to her funeral in numbers unprecedented to mourn the death of an outsider. Draped in the colorful blankets that they wore against the cold in winter and for celebrations, they appeared to bid her safe journey to the afterlife and farewell, in a rainbow of reds, blues, and yellows, their shiny black hair drawn back into buns and plaits, their heads bowed. They stood respectfully in a riot of color against the wide, Western winter sky.<br>Millicent was dressed as finely in her mahogany coffin as she had been in life. She wore an Apache-style dress made for her by her designer friend and fashion legend Elsa Schiaparelli. A great silver concho belt was twined at her waist. The large, mostly turquoise, rings that she favored were on her hands and a fine Indian chief blanket was wrapped around her. There was a brief Catholic ceremony. In a late life conversion, Millicent had become a Catholic the week before her death. After Benito&#x2019;s display of grief, most of the mourners looked away or hurried to their cars to leave.<br>For almost no one who left the Sierra Vista Cemetery on that day, had Millicent Rogers truly been put to rest. Her life and image would be reflected for decades to come through her vast belongings, words, old photographs, and history. She would be reinvented again and again by the fashion world, which she influenced in almost equal parts in life and after death. She cast a long shadow even from the grave on her family, and her three sons would variously strive to uphold, repudiate, and re-create her legend. With each subsequent year, her true self would seem to fade and grow faint, like a photograph exposed to the harsh New Mexican sun, while her heirs continued to retouch it. It would become more and more difficult to separate the truths of her life from the myth, especially because in life Millicent had been a restless soul, one who seldom stayed for long in one place. She was mistress of the grand gesture and exercised a practiced inscrutability, which no doubt accounted for much of her allure.<br>Her life arched over half a century of American history and across two continents. Born in the Edwardian era, she died just as the first signs of the upheaval of the sixties were visible on Taos&#x2019;s funky horizon. The beginning of her remarkable trajectory, like the origin of so many American sagas of the twentieth century, lay in the crystallization of wealth that produced great fortunes in the late 1800s. Her life and its trappings would have inspired an Edith Wharton heroine. With good looks, plenty of money, and a personal elegance that seemed to transcend both, she sampled life widely, but never fully invested. She was both a debutante and a flapper of the twenties, and she had no sooner come of age than she eloped with a titled European as the most daring daughters of great wealth did after the first World War. There were two more husbands and many more high-profile lovers as she lived the ex-patriot high life of Europe before World War II, and joined into the heady whirl of wartime Washington during the war. When the conflict ended, still recognized as a fashion trendsetter, she joined the new front of American glamour in Hollywood. There was a fling with the movie star Clark Gable, and then her constant quest for beauty in fashion, art, men&#x2014;all the world around her&#x2014;led her to Taos, where she found, finally, unexpected fulfillment. It was more than most women dream of, accomplished in five decades. Then at fifty she was dead.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2011 by Cherie Burns<br></p><h2>A Year by the Sea</h2><p>Now available in paperback, the entrancing story of how one woman's journey of self-discovery gave her the courage to persevere in re-creating her life.<br><br>Life is a work in progress, as ever-changing as a sandy shoreline along the beach. During the years Joan Anderson was a loving wife and supportive mother, she had slowly and unconsciously replaced her own dreams with the needs of her family. With her sons grown, however, she realized that the family no longer centered on the home she provided, and her relationship with her husband had become stagnant. Like many women in her situation, Joan realized that she had neglected to nurture herself and, worse, to envision fulfilling goals for her future. As her husband received a wonderful job opportunity out-of-state, it seemed that the best part of her own life was finished. Shocking both of them, she refused to follow him to his new job and decided to retreat to a family cottage on Cape Cod.<br>At first casting about for direction, Joan soon began to take plea-sure in her surroundings and call on resources she didn't realize she had. Over the course of a year, she gradually discovered that her life as an "unfinished woman" was full of possibilities. Out of that magical, difficult, transformative year came <b>A Year by the Sea</b>, a record of her experiences and a treasury of wisdom for readers.<br>This year of self-discovery brought about extraordinary changes in the author's life. The steps that Joan took to revitalize herself and rediscover her potential have helped thousands of woman reveal and release untapped resources within themselves.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Joan Anderson is the author of numerous children's novels, as well as <b>Breaking the TV Habit</b>. <b>A Year by the Sea</b> is her first venture into narrative nonfiction and her most personal work to date. Anderson lives with her husband on Cape Cod, where she conducts her popular "Year by the Sea" workshops.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>A touchy-feely finding-oneself memoir by a midlife woman who took a year off from her unfulfilling marriage and spent it in reflection by the sea. Anderson, a 50-year-old journalist and author of children's books (Harry's Helicopter,1990; 1787, 1987; etc.), refused to follow her husband when his job transferred him to another state, choosing instead to move alone to their summer cottage on Cape Cod and take stock of her life and marriage. Comparisons with Anne Morrow Lindbergh's Gift from the Sea are inevitable: both are by women concerned with the creative life, both express a closeness to nature at the seashore, a kinship with other life forms, a response to the ebb and flow of the tides, and both find metaphors in seashells. However, whereas Lindbergh has only a brief holiday at the beach and finds universal themes, Anderson's sojourn is protracted and her focus narrow. Alone, she is self-reliant and self-conscious, adventurous, resourceful, and open. Not all her time is spent in solitude, however: she works in a fish market for extra money, finds a mentor and companion in the widow of psychoanalyst Erik Erikson, has house guests, including an old friend, a psychoanalyst, and a priest, hires on as short-term cook for a nephew's film crew, and entertains her husband, sons, and daughters-in-law over Memorial Day. At the year's end, she is more certain of who she is and what she wants. She is ready to live once again with her husband, not in the old stale marriage, but in a new and still-to-be-defined one. A less-than-enthralling journey of self-discovery marred by more than a touch of self-congratulation. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now Arthur Bryant, John May, and their team of proud eccentrics have been given only one week to hunt down a murderer they&#x2019;ve already caught once&#x2014;and who is now luring them down into the darkest shadows of the London Underground.<br><br>The young man they seek is an enigma. His identity is false. His links to society are invisible. A search of his home yields no clues. The Peculiar Crimes Unit knows only this: Somehow Mr. Fox got out of a locked room and killed one of their best and brightest. Facing a shutdown, Bryant and May learn that their man, expertly disguised, has struck again in the world&#x2019;s oldest subway system. But as their search takes them into the vast labyrinth of tunnels that tie the city together, they discover a fresh mystery as bizarre as anything they have ever faced. . . .&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As the city blithely goes about its way, as tales of ghost stations and Underground legends emerge, Bryant and May, men of opposite methods, are each getting closer to what lies hidden at the heart of London&#x2019;s celebrated Tube&#x2014;and to the madness that is driving their man to murder.<br><br>Sophisticated, fast-paced, and confounding until its final twist, <b>Bryant &amp; May off the Rails</b> is Christopher Fowler dead on track and at the height of his power to beguile, bewitch, and entertain.</p><p>Christopher Fowler<b> </b>is the acclaimed author of sixteen previous novels, including the award-winning <b>Full Dark House</b><i> </i>and six other Peculiar Crimes Unit mysteries: <b>The Water Room, Seventy-Seven Clocks, Ten Second Staircase, White Corridor, The Victoria Vanishes</b>, and <b>Bryant &amp; May on the Loose</b><i>.</i> He lives in London, where he is at work on his next Peculiar Crimes Unit novel.<i>Chapter One<br>&nbsp;A Private Feud</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>CONFIDENTIAL FROM: THE DESK OF LESLIE FARADAY HOME OFFICE SENIOR POLICE LIAISON &nbsp; &nbsp; TO: RAYMOND LAND ACTING TEMPORARY HEAD PECULIAR CRIMES UNIT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Dear Raymond,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> With regard to your apprehension of the hired assassin operating in the King's Cross area, this so-called 'King's Cross Executioner' chap, thank you for acting so quickly on the matter, although it's a pity he subsequently managed to give you the slip.I had a bit of trouble opening your report because, frankly, computers have never been my strong point, but the new girl in our office seems to understand these things and printed out a copy for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Following the judicial review we decided to scrap the idea of holding a press conference, but we're speaking to our key contacts today, so we'll have some idea of the headlines likely to run in tomorrow's papers. Always talk to the press, I say, even whenyou've got nothing to tell them. We're hoping that a bit of publicity might flush him out. I'm trying to discourage sensational references to his nickname, without much luck, I'm sorry to say, but when a little boy finds a human head while fishing for eelsin a canal, you can expect the press to react strongly.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I have passed your conclusions on to my superior and other concerned department heads, and will return with their reactions in due course. I also have to acknowledge the receipt of an additional report on this case from one of your senior detectives, ArthurBryant, although I must admit I was only able to read portions of this document as Bryant's handwriting was extremely small and barely legible, and pages 23 through 31 had some kind of curry sauce spilled over them. Furthermore his account is opinionated andanecdotal in the extreme, and on several occasions, positively offensive. Could you have a word with him about this?&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Naturally we are all sorry to hear about what happened. It is always with great sadness that one hears of a police officer's demise in the course of his duty, especially in this case, when the officer in question was so highly regarded, and had such abright future ahead of him.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Although the tribunal was reasonably satisfied that no member of the Peculiar Crimes Unit could be held responsible for the unforeseen events occurring on your premises, we do not feel that full autonomy can be returned to the Unit until a series of regulatorysafeguards have been put in place to ensure that the impossibility of such an incident--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; 'Oh, for God's sake get on with it!' Arthur Bryant complained at the page, balling it up and disdainfully throwing it over his shoulder as he skipped to the final sheet. He had filched the report from Raymond Land's mailbox and was vetting it before theacting chief arrived for work. 'Let's see--"inadequate safeguards" yadda yadda yadda "irregular procedures" yadda yadda "unnecessary risk factors," all predictable stuff. Ah, here's the bit I was expecting--"because the perpetrator of these crimes was allowedto escape and is still at large, he remains a potential menace to society. Therefore we cannot consider fully reinstating the PCU until he is apprehended." In other words, catch him but don't expect us to help you with additional resources. Bloody typical.Oh, listen, you'll like this bit. "Due to the financial reorganisation of the Home Office's outsourced operations units, you have until the end of the week (Saturday at six p.m.) to conclude this and any other unfinished investigations in order to qualify forannual funding." So he wants us to achieve the impossible in less than one week or he and his ghastly boss Oskar Kasavian will cut us off without a penny. "Your Obedient Servant, Leslie Faraday." Who signs their letters like that anymore? Anyway, he's not ourObedient Servant, but I suppose he couldn't sign it Sad Porky Timeserver or Snivelling Little Rodent.'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>With increasing age, the grace notes of temperance, balance, harmony and gentility are supposed to appear in the human heart. This was not entirely true, however, in Arthur Bryant's case. He remained acidulous, stubborn, insensitive and opinionated. Inaddition, he was getting ruder by the day, as the byzantine workings of the British Home Office sucked away his enthusiasm for collaring killers.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Bryant started to crumple up the rest of the memo, then remembered he wasn't supposed to have seen it, and flattened it out imperfectly. He fished the other pages out of the bin, but now they were smeared with the remains of last night's fish and chips.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; 'I don't know why you get so het up, Arthur. What did you honestly expect?' John May carefully pinched his smart pin-striped trousers at the knee and bent to give him a hand picking up the pages. 'A man kills three times, is arrested by us, breaks outof a locked cell, stabs a police officer in the neck and vanishes. We were hardly going to be rewarded for our efforts.'&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> 'What about the innocent people we protected? The deaths we prevented?' Bryant demanded, appalled.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; 'I think they're happier counting the millions of pounds we saved them.' May rose, twisted his chair and flopped down, stretching himself into a six-foot line. 'Just think of all the companies that would have pulled out if we hadn't been able to securethe area.'&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; 'What a case for my memoirs,' Bryant muttered. 'Three mutilated bodies found on the mean streets of King's Cross. Murders committed solely for financial gain by a slippery, adaptable thief who's grown up in the area around the terminus, a small-time crookpropelled to the status of murderer when a robbery went wrong. You know what's happened, don't you? For the first time in his life this Mr Fox has been made to feel important. The escalation of his criminal status, from burglar to hired killer, has increasedhis determination to stay free.'&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> There was a darkness at the heart of this chameleon-like killer that the members of the Peculiar Crimes Unit had underestimated. For a while it had felt as if gang war was breaking out in the area, but by getting to the root of the crimes, the detectiveshad managed to soothe public fears and reassure investors that the newly developing region was still open for business. In the process, however, they had lost an officer, and had been unable to stop their quarry from escaping back into the faceless crowds.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Bryant pottered over to the sooty, rain-streaked window and tapped it. 'He's still out there somewhere,' he warned, 'and now he'll do one of two things. Having had his fingers badly burned, he'll either vanish completely, never to be seen again, or he'llreturneth like a dog to vomit, just to taunt me further. Proverbs chapter twenty-six, verse eleven.' &nbsp; 'I don't understand,' said May. 'Why are you taking this so personally?'&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> 'Because I'm the one he's after. DuCaine just got in the way.' Bryant had never exhibited much empathy with his co-workers, but this struck May as callous even by his standards.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Liberty DuCaine's parents have just lost a son, Arthur, so perhaps you could keep such thoughts to yourself. Don't turn this into a private feud. It concerns all of us.' May rose and left the room in annoyance.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Bryant was sorry that the lad had died--of course he was upset--but nothing could bring DuCaine back now, and the only way they could truly restore order was by catching the man responsible for his murder. With a sigh he popped open his tobacco tin andstuffed a pipe with 'Old Arabia' Navy Rough-Cut Aromatic Shag. His gut told him that Mr Fox would quickly resurface, not because the killer had any romantic longing to be stopped, but because his rage would make him careless. His sense of respect had been compromised,and he was determined to make the police pay for cornering him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> I'll get you, sonny, Bryant thought, because I owe it not just to DuCaine, but to every innocent man, woman and child out there who could become another of your statistics. You'll turn up again, soon enough. You've tasted blood now. The need to let otherssee how big you've grown will drive you back out into the light. When that happens, I'll have you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Unfortunately, Bryant tried to avoid reminding himself, it would need to happen this week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Chapter Two<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Choreography</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> DC Colin Bimsley and DC Meera Mangeshkar were watching the train station. They had no idea what their suspect might look like, or any reason to assume he would appear suddenly before them on the concourse. But Mr Fox knew his terrain well and rarely leftit, so there was a chance that even now he might be wandering through the Monday morning commuters. And as the St Pancras International surveillance team was more concerned with watching for terrorist suspects after a weekend of worrying intelligence, it fellto the two detective constables to keep an eye out for their man. At least it was warm and dry under the great glass canopy.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Each circuit of the huge double-tiered terminus took half an hour. Bimsley and Mangeshkar wore jeans and matching black nylon jackets with badges, the closest anyone at the PCU could come to an official uniform, but Bimsley was a foot taller than his partner,and they made an incongruous pair.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Down there.'

There&#x2019;s Willard Russell, tormented veteran of the carnage in the South Pacific, who can&#x2019;t save his beautiful wife, Charlotte, from an agonizing death by cancer no matter how much sacrifi�cial blood he pours on his &#x201c;prayer log.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s Carl and Sandy Henderson, a husband-and-wife team of serial kill�ers, who troll America&#x2019;s highways searching for suitable models to photograph and exterminate. There&#x2019;s the spider-handling preacher Roy and his crippled virtuoso-guitar-playing sidekick, Theodore, running from the law. And caught in the middle of all this is Arvin Eugene Russell, Willard and Charlotte&#x2019;s orphaned son, who grows up to be a good but also violent man in his own right. <br> <br>Donald Ray Pollock braids his plotlines into a taut narrative that will leave readers astonished and deeply moved. With his first novel, he proves himself a master storyteller in the grittiest and most uncompromising American grain.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, July 2011</strong>: With <i>The Devil All the Time</i>, author Donald Ray Pollock has crafted an exceptionally gritty, twisted page-turner. This follow-up to 2008's <i>Knockemstiff</i> is set in the Midwest during the mid-century, but reads more like a gothic Western. Lawlessness roams the rural, god-fearing landscape of Ohio and West Virginia, inhabitated by the likes of Pollock's deranged-yet-compelling cast of characters--a husband and wife who take vacations to murder hitchhikers, a faux preacher and his crippled accomplice on the lam for manslaughter, and an orphan with a penchant for exacting violent justice. Needless to say, <i>The Devil All the Time</i> is a brutal novel, but Pollock exacts the kind of precision and control over his language that keeps the violence from ever feeling gratuitous. The three storylines eventually converge in a riveting moment that will leave readers floored and haunted. <em>--Kevin Nguyen</em><b>DONALD RAY POLLOCK</b>, recipient of the 2009 PEN/Robert Bingham Fellowship, made his literary debut in 2008 with the critically acclaimed short story collection <i>Knockemstiff</i>.

These hidden messages which ranged from the esoteric to the political to the religious could be communicated in everything from the position of a hand to the placement of the sun and moon. <i>The Secret Language of the Renaissance</i> helps us discover them anew, as lecturer, author, and director Richard Stemp teaches you the art of reading these paintings.&nbsp;Magnificently illustrated throughout, and with a six-color gold-foil cover, this remarkable book has three distinct parts. The first surveys the literature, painting, sculpture, architecture, and decorative arts of this remarkable period. Section two reviews the essential elements of symbolic language in Renaissance art, including the use of color, geometry, light and shade, composition, proportion, perspective, and body language; the explanatory examples reach from Crivelli&#x2019;s <i>Annunciation</i> to Donatello&#x2019;s <i>Mary Magdalene</i>.

What has been recovered throws new light on the children's books and asks us to question our assumptions about the suposedly staid and sentimental Alcott. <br><br><i>Alternative Alcott </i>includes works never before reprinted, including "How I Went Out to Service," "My Contraband," and "Psyche's Art." It also contains <i>Behind a Mask</i>, her most important sensation story; the full and correct text of her last unfinished novel, <i>Diana and Persis</i>; "Transcendental Wild Oats"; <i>Hospital Sketches</i>; and Alcott's other important texts on nineteenth-century social history. This anthology brings together for the first time a variety of Louisa May Alcott's journalistic, satiric, feminist, and sensation texts. Elaine Showalter has provided an excellent introduction and notes to the collection.</p><p>Alcott's pseudonymous sensation stories have only recently been discovered; along with her adult novels, historical and feminist essays, and memoir of the failed communal experiment that was her childhood, they show us that there was indeed and "alternative Alcott." This volume reprints much of Alcott's "alternative" fiction, including the satirical Transcendental Wild Oats. Though brilliant, Showalter's introduction is at times excessively Freudian and speculative; literature can and must stand on its own. Still, this is a highly pertinent anthology.

He awakens with no memory of who he is or why he was shot-and Bourne is eerily reminded of his own amnesia. Then Bourne discovers that the Mossad agent named Rebeka is so determined to find this injured man that she has gone off the grid, cut her ties to her agency, and is now being stalked by Mossad's most feared killer. Do the answers to these mysteries lie back in southeast Lebanon, in a secret encampment to which Bourne and Rebeka escaped following a firefight weeks ago?<br>The complex trail links to the mission given to Treadstone directors Peter Marks and Soraya Moore: find the semi-mythic terrorist assassin known as Nicodemo.<br>In the course of Bourne's desperate, deadly search for a secret that will alter the future of the entire world, he will experience both triumph and loss, and his life will never be the same.<br>Now everything turns on the amnesiac.

Whether it's a blocked circumflex artery or a plan to land a massive malpractice suit, he knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men.<br><br>Pietro "Bearclaw" Brnwna is a hitman for the mob, with a genius for violence, a well-earned fear of sharks, and an overly close relationship with the Federal Witness Relocation Program.

Currently a resident at the University of California, San Francisco, he wrote <i>Beat the Reaper</i> while completing his internship at a hospital not at all like the one described in this book.Author Josh Bazell and narrator Robert Petkoff prove to be an effective pair with this work, which will entertain listeners from beginning to end. Bazell&#39;s attention to character detail and plot twists creates an impressive work, all the more promising as this is his debut novel. Petkoff becomes central character Peter Brown, a onetime Mob hitman who is trying to rearrange his existence into something resembling a normal life. Brown is wry and intense, and Petkoff never fails to capitalize on the weighty prose that seems to come so easily to Bazell. The narrative performance benefits from the polished aesthetics of the production.

The Africa Bell knew is now long gone and seemingly very far away, but, in reality, his travels took place only about a century ago. Join us as Bell takes us to a land with vast herds of wildlife living in rough equilibrium with the native human populations. Through his earlier books Bell gained the reputation for being an excellent marksman who shot small-caliber guns at giant elephants with deadly precision. Bell was best known for his exploits in Karamoja, in what is now largely Uganda, and in these newly unearthed short stories, we again find him in familiar terrain and with his faithful retinue of trackers and camp followers. We also find Bell in unfamiliar terrain. Travel with Bell to the French Congo where he encounters a man-eating leopard, and go along with him to West Africa when he ventures into the rain forest with the Pygmies to test his luck against elephants in dense vegetation. Then there are some wonderfully descriptive stories of an elephant camp and its social life, crocodiles that menace a village, several hunts for elephants on islands in the Ubangi River (not for the faint of heart!), and a trip from Kano to Khartoum via motor car. These are just a few of our cache of new stories-original adventures never before published. Not only is Africa covered, but we also get a few stories on the calibers, bullets, rifles, and killing power needed for large game. In addition this book will be illustrated by photos and original line drawings by Walter Bell.</p><p></p><h2>The Game Before the Game: The Perfect 30-Minute Practice</h2><p><b>The authors of the smash hit Every Shot Must Have a Purpose put the golf back in golf practice, with a revolutionary approach that replaces rote sessions with dynamic, proven drills.</b> <br><br> As coaches to golf?s top players, Lynn Marriott and Pia Nilsson have created brilliant new mind- body strategies for every aspect of the game.

The remaining pollinators, essential to the cultivation of a third of American crops, are now trucked across the country and flown around the world, pushing them ever closer to collapse. <i>Fruitless Fall </i>does more than just highlight this growing agricultural catastrophe.

After taking a &#x201c;bee&#x2019;s-eye view&#x201d; of the complex and well-orchestrated workings of the hive, and reviewing the role this extraordinarily adaptable and productive European immigrant has played in North America&#x2019;s phenomenal agricultural fecundity, he documents the many ways we&#x2019;ve endangered the honeybee. We destroy wildflower habitats;&nbsp;truck&nbsp;bees cross-country to fertilize monocrops, especially California&#x2019;s half-million acres of almond trees;&nbsp;dose them with&nbsp;neurotoxin-laced pesticides; and&nbsp;overuse&nbsp;antibiotics. The upshot of Jacobsen&#x2019;s alarming expos� is that honeybees have been industrialized, just like cattle and poultry, and abused so severely hives are failing. But disaster can be averted if we revive our ancient, respectful, and mutually sustaining partnership with the miraculous honeybee. All it takes, he says,&nbsp;is our ability to work with nature, not against it. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>40 Knots to Know: Hitchs, Loops, Bends and Binding (Quick Starts for Kids!)</h2><p>Provides step-by-step instructions for tying five basic knots plus a variety of more complex ones, including joining knots, bindings, coils, hitches, lashings, and more.</p><p>Grade 4-7-Scouts, campers, anglers, and sailors are just some of the people who will find this title useful. Introductory pages list and define types of knots and terminology, and a quiz helps readers decide what type of knot to use for specific kinds of tasks. The chapter on "Fab Five Knots" notes uses and provides directions for square, two half hitches, figure-eight, bowline, and sheet bend knots, one of which is likely to be appropriate for any situation in which a knot is needed. Practicing tying, even in the dark, is continually emphasized. The step-by-step directions and diagrams with directional arrows are helpful.

The rest of the selections are grouped by their purposes: knots for coiling, shortening, ending, binding, bending, joining, looping, hitching, and lashing. A short description of the knot and its uses precedes each set of clear, step-by-step instructions. The mildly comical drawings give the pages child appeal; numerous line drawings clearly demonstrate each step in tying every knot. A practical, accessible handbook for young people who are campers, climbers, sailors, or scouts, not to mention adults who wish they could remember the right way to tie the trunk down. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A tireless investigator, Griffin has sorted through enormous amounts of government and independent data and brought to the surface some very unsettling inconsistencies about what really happened. In this, his latest book, he analyzes the evidence on 9/11 and then explores a distinctively Christian perspective on these issues, taking seriously what we know about Jesus' life, death, and teachings. Drawing a parallel between the Roman Empire of antiquity and the American Empire of today, he applies Jesus' teachings to the current political administration, and he explores how Christian churches, as a community intending to be an incarnation of the divine, can and should respond.</p></p><p>"WARNING: If, like most Americans calling themselves Christian, you prefer the comfort of acquiescing to the official version of 9/11 and the imperial wars it facilitated, DROP THIS BOOK NOW. But if you are open to the grace of honest inquiry and the risk of following the historical Jesus in confronting the evils of empire, this rigorously argued book is a MUST READ." <p>&#x2014;Ray McGovern, CIA veteran analyst now with Tell the Word, a project of the ecumenical Church of the Saviour, Washington, D.C. </p><p>"David Griffin has previously made the case for the Bush administration&#x2019;s complicity in 9/11 and the cover-up of this evidence by the 9/11 Commission.

In a profound exploration of the nature and history of the demonic, Griffin suggests that American empire is a culmination of human demonic alienation from God." </p><p>&#x2014;Rosemary Radford Ruether, emeritus scholar, Claremont Graduate University and Claremont School of Theology </p><p>"Do American Christians want the United States to act like the New Rome, invading other countries to impose its imperial rule and its control of other peoples&#x2019; resources? That is just what the U.S. is doing, increasingly so since 9/11, explains David Griffin. In this gripping summary of evidence for the truth behind 9/11 and the 9/11 Commission report, Griffin makes a compelling case that the imperial practices of the American government have become a destructive force in the world. And he clarifies the biblical and theological basis for Christians to challenge the resurgent American imperialism that often claims divine blessing on its destructive actions." </p><p>&#x2014;Richard A.

Frank Baum: Creator of Oz: A Biography</h2><p>Since it was first introduced over a hundred years ago in <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>, L. Frank Baum's world of Oz has become one of the most enduring and beloved creations in children's literature. It has influenced numerous prominent writers and intellectuals, and become a lasting part of the culture itself.<br> <br>L. Frank Baum was born in 1856 in upstate New York, the seventh child of a very successful barrel-maker and later oil producer. However, Baum's own career path was a rocky one. Beginning as an actor, Baum tried working as a traveling salesman, the editor of a small town newspaper and the publisher of a trade journal on retailing, failing to distinguish himself in any occupation. His careers either failed to provide a sufficient living for his beloved wife Maud and their children or were so exhausting as to be debilitating. In the 1890's, L. Frank Baum took the advice of his mother-in-law, suffragist leader Matilda Gage, and turned his attention to trying to sell the stories he'd been telling to his sons and their friends. After a few children's books published with varying success, he published <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz </i>in 1900 and it quickly became a bestseller and has remained so ever since.<br><br>In this first full-length adult biography of Baum, Rogers discusses some of the aspects that made his work unique and has likely contributed to Oz's long-lasting appeal, including Baum's early support of feminism and how it was reflected in his characters, his interest in Theosophy and how it took form in his books, and the celebration in his stories of traditional American values. Grounding his imaginative creations, particularly in his fourteen Oz books, in the reality of his day, Katharine M. Rogers explores the fascinating life and influences of America's greatest writer for children.<br></p><p>Katharine M. Rogers helped establish women's studies programs at Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center. She has published five books and edited four anthologies of 18th- and 19th-century literature. She is married with three grown children, and lives in Maryland.<br><i>one</i>EARLY LIFE: ACTOR, PLAYWRIGHT, OIL SALESMAN, 1856-1888Lyman Frank Baum was born on May 15, 1856, in a frame house in Chittenango, fifteen miles east of Syracuse, New York. He was the seventh child of Cynthia Stanton and Benjamin Ward Baum. The others were Harriet Alvena (born in 1846), Mary Louise (1848), Benjamin William (1850), and three who had died young. Three years after Lyman Frank, Henry Clay Baum was born. A ninth child lived only until the age of two.Benjamin was descended from Philipp Baum of Hesse, who settled in central New York in 1748. Benjamin&#x2019;s father had been a prosperous storekeeper, but he lost his money and became a Methodist lay preacher. Benjamin, his oldest son, started life as a barrel maker. He moved to New Woodstock, where he met Cynthia Stanton, the daughter of a prosperous farmer. Oliver Stanton did not consider Benjamin a suitable son-in-law, so the two young people eloped and married in 1842, when both were twenty-one.The young barrel maker turned out to be an enterprising and astute businessman. Although he suffered periodic reverses and was forced to mortgage or sell property, he always recovered up to the time that he became chronically ill. He embarked on one business after another until he became a wealthy man. By 1850, he was a partner in a pump-vending business in Cazenovia with his wife&#x2019;s brother, as well as being listed in the city directory as a manufacturer of butter and cheese. In 1854, the Baums moved to Chittenango, where Benjamin&#x2019;s sister lived with her husband and their parents. He bought considerable land there, on which he built the family home and a barrel factory. A business directory of 1859 lists Baum Brothers (Benjamin and Lyman), Manufacturers of Tight Barrels (for liquids) and Butter Firkins. In the 1860 census, Benjamin&#x2019;s real estate holdings were valued at six thousand dollars, and &#x201c;Frankie&#x201d; was listed among his family members. Lyman Frank had already succeeded in shedding the first name he disliked.In 1859, oil was discovered in Titusville, Pennsylvania, about two hundred miles from Syracuse. Benjamin recognized a splendid opportunity and joined the crowds who moved in to exploit the oil fields and develop the area. A hundred new wells were drilled every month, ingenious mechanical contrivances were invented, towns and cities were built, &#x201c;with schools, churches, lyceums, theatres, libraries, boards of trade. There were nine daily and eighteen weekly newspapers published in the region and supported by it.&#x201d;1Benjamin began acquiring oil fields, including a particularly profitable one at Cherry Tree Run, a few miles south of Titusville. He later bought property between Bradford, Pennsylvania, and Olean, New York, where he helped to develop the hamlet of Gilmour and built a hotel and an opera house. In 1860, he moved his family to a handsome house in Syracuse. He was listed in the city directory of 1864 as a &#x201c;Dealer in Petroleum Oil.&#x201d; But he had other interests as well. He dealt extensively in real estate&#x2014;city houses and lots, farms, a sawmill with adjacent timberland. He traded stocks and had an office in New York City. He established the Second National Bank in Syracuse in 1863 and was its director or president until 1872. In 1866, he organized Neal, Baum &amp; Company, Wholesale Dry Goods, probably to provide a business for his daughter Harriet&#x2019;s new husband, William Henry Harrison Neal. Benjamin also took responsibility for finding work for his younger brothers, as well as, when the time came, his son Frank.In 1866, when Frank was ten, his father bought a delightful country estate just north of Syracuse, although they retained their house in the city for two years. Cynthia named the new property Rose Lawn because of the hundreds of rose bushes that grew there. There were also a wide variety of fruit trees and grapevines. The house was large and comfortable, furnished in the dark, ornate style that was fashionable in the 1860s; but it did not have running water.2 Frank fondly remembered this childhood home and later described it in <i>Dot and Tot of Merryland:</i> <br>The cool but sun-kissed mansion ... was built in a quaint yet pretty fashion, with many wings and gables and broad verandas on every side. Before it were acres and acres of velvety green lawn, sprinkled with shrubbery and dotted with beds of bright flowers. In every direction were winding paths, covered with white gravel, which led to all parts of the grounds, looking for all the world like a map.3<br>At the same time, Benjamin bought Spring Farm, eighty acres of dairy land adjoining Rose Lawn, where he raised Jersey cattle and fast harness horses and housed them in a magnificent barn, as well as a 160-acre commercial grain and livestock farm. Frank got his first view of scarecrows, which even then he invested with life. He told a reporter in 1904: &#x201c;They always seemed to my childish imagination as just about to wave their arms, straighten up and stalk across the field on their long legs.&#x201d;4 In those days the image was upsetting; Frank had a recurrent nightmare in which a scarecrow chased him but collapsed into a pile of straw just before catching him.5In the late 1870s, Benjamin ran into business difficulties. There was no longer unlimited free enterprise in the oil fields, for John D. Rockefeller had moved in and was increasingly controlling distribution. In 1878, Benjamin organized a group of independent producers to break Rockefeller&#x2019;s grip by building a pipeline from Bradford to Rochester, where the oil could be transferred to tank cars and shipped to refineries in New York and Buffalo; but the Standard Oil Company used its influence with the New York Central Railroad and the state legislature to block the plan. At about this time, Baum also suffered severe losses on the stock market. He had to sell Rose Lawn and his stock farm in 1880, although the family was soon able to buy it back. In 1882, he completed his recovery by discovering some productive oil wells near Olean, New York, and building the Cynthia Oil Works nearby. 6Although he had brothers and sisters to play with, Frank spent much of his time daydreaming by himself. He had a defective heart, either congenital or the result of rheumatic fever. This disease, which was then quite common, produces acute illness, which abates but may leave the patient with damaged heart valves; over decades the valves function less and less effectively, although there may be no perceptible effects until the patient develops incapacitating heart symptoms some time between the ages of forty and sixty. This is consistent with Baum&#x2019;s experience: he was sickly as a child, recovered, and led a normal, active life until his late fifties (although extraordinary physical stress did give him chest pain).7Until the age of twelve, Frank, like the other Baum children, was taught at home. At that time the doctors declared him strong enough to attend school, and his parents sent him to Peekskill Military Academy. It seems an odd choice for a dreamy boy with a weak heart; presumably they felt a need to make him more manly. In any case, he loathed the rigid discipline and constantly &#x201c;complained to my father about the brutal treatment I felt I was receiving at the school.&#x201d; The teachers, he claimed, &#x201c;were heartless, callous and continually engaging in petty nagging ... about as human as a school of fish.&#x201d; They &#x201c;were quick to slap a boy in the face&#x201d; and beat him with a cane if he &#x201c;violated in the slightest way any of the strict and often unreasonable rules.&#x201d; Frank spent two miserable years there, but one day, when he was severely disciplined for looking out of the window at the birds while he should have been preparing his lesson, he had a heart attack (probably psychogenic). Thus he proved that he did not belong in military school, and Benjamin took him away. After that Frank was tutored at home. He read voraciously, especially the novels of Dickens, Thackeray, and Charles Reade, whose <i>Cloister and the Hearth</i> was one of his favorite books. Perhaps he was already attracted to the theater, for he liked to memorize passages from Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays.8One day when Frank was fourteen, his father took him along to his office in Syracuse, and Frank wandered off and saw a small printing shop. He was so fascinated by watching the old owner work that he lost track of time, and he resolved to become a printer or a newspaper man. Benjamin bought him a small press.9 There was a fad for amateur journalism at the time, and it was possible to buy a child a press with all the other necessary equipment for something between fifteen and fifty dollars. Once Frank had mastered the techniques and taught them to his younger brother, Harry, they decided to issue a monthly paper.The first issue of the <i>Rose Lawn Home Journal,</i> which is not extant, probably came out on October 20, 1870; more followed on November 20 and on July 1, August 1, and September 1, 1871. The <i>Journal</i> was filled with works by Frank and other members of his family, together with pieces drawn from national magazines and books. His father contributed the first installments of a &#x201c;History of the Oil Company,&#x201d; describing the beginning of the petroleum industry in Pennsylvania. His sister Mary Louise contributed at least two poems, one of which, &#x201c;To a Spray of Mignonette,&#x201d; he was to reprint and mock in <i>Aunt Jane&#x2019;s Nieces on Vacation.</i>The July 1 issue contains a mock pompous introduction by Frank and Harry, a story by Washington Irving taken from <i>Salmagundi,</i> a complimentary letter from &#x201c;A Neighbor&#x201d; (perhaps by Frank), riddles and jokes, &#x201c;To a Spray of Mignonette,&#x201d; a story called &#x201c;Three Curious Needles&#x201d; that looks borrowed, verses &#x201c;By the Editor&#x201d; on the &#x201c;Cardiff Giant,&#x201d; and seven advertisements, including one for the dry goods business run by his sister Harriet&#x2019;s husband. &#x201c;The True Origin of The Cardiff Giant&#x201d; makes fun of a current hoax that occurred on a farm only eight miles from Rose Lawn, where workmen unearthed a ten-and-a-half-foot stone figure; although it was actually a gypsum statue that a local con artist had buried almost a year before, many people took it for a petrified man from the race of giants described in the Bible, perhaps left behind by the Great Flood, and it had become a major tourist attraction. Already at fifteen, Frank displayed humorous invention in accounting for the giant&#x2019;s location and irony at the expense of credulous, moralizing believers. He and Harry advertised in the <i>Journal</i> that they could print &#x201c;cards, programmes, handbills, letterheads, billheads, etc.; at the lowest prices!&#x201d; And so they did, especially after Frank got a much better press in 1873. They did job printing, mainly for their uncle&#x2019;s firm.10 At some point Frank must have begun a novel, for he thanked his sister Harriet for approving it in his inscription to her copy of <i>Mother Goose in Prose</i>.Then Frank was drawn to another contemporary fad, stamp collecting. With his usual enthusiasm, he promptly established a journal, <i>The Stamp Collector</i>, a review of the latest stamps with criticism of other amateur papers that dealt with the subject; published an eleven-page <i>Baum&#x2019;s Complete Stamp</i> <i>Dealers&#x2019; Directory;</i> and joined with William Norris, a traveling salesman based in Albany, to form a mail-order business in foreign postage stamps. The <i>Directory</i> included advertisements, not only for Baum, Norris &amp; Company, Importing Dealers in Foreign Postage Stamps, and The Young American Job Printing Press, but for <i>The Empire</i>, &#x201c;a First Class Monthly Amateur Paper&#x201d; published by Baum and Alvord and the Empire Job Printing Office.11 The young entrepreneur was seventeen. Baum retained a lifelong interest in stamp collecting and had a good collection when he died.Frank and Harry Baum had pooled resources with Thomas G. Alvord Jr.&#x2014;a son of the lieutenant governor, who grew up to be a distinguished newspaperman&#x2014;and announced a monthly journal, <i>The Empire,</i> to contain &#x201c;poetry, literature, new stamp issues, amateur items, etc.&#x201d; Since no issues seem to have survived, this enterprise may never have materialized. The three boys were enrolled in the Syracuse Classical School and are listed in the school catalogue for 1873. Frank left after a year, and this was the end of his formal education.He had found yet another interest to keep him busy. Benjamin Baum had used some of his oil profits to acquire a string of small theaters in New York and Pennsylvania. Frank could see traveling companies performing there when he accompanied his father on business trips. His Uncle Adam Baum was active in amateur theatricals in Syracuse, and his Aunt Katherine taught elocution professionally. At eighteen, Frank took to haunting the theaters in Syracuse, avidly studying the actors&#x2019; stage business, speech, and gestures. He approached several managers of traveling companies without success, but finally the manager of a Shakespearean troupe claimed to see promise in this well-dressed and very young man, and accepted him into the company provided he &#x201c;would equip himself with a complete set of costumes for all the starring roles he might be called upon to take.&#x201d; Frank agreed and the manager drew up a long list. Although Benjamin Baum was suspicious, Frank and his mother managed to persuade him to pay for the lot, on the condition that Frank use a pseudonym, since the name Baum was respected in the community. Frank ordered several thousand dollars&#x2019; worth of the finest velvet and silk garments, trimmed with lace and gold fringe, from a noted New York theatrical costumer. While he waited for delivery, he practiced declaiming Shakespeare.When the five trunks of costumes arrived, Frank assumed the stage name George Brooks and rushed to join the troupe at Oneida. The manager welcomed him warmly and told him to report to the theater an hour before curtain time. An actor appeared in Frank&#x2019;s dressing room, casually announced that he was to play Romeo and his doublet was torn, and asked whether he could borrow one from Frank. By curtain time almost every man in the cast had had a similar emergency and borrowed an item from Frank. Within a few days, all of his costumes and wigs had been borrowed, and none returned. He was given only a few walk-on roles, and after a few weeks he returned home with empty trunks. Presumably chastened, Frank, in 1875, went to work as a clerk with Neal, Baum &amp; Company, his brother-in-law&#x2019;s wholesale dry-goods store in Syracuse, as his brother had before him.12<br>After acquiring a year or two of practical experience working for Neal, Frank returned to Spring Farm to learn the agricultural business. (The oldest son, Benjamin William Baum, a graduate chemist with a laboratory in Syracuse, was to take over his father&#x2019;s oil investments.) This led to a new enthusiasm&#x2014;breeding of fancy poultry, which was then a national craze. He formed B. W. Baum &amp; Sons with his father and brother Harry and devoted himself to raising Hamburgs, black chickens with subtly varied secondary coloring. Then he helped found the Empire State Poultry Association in late 1878 and became its first elected secretary, organizing its first two annual fairs in Syracuse&#x2014;from February 11&#x2013;18, 1879, and from January 31-February 3, 1880. By this time, chickens from the Baum farm had won many first prizes in shows. At twenty-three Frank must already have impressed people as personable and competent, for when he attended the Seventh Annual Meeting of the American Poultry Association in Indianapolis in January 1880, he was elected to its executive committee.In March, he founded <i>The Poultry Record,</i> a trade journal issued monthly. ...</p><h2>Gangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields, and the New Politics of Latin America</h2><p><p>In a ranch south of Texas, the man known as The Executioner dumps five hundred body parts in metal barrels.

Now, featuring his vivid feel for the southwest, McGarrity's second gripping novel hurls Kerney onto the toughest case of his life. <p> Taking a job as a seasonal forest ranger in New Mexico's Gila Wilderness, Kevin Kerney is looking forward to a quiet summer high in the mountains. But the murder of a Mexican tourist, and the discovery of a disoriented old man in the wild, thrust Kerney into an investigation that will carry him back in time to a sixty-year-old feud between two land-rich brothers, Edgar and Eugene Cox. </p><p> Enlisting young state game and fish officer Jim Stiles to help solve the crimes, Kerney slowly uncovers evidence connecting the ruthless Cox feud with another suspicious death -- and the radical actions of New Mexico's present-day county militia. But new assistant district attorney Karen Cox -- Edgar's alluring daughter -- is torn between hiding her father's long-buried secret and helping Kerney find the truth. Now someone wants Kerney dead -- and the deeper he investigates, the more he may be digging his own grave.</p></p><p>With 1996's <i>Tularosa</i>, his first book about former New Mexico cop Kevin Kerney, onetime Santa Fe chief of detectives Michael McGarrity landed on lots of Top 10 lists and bedside tables.

Still recovering from the leg and stomach wounds he got at the end of <i>Tularosa</i>, Kerney is living in a rented house trailer and working as a temporary forest ranger in the Gila Wilderness in the southwest corner of New Mexico. All he wants to do is put aside enough money to buy a small ranch, but events--the poaching of protected animals, the murder of a Mexican citizen, an outbreak of local militia terrorism--conspire to take advantage of his highly developed detection and survival skills.<b>Michael Mcgarrity</b> entered the New Mexico Law Enforcement Academy in his forties, joining the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department.

It describes the growing unrest that I encounter around the world, the frustration and courage of those who dare to challenge the power of the political corporate world. Paul Hawken states eloquently all that I believe so passionately to be true - that there is inherent goodness at the heart of our humanity, that collectively we can - and are - changing the world. Please read and share <i>Blessed Unrest</i>, a celebration of the awakening of the human spirit. It will inspire and encourage millions more to take action. <br>-Jane Goodall, UN Ambassador for Peace </p><p>If you have lost a sense of direction in your life, if despair dogs your every step, pick up a pencil and pick up this book. Paul Hawken, without a trace of self-importance, impales a very dark room on the beam of a very bright light here. In his hands, the civil society movement reveals itself as the action that has replaced the talk. <br>-Barry Lopez, author of <i>Resistance and Arctic Dreams</i> </p><p>This is the first full account of the real news of our time, and it's exactly the opposite of the official account. The movers and shakers on our planet aren't the billionaires and the generals--they are the incredible numbers of people around the world filled with love for neighbor and for the earth who are resisting, remaking, restoring, renewing, revitalizing. This powerful and lovely book is their story--our story--and it's high time someone's told it. Nothing you read for years to come will fill you with more hope and more determination. <br>-Bill McKibben, author of <i>Deep Economy</i> and <i>The End of Nature</i> </p><p><i>Blessed Unrest</i> is a beautiful, soulful, crucial book. It is a manifesto of hope for the 21st century grounded squarely in the hearts of engaged people around the planet. Paul Hawken chronicles and testifies on behalf of this "movement with no name" with his charismatic intelligence and insight. This book makes the invisible visible. I believe Hawken when he says we are part of the Earth's immune system each time we exercise our active compassion in the name of social justice and ecological health. I love this book. It is a field guide for all that is possible. <br>-Terry Tempest Williams, author of <i>The Open Space of Democracy</i> </p><p>Many books describe the world in ways that break our hearts. <i>Blessed Unrest</i> invokes a heartbreak from which light pours. Paul Hawken is stupendously well informed. He is also critical without rancor, intuitive without woo woo, and poetic or hard-minded as the case requires. His narrative flows from a harrowing litany of "free market" abuses and desecrations to the countless life-saving actions and organizations that now envelope the earth in response. This is a work of enormous love and consequence. Every compassion-driven soul who reads it will be stunned by the scope and power of the movement we've inadvertently formed. When, inevitably, my daughters someday feels their hearts broken by the wounded world they have inherited, I will be handing them this book of books. <br>-David James Duncan, author of <i>The Brothers K</i> and <i>God Laughs &amp; Plays</i> </p><p>For the first time since life evolved, one species is now altering the physical, chemical, and biological features of the planet on a geological scale. Scientists tell us of a litany of ecological disasters--climate change, toxic pollution, species extinction, marine depletion, deforestation--the depressing list can paralyze one with hopelessness and despair. Fear can motivate immediate action in the short-run, but hope can be sustained. Paul Hawken's writings are always at the cutting edge of environmental thought, original, surprising and shot through with optimism. </p><p><i>Blessed Unrest</i> is an uplifting perspective, engendering wonder and hope. For all of us that are squirreling away in our individual small ways, it is inspiring to realize that millions of us can add up to an irresistible force. Read this book and shout "Hallelujah!" <br>-David Suzuki, author of <i>The Sacred Balance</i> </p><p>Paul Hawken is at the top of his storytelling art in <i>Blessed Unrest</i>. By revealing the twin heart of the environmental and social justice movements, he helps us know ourselves in a new way--as competent members of the natural world, intent on recovering from our stumble as a species. Each page yields surprise and "of course!" recognition for what has been swelling beneath our collective ground for over 100 years. I read it in a single sitting, hungry for the next piece of the puzzle, the next 6-degrees-of-separation coincidence. Hawken makes these invisible truths obvious through impeccably researched tales told in the bell-clear prose of a statesman poet. In this chronicle of the groundswell with no name, we have found our Tocqueville, our Twain, and our Sinclair. <br>-Janine Benyus, author of <i>Biomimicry</i> </p><p>On one side the four horsemen of the apocalypse; on the other a vast and nameless uprising of peoples and organizations fighting for justice, places, communities, diversity, and health--the planetary immune system. Paul Hawken's <i>Blessed Unrest</i> is not just a good book, it is a necessary book, wise, eloquent, perceptive, sober, and timely but above all, hopeful. A landmark! <br>-David Orr, author <i>Design on the Edge and The Last Refuge</i> </p><p>Paul Hawken has written an important and significant book--intelligent, compelling, moving, and hopeful. In the broad sweep of a history of diffuse and seemingly unconnected events and people, he has found emergent pattern. That pattern, amazing simultaneously in its intricacy and simplicity, gives clarity to the direction humankind is moving in its struggle for survival. Read and regain a sense of optimism for our grandchildren's grandchildren; and be motivated to ensure that they inherit a restored earth and an equitable society. <br>-Ray Anderson, CEO of Interface and author of <i>Mid-Course Correction</i></p><b>Paul Hawken</b> is an environmentalist, entrepreneur, journalist, and bestselling author of six previous books.

Maryjo Koch's informative, hand-lettered text is drawn from her own observations in the field, as well as literature, science, and mythology. It includes quotes from notable figures such as Edgar Allan Poe, Miguel de Cervantes, and Henry David Thoreau: "How can you expect the birds to sing when their groves are cut down?" Discover fascinating tidbits, such as how the tailorbird actually stitches its nest together using its beak as a needle, tying knots as it goes along. Though it's not an encyclopedic A-Z edition, you'll find information about the tiniest bee hummingbird, laying eggs in her thimble-sized nest, as well as the eight-foot-tall ostrich laying grapefruit-sized eggs weighing almost three and a half pounds.<p> More remarkable than the text, however, is the incredible variety of images included in one single book. The hand lettering takes the form of an egg or the flowing pattern of a bird in flight, or simply creates a design on its own. Koch's images include fairly straightforward naturalist paintings along with more imaginative ones, such as the charming illustration of a menu from the Blue Bird Inn, with selections including the common earthworm, poison oak berries, and hundred-legged centipedes. This is definitely a book well suited to bird lovers and art lovers of all ages.</p>With her enchanting watercolor images and hand-lettered prose, artist and author Maryjo Koch explores, with both authority and humor, everything in the world of birds.</p><h2>31 Days to Great Sex</h2><p>Do you yearn to feel truly intimate with your spouse?

Even more alien to those societies has been the tendency found in the West to articulate personal identity almost entirely in racial terms. For in racialized nations like the United States, Europe, South Africa or the Caribbean, appearance or physical attributes, such as hair, skin and bone structure, have been more consequential, more starkly invested with social signficance, than anything else such as family, wealth culture education or personal achievement. It goes without saying that this investing of bodily marks with so high a degree of significance is sociogenic in origin and not phylogenic. To think otherwise would be to place racism beyond the possibility of eradication. It is a historical accident, not a necessity of nature, that produces racist perceptions, actions and discourse. Some historians say that the concept of race did not enter European consciousness until the fifteen century. But certainly, by the midpoint of the nineteenth century Benjamin Disraeli could declare that all is race. That is, the basic human condition and thus economic, political, scientific and cultural positions are taken to be determined by race. So by the twentieth century, Cromer and Balfour, the most highly-esteemed of British colonial administrators, took it as a matter of course that Europeans and the English in particular, were the master race. All others were subject races.</p><p></p><h2>The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition (Volume 8)</h2><p>The ultimate authority on the usage and meaning of English words and phrases, unparalleled in its accuracy and comprehensiveness, the Oxford English Dictionary is the supreme reference work for anyone who loves the language.

In <i>Chinese Cinderella</i>, Adeline Yen Mah returns to her roots to tell the story of her painful childhood and her ultimate triumph and courage in the face of despair. Adeline's affluent, powerful family considers her bad luck after her mother dies giving birth to her. Life does not get any easier when her father remarries. She and her siblings are subjected to the disdain of her stepmother, while her stepbrother and stepsister are spoiled. Although Adeline wins prizes at school, they are not enough to compensate for what she really yearns for -- the love and understanding of her family.<br><br>Following the success of the critically acclaimed adult bestseller <i>Falling Leaves</i>, this memoir is a moving telling of the classic Cinderella story, with Adeline Yen Mah providing her own courageous voice.</p><p><i>Chinese Cinderella</i> is the perfect title for Adeline Yen Mah's compelling autobiography in which, like the fairy-tale maiden, her childhood was ruled by a cruel stepmother. "Fifth Younger Sister" or "Wu Mei," as Yen Mah was called, is only an infant when her father remarries after her mother's death. As the youngest of her five siblings, Wu Mei suffers the worst at the hands of her stepmother Niang. She is denied carfare, frequently forgotten at school at the end of the day, and whipped for daring to attend a classmate's birthday party against Niang's wishes. Her father even forgets the spelling of her name when filling out her school enrollment record. In her loneliness, Wu Mei turns to books for company: "I was alone with my beloved books. What bliss! To be left in peace with Cordelia, Regan, Gonoril, and Lear himself--characters more real than my family... What happiness! What comfort!" Even though Wu Mei is repeatedly moved up to grades above those of her peers, it is only when she wins an international play-writing contest in high school that her father finally takes notice and grants her wish to attend college in England. Despite her parent's heartbreaking neglect, she eventually becomes a doctor and realizes her dream of being a writer.<p> Teens, with their passionate convictions and strong sense of fair play, will be immediately enveloped in the gross injustice of Adeline Yen Mah's story. A complete glossary, historical notes on the state of Chinese society and politics during Yen Mah's childhood, and the legend of the original Chinese Cinderella round out this stirring testimony to the strength of human character and the power of education.

Dark Christmas trees, lowered thermostats, empty gas tanks, and the new fifty-five-mile-per-hour speed limit all suggested that America was a nation in decline. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be fuelish&#x201d; became the national motto. Though the embargo would end the following year, it introduced a new kind of insecurity into American life&#x2015;an insecurity that would only intensify when the Iranian Revolution led to new shortages at the end of the decade.</p><p>As Meg Jacobs shows, the oil crisis had a decisive impact on American politics. If Vietnam and Watergate taught us that our government lied, the energy crisis taught us that our government didn&#x2019;t work. Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter promoted ambitious energy policies that were meant to rally the nation and end its dependence on foreign oil, but their efforts came to naught. The Democratic Party was divided, with older New Deal liberals who prized access to affordable energy squaring off against young environmentalists who pushed for conservation. Meanwhile, conservative Republicans argued that there would be no shortages at all if the government got out of the way and let the market work. The result was a political stalemate and panic across the country: miles-long gas lines, Big Oil conspiracy theories, even violent strikes by truckers.</p><p>Jacobs concludes that the energy crisis of the 1970s became, for many Americans, an object lesson in the limitations of governmental power. Washington proved unable to design an effective national energy policy, and the result was a mounting skepticism about government intervention that set the stage for the rise of Reaganism. She offers lively portraits of key figures, from Nixon and Carter to the zealous energy czar William Simon and the young Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Jacobs&#x2019;s absorbing chronicle ends with the 1991 Gulf War, when President George H. W. Bush sent troops to protect the free flow of oil in the Persian Gulf. It was a failure of domestic policy at home that helped precipitate military action abroad. As we face the repercussions of a changing climate, a volatile oil market, and continued turmoil in the Middle East, <i>Panic at the Pump</i> is a necessary and lively account of a formative period in American political history.</p></p><p><b>Meg Jacobs</b> teaches history and public affairs at Princeton University.

Jacobs convincingly demonstrates its long-term consequences . . . [and] succeeds masterfully in explaining both the way the oil crises of the 1970s unfolded and how they helped to shape subsequent developments, domestic as well as foreign . . . <i>Panic at the Pump</i> is without question an important book that contributes mightily to our understanding of the modern American state, the U.S. political system, and contemporary U.S. foreign policy." <b>&#x2015;Mary Ann Heiss, <i>American Historical Review</i></b></p><p>"In 1973, 'oil shock' engulfed the United States as the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries embargoed exports.

Jacob's book will be eye opening for those who want to learn about what actually happened.

IN NEW, FINE CONDITION WITH FINE DUST JACKET.</p><p></p><h2>Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament</h2><p>We cannot know Jesus without knowing his story. Today the debate over who Jesus is rages on. Has the Bible bound Christians to a narrow and mistaken notion of Jesus? Should we listen to other gospels, other sayings of Jesus, that enlarge and correct a mistaken story? Is the real Jesus entangled in a web of the church&#39;s Scripture, awaiting liberation from our childhood faith so he might speak to our contemporary pluralistic world? To answer these questions we need to know what story Jesus claimed for himself. Christopher Wright is convinced that Jesus&#39; own story is rooted in the story of Israel. In this book he traces the life of Christ as it is illuminated by the Old Testament. And he describes God&#39;s design for Israel as it is fulfilled in the story of Jesus.</p><p>Christopher J. H.

There. I know him. He has been a young punk in Ukraine, the idol of the Soviet underground; a bum, then a multimillionaire's butler in Manhattan; a fashionable writer in Paris; a lost soldier in the Balkans; and now, in the fantastic shambles of postcommunism, the elderly but charismatic leader of a party of young desperadoes. He sees himself as a hero; you might call him a scumbag: I suspend my judgment on the matter. It's a dangerous life, an ambiguous life: a real adventure novel. It is also, I believe, a life that says something. Not just about him, Limonov, not just about Russia, but about all our history since the end of the Second World War."</p><p>So Eduard Limonov isn't fictional&#x2015;but he might as well be. This pseudobiography isn't a novel, but it reads like one: from Limonov's grim childhood to his desperate, comical, ultimately successful attempts to gain the respect of Russia's literary intellectual elite; to his immigration to New York, then to Paris; to his return to the motherland. <i>Limonov </i>could be read as a charming picaresque. But it could also be read as a troubling counternarrative of the second half of the twentieth century, one that reveals a violence, an anarchy, a brutality, that the stories we tell ourselves about progress tend to conceal.</p></p><p><p><b>Emmanuel Carr�re</b>, born in Paris in 1957, is a writer, scriptwriter, and film producer.

This new name pays tribute to Felix Dzerzhinsky, one of the earliest Bolsheviks and founder of the secret police agency that has throughout its history been known as the Cheka, GPU, NKVD, KGB, and is today called the FSB. In this book we will meet it in the form of the last three of these menacing acronyms, but Russians, in addition to the designations of each era, call it, even more ominously, <i>organy</i>: the organs. The war is raging; heavy industry has been dismantled and relocated to the hinterland, out of the theater of operations. In this way, a weapons factory in Dzerzhinsk ends up employing the city&#x2019;s entire population, as well as NKVD troops to watch over them. It&#x2019;s a time of heroism and brutality: a worker who arrives five minutes late is court-martialed, and it&#x2019;s the Chekists, as the secret police are called, who arrest, sentence, and execute him, if need be, with a bullet to the back of the head. One night, as some Messerschmitts on a reconnaissance flight from the Lower Volga drop some bombs on the city, a soldier standing guard over the factory uses his flashlight to light the way for a young worker, who left her post late and is hurrying to a shelter. She stumbles and catches hold of his arm. He notices a tattoo on her wrist. In the darkness lit up by the glow of fires their faces come closer. Their lips touch.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>The soldier, Venyamin Savenko, is twenty-three and comes from a family of Ukrainian peasants. A skilled electrician, he was recruited by the NKVD, which plucks the best workers from every industry. So, rather than being sent to the front like most of the youths his age, he was assigned to guard a weapons factory in the countryside. He&#x2019;s far from home, which is more the rule than the exception in the Soviet Union: what with deportations, exiles, mass population transfers, people continually being shuffled around, the chances of living and dying where you were born are as good as nil.</p> <p>Raya Zybin, for her part, comes from Gorky, formerly Nizhny Novgorod, where her father directed a restaurant. In the Soviet Union you don&#x2019;t own or manage a restaurant, you direct one. It&#x2019;s not something you can start up or buy into, but a post to which you&#x2019;re assigned, and not a bad one at that. Unfortunately Raya&#x2019;s father was dismissed for embezzlement and sent to a disciplinary battalion in the battle for Leningrad, where he died not long ago. It&#x2019;s a stain on the family, and in these days, in this country, a stain on the family can ruin your life. For us it&#x2019;s one of the most basic tenets of justice that children don&#x2019;t pay for the crimes of their fathers, but in the Soviet Union it&#x2019;s not even a formal principle, something you can appeal to in theory. The children of Trotskyists, or of kulaks, as wealthy farmers are called, or of those privileged under the old regime, are doomed to live as outcasts, barred from becoming Young Pioneers, attending university, and joining the Red Army or the Party; they have one chance to escape this fate, and that&#x2019;s by renouncing their parents and being as enthusiastic about the Party as possible. And since being enthusiastic means denouncing those around you, the organs have no better helpers than those with tarnished biographies&#x2014;as is brought home by so many terrible stories in Orlando Figes&#x2019;s outstanding book <i>The Whisperers</i>, on private life under Stalin. In the case of Raya&#x2019;s father it may be that his death on the battlefield helped things somewhat; the fact is that like the Savenkos, the Zybins made it through the Great Terror of the thirties without mishap. No doubt they were simply too insignificant. This luck doesn&#x2019;t stop young Raya from being ashamed of her dishonest father, just as she&#x2019;s ashamed of the tattoo she got while she was at technical school. Later, she&#x2019;ll try to get rid of it by spraying hydrochloric acid on her wrist, because she hates not being able to wear short-sleeved dresses and, as the wife of an officer, she hates looking like a bit of a slut.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Raya&#x2019;s pregnancy coincides almost to the day with the siege of Stalingrad. Conceived in May 1942, a terrible month, the time of the most bitter defeats, Eduard is born on February 2, 1943, twenty days before the German Sixth Army capitulates and the tables turn. Repeatedly he will be told that he is a child of victory, and that he would have been born into a world of slaves if the men and women of Russia hadn&#x2019;t sacrificed their lives to prevent the city that bore Stalin&#x2019;s name from falling to the enemy. Later bad things will be said about Stalin; he&#x2019;ll be called a tyrant and his reign of terror will be denounced. But for the people of Eduard&#x2019;s generation he will remain the supreme leader of the people of the Union at the most tragic moment in their history; the man who defeated the Nazis and proved himself capable of a sacrifice worthy of the ancient Romans: the Germans had captured his son, Lieutenant Yakov Dzhugashvili, while the Russians had captured Field Marshal Paulus, one of the top military leaders of the Reich, at Stalingrad. When the German High Command proposed an exchange, Stalin responded with disdain that he didn&#x2019;t exchange field marshals for simple lieutenants. Yakov committed suicide by throwing himself on the electrified barbed wire fence of his prison camp.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Two anecdotes stand out from Eduard&#x2019;s earliest childhood. The first one, his father&#x2019;s favorite, is touching: the baby, for lack of a crib, lies in a shell crate, sucking on a herring&#x2019;s tail in place of a pacifier, smiling as if he were in seventh heaven. &#x201c;<i>Molodets</i>!&#x201d; Venyamin cries: &#x201c;Good boy! This little guy will be comfortable wherever he goes!&#x201d;</p> <p>The second anecdote, less charming, is told by Raya. She&#x2019;s downtown, carrying her baby on her back, when the Luftwaffe launches an air raid. She takes refuge in a cellar with a dozen city dwellers, some of them terrified, others apathetic. The ground and walls shake; everyone listens to gauge how far away the bombs are falling and what buildings they&#x2019;re bringing down. Little Eduard starts to cry, attracting the attention, then the rage of one guy who hisses that Fritz has ultramodern techniques for pinpointing live targets, that they home in on the faintest sounds and that the baby&#x2019;s crying will get them all killed. He does such a good job of rousing the others against Raya that they throw her out, forcing her to seek another shelter under the falling bombs. Livid with anger, she tells herself and her baby that everything people say about helping one another, about solidarity and fraternity, is just a joke. &#x201c;The truth, and never forget this, Edichka, is that men are cowards and bastards, and they&#x2019;ll kill you if you&#x2019;re not ready to strike first.&#x201d;</p> <p>2</p> <p>IN THE PERIOD following the war, cities aren&#x2019;t called cities but &#x201c;population concentrations,&#x201d; and the young Savenko family, moving from place to place as the postings come, lives in barracks and army camps in various population concentrations on the Volga before settling in February 1947 in Kharkov, now Kharkiv, in Ukraine. Kharkov, a large industrial center and rail hub, was the scene of bitter fighting between the Germans and Russians, who took and lost and retook it, each occupying the city in turn, massacring the inhabitants in the process and leaving, by the end of the war, nothing more than a field of ruins. The concrete constructivist building on Red Army Street that lodges the NKVD officers and their families&#x2014;called &#x201c;persons in charge&#x201d;&#x2014;overlooks what was once the imposing main station and is now a chaos of stones, bricks, and metal surrounded by fences that you&#x2019;re not allowed to climb over because apart from the bodies of German soldiers, there are mines and grenades strewn amid the rubble. One little boy had his hand blown off. Despite this example, the band of rascals Eduard joins likes nothing more than raiding these ruins, hunting for cartridges whose powder they empty onto the tramway tracks, causing crackling and fireworks, once even provoking a derailment that becomes legendary. In the evening, the biggest boys tell terrifying stories: of dead Fritzes who haunt the ruins on the lookout for unsuspecting stragglers; of stew pots in the cafeteria with children&#x2019;s fingers at the bottom; of cannibals and trading in human flesh. Everyone is hungry in these days, there&#x2019;s nothing to eat but bread, potatoes, and above all kasha, the buckwheat porridge that&#x2019;s part of every meal served up by poor Russians and which features occasionally in the homes of fairly well-off Parisians like me, who pride ourselves on how well we make it. Sausage is a rare luxury; Eduard is so wild about it he dreams of becoming a butcher when he grows up. No dogs, no cats, no pets: they&#x2019;d get eaten. Rats, on the other hand, abound. Twenty million Russians died in the war, but another twenty million brave the postwar period without a roof over their heads. Most children no longer have fathers; most of the men still alive are invalids. On every street corner you see people missing an arm, a leg, two legs. Everywhere you see gangs of children left to fend for themselves, children whose parents died in the war or are imprisoned as public enemies, hungry children, child thieves and child murderers, children returned to the state of nature who move about in dangerous hordes and for whom the age of criminal responsibility, that is, of the death penalty, has been lowered to twelve.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>The little boy admires his father. On Saturday evenings he likes to watch him grease his service weapon, he likes to see him put on his uniform, and nothing makes him happier than being allowed to polish his father&#x2019;s boots. He plunges one arm inside, right up to the shoulder, and spreads the polish with his other hand with care, using special brushes and cloths for each step of the operation, part of a whole kit that takes up half of Venyamin&#x2019;s suitcase when he leaves on assignment and that his son looks after, packing and unpacking it, anxious for the glorious day when he&#x2019;ll have one too. In his eyes, the only men worthy of the name are soldiers, and the only children to hang around with are the children of soldiers. He doesn&#x2019;t know any others: the families of the officers and junior officers living in the NKVD building on Red Army Street keep to themselves and have little respect for the civvies, a sniveling and undisciplined lot who are liable to stop without warning in the middle of the sidewalk, obliging the soldier to readjust his path in order to keep to the steady, energetic, regulation four-mile-an-hour pace at which Eduard will walk until the end of his days.</p> <p>To get them to go to sleep at night, the children on Red Army Street are told stories of the conflict that the Russians don&#x2019;t call the Second World War as we do but the Great Patriotic War, and their dreams are filled with caving trenches, dead horses, and brothers in arms whose heads are ripped off by an exploding shell. Eduard is thrilled by these stories. Still, he notices his father seems a bit embarrassed when his mother tells them. They&#x2019;re never about him or his adventures, but only about Eduard&#x2019;s uncle, Raya&#x2019;s brother, and the little boy doesn&#x2019;t dare ask, &#x201c;But what about you, Dad, did you go to war too? Did you fight?&#x201d;</p> <p>No, he didn&#x2019;t fight. Most of the men his age have looked death in the eye. War, his son will write later, bit them between its teeth like a suspect coin and they know, for not having bent, that they are the real thing. Not his father. He didn&#x2019;t look death in the eye. He served out the war far from the front, and his wife rarely misses a chance to remind him of it.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>She&#x2019;s hard, proud of her standing as the wife of an officer, an enemy to all tenderness. She always sides against her son and with his adversaries. If he&#x2019;s been beaten up she doesn&#x2019;t console him but lauds the aggressor: that&#x2019;ll make Eduard a man, not a sissy. One of his first memories is suffering from a serious ear infection when he was five. Pus dripped from his ear; he was deaf for several weeks. The way to the clinic where his mother took him crossed the railway tracks. He saw, rather than heard, the train as it approached&#x2014;the smoke, the speed, the shape of the black metal monster&#x2014;and he was suddenly seized by the irrational fear that she wanted to hurl him under its wheels. He started to scream: &#x201c;Mommy! Mommy! Don&#x2019;t throw me under the train! Please! Don&#x2019;t throw me under the train!&#x201d; In his account he insists on the importance of the word <i>please</i>, as if this politeness alone had dissuaded his mother from her dire project.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>When I got to know him in Paris thirty years later, Eduard liked to say his father was a Chekist, because he knew that would cast a pall over the room. Once, after he&#x2019;d gotten his kicks with this announcement, he poked fun at us: &#x201c;Stop imagining such terrible things, my dad was basically a gendarme, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;</p> <p>Really, that&#x2019;s all?</p> <p>During the civil war, just after the Revolution, Trotsky, serving as commander of the Red Army, had been obliged to press members of the imperial armed forces into service. These were professional soldiers and weapons specialists, but &#x201c;bourgeois specialists,&#x201d; and as such relatively untrustworthy. He created a corps of political commissars to control them, countersign their orders, and shoot them if they showed signs of resisting. That&#x2019;s how the principle of the &#x201c;double administration&#x201d; was born, based on the idea that to accomplish a task you need at least two men: one to do it and one to make sure he does it in conformity with Marxism-Leninism. This principle spread from the army to society at large, and in the process, it became clear that a third person was then needed to supervise the second, a fourth to supervise the third, and so on.</p> <p>Venyamin Savenko is a modest cog in this paranoid system. His work is to supervise, control, and report. That does not necessarily imply&#x2014;on this point Eduard is right&#x2014;terrible acts of repression. Let&#x2019;s not forget, as a simple NKVD orderly he spent the war planted in front of a factory. Promoted during peacetime to the modest rank of junior lieutenant, he works as a <i>nacht-kluba</i>, which you could translate as &#x201c;nightclub manager,&#x201d; but which here means organizing leisure and cultural activities for the soldiers&#x2014;dance parties on Red Army Day, for example. The job suits him well: he plays the guitar, likes to sing, and in his own way has a taste for the good things in life. He even puts clear polish on his nails: quite the dandy, this Junior Lieutenant Savenko, who, his son says in retrospect, could have led a far more interesting life if he&#x2019;d had the courage to get out from under his wife&#x2019;s thumb.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>The life of nightclubbing NKVD-style in which Venyamin to a certain extent blossoms doesn&#x2019;t last, however, because the job is swiped by one Captain Levitin, who becomes without knowing it the sworn enemy of the Savenkos and a key figure in Eduard&#x2019;s private mythology: the schemer who&#x2019;s not as good as you but is more successful, whose insolence and devilish luck not only humiliate you in front of the bosses but, even worse, in front of your family, so that the little boy, who all the while loyally parrots his parents&#x2019; disdain for Levitin, can&#x2019;t stop thinking in secret&#x2014;although he hates himself for it&#x2014;that his father is kind of pathetic and that Levitin&#x2019;s son is, actually, pretty lucky.

Art also created an autobiographical graphic novel called <i>The Big Amoeba</i> for Platinum Studios. He lives outside of Chicago with his wife, Rose, and their children Sonny, Gordon, and Audrey.<br><br>Bronx-born writer and artist <b>Franco Aureliani</b> has been drawing comics since he could hold a crayon. Currently residing in upstate New York with his wife,&nbsp;Ivette, and son, Nicolas, he spends most of his days in his Batcave-like studio where he produces DC's <i>Tiny Titans</i> comics. In 1995, Franco founded Blindwolf Studios, an independent art studio where he and fellow creators can create children's comics. Franco is the creator, artist and writer of <i>Weirdsville, L'il &nbsp;Creeps</i>, and <i>Eagle All Star</i>, as well as the co-creator and writer of <i>Patrick the Wolf &nbsp;Boy</i>. When he's not writing or drawing, Franco also teaches high school art.Mainstays of comic books since the 1960s, and stars of two generations of cartoons, the Teen Titans are morphed into Tot Titans for a series aimed at younger audiences. Adventures that include &#x201c;welcoming&#x201d; a new principal, getting a new dog, babysitting younger siblings, and fighting for one&#x2019;s spot in the playground are told in gag vignettes, most lasting 2-3 pages. The art is pleasantly funky, filled with motion and lively color, but the book as a whole proves a difficult example of audience selection. An in-depth knowledge of current Teen Titans continuity is necessary to distinguish between the massive cast of characters and to understand the relationships between them that many of the punch lines rely on; and references to such obscure touchstones as the movie Fight Club would make this a somewhat bizarre choice for most young readers. For large collections, this would be a good offering for young fans of the Teen Titans cartoon or those readers who are super-hero crazy, but too young for DC&#x2019;s Adventures titles.

The teachings given here on the outlook and technique of meditation provide the foundation that every practitioner needs to awaken as the Buddha did. Trungpa teaches us to let go of the urge to make meditation serve our ambition; thus we can relax into openness. We are shown how the deliberate practice of mindfulness develops into contrived awareness, and we discover the world of insight that awareness reveals. We learn of a subtle psychological stage set that we carry with us everywhere and unwittingly use to structure all our experience&#x2014;and we find that meditation gradually carries us beyond this and beyond ego altogether to the experience of unconditioned freedom.</p><p>Ch�gyam Trungpa (1940&#x2013;1987)&#x2014;meditation master, teacher, and artist&#x2014;founded Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, the first Buddhist-inspired university in North America; the Shambhala Training program; and an international association of meditation centers known as Shambhala International.

Theophanes and Nonna, their names are said to have been. Their home was Patara, a flourishing town at the mouth of the river Xanthos on the Mediterranean coast, a place where the forested hills sloped down to the clear blue sea. </p><p> Theophanes and Nonna were a well-to-do couple. Perhaps they inherited land and money. Theophanes may have run a prosperous trade in cloth or milled grains. History does not tell us. We know only that, according to one old chronicle, they were people "of substantial lineage, holding property enough without superfluity." </p><p> Their comfortable lives were troubled by one great unhappiness: though they had been married for many years, they had never managed to have children. As time passed, they wept and waited, but no child came. Still, Nonna refused to give up hope. Instead, she did something very wise. She prayed. Like Hannah in the First Book of Samuel in the Bible, she poured out her soul to God, asking him to remember her. </p><p> It must have seemed like a miracle when late in life, after so many hopes and tears, Nonna's prayer was answered around the year A.D. 280 with the birth of a son. She surely recalled how Hannah, who was finally blessed with the boy Samuel, had vowed to "give him unto the Lord all the days of his life" (1 Samuel 1:11 KJV). </p><p> Some say that when Nonna's child was placed in his bath right after birth, he stood up by himself and raised his arms as if in praise of God. Others say that on Wednesdays and Fridays, traditional days of fasting for early Christians, he refused to nurse until after sundown. Such are the legends. But there must have been something that made the proud parents hope that their child would someday serve God and his fellow men in some remarkable way. They christened the baby Nicholas, a name that in Greek means "people's victor," after an uncle who was an abbot at a nearby monastery. </p><p> Patara was a good town to grow up in, a bustling center of trade full of sights for a boy to explore. Wide avenues lined with columns and paved with stones led from town gates past houses, shops, and temples to busy agorai (market squares). Beneath brightly colored awnings, merchants arranged their goods: grapes, olives, cheese, herbs, dyed wool and cotton, pottery, jewelry, leather, glassware, skins of wine. The shoppers who haggled with vendors and the men who swapped news in the shade of roofed colonnades all spoke Greek, the dominant language of that part of the world. Young Nicholas must have spent many hours listening to the shouts of the tradesmen advertising their wares and the talk of women filling jugs with water at the public fountains. </p><p> As he roamed the streets of Patara, the boy saw reminders of both his proud Greek heritage and imperial Rome's wide reach. A temple to Apollo drew travelers hoping to divine the future from a revered oracle. The grand assembly building, where officials from all over Lycia met to debate, could seat one thousand people. Elegant baths with rooms covered by marble tiles dotted the city. A massive monument with three Roman arches, built to honor a governor of Lycia, supported an aqueduct that brought water to Patara's inhabitants. </p><p> On a hillside near the sea stood the favorite spot of many Patarans, the amphitheater. More than two dozen tiers of stone seats rose above a raised stage where actors spoke or sang their lines. The crowds that gathered to enjoy comedies, tragedies, and dances could be a rowdy bunch, stomping their feet when pleased or throwing olive pits when disappointed by the show. </p><p> But Nicholas's favorite spot may well have been the port, where the boy could watch fishing boats unload the day's catch and merchants' ships arrive from points around the eastern Mediterranean: Rhodes, Cyprus, Antioch, Alexandria, and beyond. Occasionally seaman who had made it as far as Rome itself sailed into Patara. They brought news of Roman armies on the march, edicts of emperors, and tales of distant places like North Africa and Gaul. <br> </p> <b>� � �</b> <br> <p> AT ABOUT AGE SEVEN, Nicholas was placed under the charge of a pedagogue, a trusted slave who took him to school, helped him with lessons, and kept him out of mischief. The boy gathered with other students under a roofed colonnade to study grammar and arithmetic. He practiced writing with a stylus on a wooden tablet covered with beeswax, and listened intently as the schoolmaster told ancient stories such as how Achilles killed Hector outside the walls of Troy. </p><p> But there was one part of the boy's education not to be trusted to a pedagogue or schoolmaster, and that was the matter of faith. Theophanes and Nonna had embraced a new and growing religion, one that required utmost devotion. They were members of Patara's Christian community. </p><p> In the two and a half centuries since the time of Jesus, Christianity had spread from the remote province of Judea on the eastern Mediterranean to much of the Roman Empire. The story of the carpenter from Galilee had won converts from Palestine to Britain. His message of love brought new hope to believers. Christianity welcomed all races and classes into a community that offered refuge in a tempest-tossed world. </p><p> On Sundays, Nicholas and his parents attended services in a neighbor's house, where they prayed, sang hymns, and studied scripture. They loved the Book of Psalms for its soul-stirring verses, such as, "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands. Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing" (Psalm 100:1-2 KJV). They carefully memorized the words of Jesus: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40 KJV). They shared bread and wine in remembrance of the Last Supper so they would be one with Christ. At the end of prayers they said Amen (so be it), and they sounded praise with the word Alleluia (God be praised). </p><p> Nicholas loved hearing stories about the boy David slaying the giant Goliath, Daniel standing unharmed in the pit of hungry lions, and the friends of the paralyzed man lowering him through the roof of a crowded house so Jesus might heal him. He learned that the Apostle Paul, traveling on the road to Damascus, was struck down by a blinding light and heard a voice saying, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?" The tireless missionary had visited Patara on one of his famous journeys and left behind a small group of converts. Christians copied the letters that Paul wrote to congregations in places such as Corinth, Galatia, and Philippi, and passed them from church to church, pouring over words such as, "[Love] bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things" (1 Corinthians 13:7 NASB). </p><p> Nicholas's parents taught him early on that Christians served God by serving the less fortunate. In an age when the general rule of existence was "Fend for yourself or die," a Christian's duty was to help others. Churches organized to care for the poor and sick. "See how those Christians love one another!" pagans marveled. </p><p> At times it was dangerous to be a Christian. The Roman Empire, though vast and mighty, faced desperate problems: a series of weak emperors, outbreaks of plague, generals who fought each other for power, attacks by barbarians along the empire's borders. When officials needed scapegoats to take the brunt of public frustrations, it was all too easy to single out Christians who refused to worship the old gods of Rome and sacrifice to the emperor. </p><p> The boy Nicholas heard stories of how the emperor Nero had blamed Christians for a disastrous fire that swept Rome in A.D. 64, and how he had made human torches of Christians to light his garden at night. He heard about Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna in Asia Minor, who was seized by the proconsul Statius Quadratus and ordered to curse Christ. </p><p> "I have wild beasts," the proconsul threatened. "If you do not repent, I will have you thrown to them." </p><p> "Send for them," Polycarp replied. </p><p> "If you do not despise the wild beasts, I will order you to be burned alive." </p><p> "Why do you delay? Bring on what you will." </p><p> They burned him alive while the crowd shouted, "This is the father of the Christians! This is the destroyer of our gods!" </p><p> In times of persecution, Christians might live one edict away from imprisonment or death. In years when rulers let them alone, they remained a close-knit community, protective of each other and wary of rumors of official displeasure. </p><p> But if being a Christian brought occasional scorn or danger, it also brought immeasurable rewards. As Nicholas grew, his faith grew. The old writers tell us that he began to spend less time following boyish pursuits, and more time pondering the message that Jesus had brought to the world. As he approached manhood, he discovered that the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, and peace. <br> <b></b></p><b> � � � </b> <br> <p> THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT surely must have tested his faith: a plague swept through Lycia, passing from town to town, cutting down whole families, striking rich and poor alike. Theophanes and Nonna were among the dead. </p><p> Nicholas, left alone in the world, went to live with his uncle at the monastery to recover from the blow. Slowly, bewilderment and despair gave way to acceptance. He asked God for strength and discovered that it came to him. As he healed, he resolved to train for the priesthood.

The only way they can stay together is to make it on their own. One night, during a storm, the children find an old red boxcar that keeps them warm and safe. They decide to make it their home.</p><p>Gertrude Chandler Warner was born in 1890 in Putnam, Connecticut, where she taught school and wrote The Boxcar Children because she had often imagined how delightful it would be to live in a caboose or freight car. Encouraged by the book&#39;s success, she went on to write eighteen more stories about the Alden children.Warner&#x2019;s Boxcar Children was published in 1942 to mixed reviews. Parents were alarmed that the novel&#x2019;s child heroes, the Alden siblings, got on so well without adult intervention. Children, however, felt empowered and enthusiastically applauded the young survivalists and their numerous further adventures. Denton, whose credits include work for the Cartoon Network, and Dubisch, best known for his fantasy comic artwork, have put together graphic-novel versions of some of the stories. In this first book, the orphaned Aldens set up housekeeping in an old boxcar, making the most of their particular strengths, until their grandfather takes them in. The story, though easy to read and follow, is presented in a surprisingly lackluster manner. The artwork, however, is more energetic, and the format works in the series&#x2019; favor, lending a contemporary feel even though the cars and clothes are vintage. The question remains, though, whether these modest pluses are enough to entice readers to continue to read the whole series (or find the original books).

Daniel wants his family safely out of New York City as soon as possible. In shock and grieving, but knowing she needs to protect their infant son Liam, Molly agrees to take him on the long journey to Paris to stay with her friends Sid and Gus, who are studying art in the City of Light.</p><p>But upon arriving in Paris, nothing goes as planned. Sid and Gus seem to have vanished into thin air, and Molly's search to figure out what happened to them will lead her through all levels of Parisian society, from extravagant salons to the dingy cafes where starving artists linger over coffee and loud philosophical debates. And when in the course of her search she stumbles across a dead body, Molly, on her own in a foreign country, starts to wonder if she and Liam might be in even more danger in Paris than they had been at home.</p><p>As Impressionism gives way to Fauvism and Cubism, and the Dreyfus affair rocks France, Molly races through Paris to outsmart a killer in <i>City of Darkness and Light</i>, Rhys Bowen's most spectacular Molly Murphy novel yet.</p></p><p>RHYS BOWEN is the author of the Anthony and Agatha Award&#x2013;winning Molly Murphy mysteries, the Edgar Award-nominated Evan Evans series, the Royal Spyness series, and <i>In Farleigh Field</i>. Born in England, she lives in San Rafael, California.One <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>New York City, May 1905 <br>Like many Irish people I have always been a strong believer in a sixth sense. In fact I had prided myself on mine. I credited it with alerting me to danger more than once during my career as an investigator. So I can&#x2019;t explain why it let me down on such a critical occasion, when an advance warning might have spared us all such grief. Maybe the perpetrator of this evil had not planned it in advance. Maybe it had been a last-minute order from above, so I had not been able to sense his intention or his presence&nbsp;&#x2026; or their presence. I&#x2019;m sure there must have been more than one of them. That was how they worked. <br>Anyway, there were certainly no uneasy thoughts in my head that bright May morning as I fed my little one his breakfast. He was eight months old now, a strapping boy with a shock of dark curls like his father and an impish smile. Now I think back on it I wonder if Aggie hadn&#x2019;t been the one with the sixth sense, although she had no Celtic connections that I knew of. She came into the kitchen while I was feeding Liam, bearing two letters in her hand. <br>&#x201c;Mail just arrived, Mrs. Sullivan,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Two letters for you. One with a foreign stamp.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That will be from my friends in Paris, I expect,&#x201d; I said, taking them from her. &#x201c;How nice.&#x201d; <br>I took in Sid&#x2019;s bold black script on the foreign envelope and noted that the other was my mother-in-law&#x2019;s weekly missive. The former would wait until I had the proper time to savor Sid&#x2019;s latest account of their adventures in Paris. The latter could simply wait. <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you going to read them?&#x201d; Aggie hovered at my shoulder, still fascinated by the foreign look of the envelope. <br>&#x201c;Later, when I have time.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If anyone ever wrote to me, I&#x2019;d want to read it right away,&#x201d; she said wistfully. Then she shivered and wrapped her arms around her scrawny body. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s awful cold in here today, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Cold for May.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Is it? I hadn&#x2019;t noticed.&#x201d; I looked out of the window where early roses were climbing up a trellis. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a nice bright day. You can come with me when I take Liam for his walk and you&#x2019;ll feel warmer in the sun.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I need to be getting on with the laundry,&#x201d; she said, eyeing Liam, who now had a generous amount of cream of wheat over his front. &#x201c;That child gets through more clothes than a little prince and I expect I&#x2019;ll warm myself up scrubbing away at the washboard.&#x201d; <br>She stood there, still hugging her arms to her skinny body. Although she had been with me since Liam was born, and had an appetite like a horse, there wasn&#x2019;t an ounce of flesh on her and she still looked like a pathetic little waif. I had taken her in out of pity, after she had been forced to give up the child she had had out of wedlock, but she had surprised me by being a hard worker and wonderful with the baby. She&#x2019;d been the oldest of ten and had grown up taking care of the younger ones&#x2014;a valuable asset to her family, but that hadn&#x2019;t stopped her parents from throwing her out the moment they learned she was pregnant. She was pathetically grateful to come to us and I in turn was grateful for her knowledge in those first difficult weeks with the new baby. <br>&#x201c;The laundry will wait,&#x201d; I said, smiling at her. &#x201c;Come on, get Liam changed out of those messy clothes and we&#x2019;ll go out.&#x201d; <br>She shook her head. &#x201c;No, Mrs. Sullivan. I think I&#x2019;d better stay and get those diapers out on the line, if you don&#x2019;t mind. A morning like this is too bright to last. There will be rain by the end of the day, you mark my words.&#x201d; <br>She had grown up on a farm in the Adirondacks so I believed her. &#x201c;All the more reason for me to give Liam his daily dose of fresh air,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a gloomy spring so far, hasn&#x2019;t it? I was beginning to think summer would never come.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been gloomy enough around here,&#x201d; Aggie said, &#x201c;with Captain Sullivan going around with a face that would curdle milk and hardly a civil word in his head.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not for you to criticize your employer,&#x201d; I said sharply and watched her flinch as if I&#x2019;d slapped her. Then I relented, of course. &#x201c;Captain Sullivan is under a great deal of worry at the moment. A policeman&#x2019;s job is never the easiest and right now I think he&#x2019;s battling a major problem. Not that he ever confides in me, but if his current bad temper is anything to go on, then I&#x2019;d say he had a particularly difficult case on his hands. It&#x2019;s our job to make sure his life is as pleasant as possible when he comes home.&#x201d; <br>She nodded silently as she lifted Liam out of his high chair and bore him away up the stairs. I cleaned away the aftermath of Liam&#x2019;s breakfast and considered my little speech. I realized it had been a pep talk for me as well as Aggie, because I had found Daniel&#x2019;s current black mood hard to take. More than once I&#x2019;d wondered why I ever thought that it had been a good idea to leave my life of freedom and independence as a private investigator to get married. I think I&#x2019;d expected to be able to share in his work, mulling over complicated cases with him and giving him the benefit of my own experience as a detective. But that hadn&#x2019;t happened. Daniel remained tight-lipped about his work. He was gone from morning till night most days and only popped in for a hasty meal. A quick peck on the cheek as he ran out of the door again was the best I could hope for. <i>For better or worse</i> rang through my head. That was what I&#x2019;d promised at the altar. I sighed and put the dishes in the sink for Aggie. Then I went up to my room to change my clothes. A walk in the sunshine would soon do wonders for my current mood. <br>Aggie was waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs with Liam already strapped in his buggy. &#x201c;You could take those letters with you to read,&#x201d; she said, handing them to me. <br>I laughed. &#x201c;I believe you&#x2019;re more interested in my mail than I am.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I love hearing about foreign parts,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like a fairy tale.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll read Miss Goldfarb&#x2019;s letter to you later if you like,&#x201d; I said. Aggie hadn&#x2019;t yet managed to learn to read, in spite of my efforts to teach her. I put on my hat, adjusting it in front of the hall mirror, then Aggie helped me maneuver the buggy down the front steps. <br>&#x201c;I hope you have a nice walk, Mrs. Sullivan,&#x201d; she called after me as I set off. <br>I almost asked her again to come with us, but I reminded myself that she was the servant and the laundry was her job. I&#x2019;d bring her a cake for tea, I decided. She loved the cakes I brought from the French bakery around the corner. As Liam and I bumped over the cobbles of Patchin Place I couldn&#x2019;t help glancing across at the doorway of number 9. It had been two months now since my friends Elena Goldfarb and Augusta Walcott, more familiarly known as Sid and Gus, had taken it into their heads to go to Paris, so that Gus could study art with the best painters of the day. I had never thought that Gus&#x2019;s talent for painting was as great as she believed it to be, but her cousin Willie Walcott had gone to study in Paris and was now apparently making a name for himself as a painter of the Impressionist school. He had promised introductions for Sid and Gus. <br>From their letters they seemed to be having a roaring good time, while I missed them terribly. I had come to count on their comforting presence across the street, their extravagant parties, and their bohemian lifestyle that Daniel only just tolerated for my sake. With Sid and Gus, life was never boring. You never knew when you&#x2019;d open their front door and find the front parlor turned into a Mongolian yurt or a Turkish harem. They never had to worry about the day-to-day trivialities of normal life. They had enough money to live as they wanted, according to their rules. This is not to say that they were always frivolous. They were keen supporters of the suffrage movement and I missed attending those meetings at their house as well. <br>I sighed as I came out onto Greenwich Avenue and steered Liam&#x2019;s buggy around a pile of steaming horse droppings. Ah, well. They&#x2019;d grow tired of Paris and come home eventually, wouldn&#x2019;t they? And in the meantime I had a husband to look after and a son to raise. Things could be worse. Liam leaned forward in the buggy, urging me to go faster, and babbled in delight when an automobile drove past us, its driver&#x2019;s long scarf streaming out in the breeze behind him as he steered the contraption around a slow moving dray. <i>Just like his father,</i> I thought, smiling at his excitement. We were seeing more and more automobiles these days. I know Daniel secretly hankered after one. He was allowed to drive the police vehicle when there was a special need, but that didn&#x2019;t include giving his family a ride. <br>I waited for a gap in the traffic before I pushed the buggy across into Washington Square, passing beneath the great arch and into the relative tranquility of the gardens beyond. Here activity was confined to mothers pushing buggies while toddlers clung to their skirts, bigger boys bowling iron hoops that rattled over the gravel paths, and even bigger boys playing a game of kick the can. I wondered why the latter weren&#x2019;t in school as it certainly wasn&#x2019;t a holiday. I suppose they could have been newsboys, taking a break from long hours standing on street corners. <br>I found a bench in the sun and turned the buggy so that Liam could watch the bigger children at play. He seemed more fascinated with the fountain in the center of the square and a flock of small birds that perched on the lip, daring each other to take a bath in the spray that flew out in the breeze. <br>With my son content for the moment I opened my letters. I dutifully read Daniel&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s letter first, as he&#x2019;d no doubt want a report on her doings and she&#x2019;d no doubt want a reply from me. Usually her weekly letters were a recital of what she had done around the house, what her young charge Bridie was doing, interspersed with slivers of local gossip. But today I was surprised to read, <i>By the time you read this I shall be gone.</i> <br>My heart lurched in my chest. I have to confess that I wasn&#x2019;t overly fond of Daniel&#x2019;s mother, but this was so sudden. Then I read on. <br> <i>I am writing this in haste to let you know that I am about to embark on a journey. I decided not to mention this plan to you in advance as I rather think that Daniel might have tried to dissuade me. And I don&#x2019;t think it would have taken that much to dissuade me since it was such a huge undertaking for me.</i> <br> <i>You remember my friend Letitia Blackstone? Her daughter Imogen married a young engineer who is now designing a bridge across the Mississippi River. Letitia wanted to visit her daughter who has just had a baby, but was reluctant to travel alone to such wild and barbaric parts. So she asked me if I would accompany her if she paid my way. Of course I agreed. What an adventure at my time of life to see a little more of our beautiful country before I die. And Letitia insists on doing everything first class so I don&#x2019;t expect it will be too uncomfortable or dangerous. It will also be a perfect opportunity for young Bridie. I&#x2019;m taking her along as my companion as she&#x2019;s been worried recently about her papa and this will take her mind off things.</i> <br>I stopped reading and stared out across the square. Poor little Bridie, whose father and brother had gone down to Panama to work on the building of the canal. None of the news that came from that hellhole had been good. Men had been dropping like flies, so it was said, from yellow fever and terrible working conditions. And there had been no news from Bridie&#x2019;s father for months so we had to assume the worst. <br>I read on. Martha the maid was to visit her ailing mother. The house was to be shut up and Mrs. Sullivan didn&#x2019;t know how long they would be away. She sent her warmest regards and a fond kiss to her grandchild. I folded the letter and put it back in its envelope. Well, that would be a surprise for Daniel. His mother was not the kind one would expect to make rash, last-minute decisions to go out into the wild west. <br>I glanced across at Liam and saw that he had fallen asleep. I adjusted his pillows, covered him properly and then turned to my other letter. It was as I expected, full of exciting tidbits of news of life in Paris. Sid wrote: <br> <i>Willie has obtained an introduction for Gus to none other than Reynold Bryce. You know who he is, don&#x2019;t you, Molly? He made a name for himself as part of the Boston School back in the eighties&#x2014;particularly with his paintings of the young girl he called Angela. Then at the height of his fame he took off for Paris and has remained here, becoming one of the leading lights among Impressionist painters. Anyway, he is THE patron and lodestone for American artists in Paris. His salon is where one needs to be seen. He holds an exhibition every spring and if he includes your work, you are IN! Gus is hoping he&#x2019;ll include her, naturally. She&#x2019;s been painting some really interesting canvasses recently, although I think she may be a little avant-garde for traditionalists like Reynold Bryce. Gus says she&#x2019;s not sure whether she&#x2019;s a Fauvist, a Cubist, or simply a modernist, but she&#x2019;s thrilled to be among artists who dare to paint with her boldness. We met a rather dashing young Spaniard in a bar. His name is Pablo Picasso and he said that Gus&#x2019;s work shows promise. I&#x2019;m not sure I can say the same about his daubings&#x2014;most odd.</i> <br> <i>Speaking of young painters, we have just made an astounding discovery. Remember it was Gus&#x2019;s cousin who lured us to Paris in the first place. Well, it turns out that I have a relative here as well&#x2014;a distant cousin. When we were about to leave for Paris my mother told me that we had family members who had settled there when the family left the turmoils in Eastern Europe. My grandfather came to America and my great-uncle&#x2019;s family went to Paris. Mama had no current address for them but their last name would have been Goldfarb like ours. I asked at several synagogues but to no avail&#x2014;in fact the Parisian Jews did not exactly extend the welcome mat. Well, I admit that I do not look like the good traditional Jewish woman, nor do I practice my religion, but it turned out that the cause of their caution had more to do with the current wave of anti-Semitism that has swept this city, culminating in the dreadful treatment of Captain Dreyfus&#x2014;falsely imprisoned and shipped to Devil&#x2019;s Island mainly because of his race.</i> <br> <i>Having heard this, we&#x2019;re not sure how long we&#x2019;ll stay, though of course among the more bohemian community of artists and writers, race, gender, or even appearance don&#x2019;t matter a fig. Talent is all that counts. You&#x2019;ll be amazed to learn that I was the first of us to have a talent acknowledged here. We went to a soiree and were each instructed to write a poem. I read mine with great trepidation but it was pronounced good. At this gathering I was instantly drawn to a young man with an interesting face and such soulful dark eyes&#x2014;clearly also Jewish. We started to share information about our ancestry and lo and behold he turned out to be my long-lost distant cousin, Maxim Noah. Apparently his mother was a Goldfarb. His parents are dead, and he lives in a studio with artist friends up on the hill called Montmartre. And the poets I met have invited me to join their group. It seems that in this city poetry is as important as painting. Did you ever imagine that such a place could exist on earth? If it weren&#x2019;t for the anti-Semitic sentiment and for missing our delightful godson Liam, we might never want to come home!</i> <br> <i>But I digress. As I mentioned, Maxim lives with some other young artists up in the rural part of Montmartre and invited us to visit him. &#x201c;Primitive&#x201d; is hardly the word to describe it, my dear. No heat, no running water, just a group of young men painting, creating, disc...</i></p><h2>TEARS OF RAGE</h2><p>The authors relate the story of their son&#39;s abduction and murder</p><p>In this aptly titled book, John Walsh traces the steps that led him from being a grieving father to becoming a grieving father who hosts TV's <i>America's Most Wanted</i>, the Fox true-crime show that hunts down bad guys every week through a toll-free tip line. Walsh, however, seems ambivalent about the fame he's been granted. He presents a somewhat halting, uncertain narrative in this autobiography (cowritten with Susan Schindehette), and he makes it clear all the way through that his life is really only driven by one thing: the still-unsolved 1981 abduction and murder of his 6-year-old son, Adam.<p> Walsh's anger and frustration over a "bumbling" police investigation of his son's murder is evident throughout. According to Walsh, the Hollywood, Florida, Police Department should have arrested a drifter named Ottis Toole--a convicted serial killer who played sidekick for many years to the notorious killer Henry Lee Lucas. Walsh speculates that the police had "formed their own ideas" about who killed Adam and didn't want to believe Toole could have been responsible. But Walsh is convinced, and he presents a large amount of evidence to support his case. Unfortunately, it's too late: Ottis Toole died several years ago in prison.</p><p> This is not an easy book to read, and one imagines it wasn't an easy book for John Walsh to write, as he describes, with a staccato style reminiscent of Jack Webb, the probable sequence of events of Adam's disappearance as well as the manner of his death. The bulk of <i>Tears of Rage</i> concerns Adam's abduction and its aftermath and the impact the Walsh family has had since in helping to pass various victims' and children's rights legislation. <i>--Tjames Madison</i></p>As the host of the immensely popular <i>America's Most Wanted,</i> John Walsh has been instrumental in the capture of nearly four hundred and fifty of this country's most dangeroues fugitives. However, few know the full story of the personal tragedy behind his public crusade: the 1981 abduction and murder of his six-year-old son, Adam. Here, for the first time, Walsh, his wife Rev�, and their closest friends tell the wrenching tale of Adam's death -- and the infuriating conspiracy of events that have kept America's No. 1 crime fighter from obtaining justice and closure for himself and his family. <p>"I've never really spoken about these things to anyone before, but I want to talk about Adam before he died. I want people to know just exactly how horrible it is to lose your child, how painful it is. But I also want to talk about how people can help you, and how you can help yourself. About how to come to terms with life when you think you're dying of a broken heart." -- John Walsh </p><p>"I remember thinking, 'our son's been murdered, and now we've got to be the ones to do something about it' It was a sad thing for this country that the fight had to be led by two broken-down parents of a murdered child. But we had to, because no one else was going to do it." -- Rev� Walsh</p></p><h2>Dragon&#39;s Ransom, No. 16</h2><p>The reader&#39;s decisions will determine whether the treasure needed to pay the Golden Dragon who controls the land of Oon will be gathered in time.</p><p></p><h2>Special Forces Survival Guide</h2><p>Special Forces units are trained to stay alive in the most difficult conditions.

("For the rest of my life I would search for another god to eclipse him.") She is charmingly straightforward about her many affairs and just as openly discusses her eight marriages and ever-close family. She also tells her side of the famous slapping incident with a Beverly Hills cop last year. In the end, Gabor comes across as a frank, spontaneous woman who craves intimacy, excitement and power but tends to fall in love with difficult men, most notably professional cad George Sanders. A bonus for the reader are the sometimes pathetic come-on lines she has been subjected to by rich and famous men. For example, running into Gabor on the street in Manhattan, CBS head William Paley once suggested spending the afternoon in bed together, which she was inclined to do, but then he offended her, and botched the affair, by promising her a TV show if she would.

There is that. And getting all Pollyanna-ish is certainly premature.<br><br>But things can change. Sometimes very quickly and for the better.<br><br>As we wrote this book, we had to run hard just to keep up, as governments the world over complicated our writing with a European ban on noxious flame-retardant chemicals in televisions, Canadian legislative changes to put the kibosh on toxic baby bottles and, after a prolonged drought, a new U.S. law (signed by George Bush, no less) restricting hormone-mimicking ingredients in the plastic of children&#x2019;s toys. That&#x2019;s a lot of action in six months.<br><br>And as we started to catch the first glimmers of our elected leaders getting their collective act together, many people began systematically purging their homes of suspect consumer products to make way for safer alternatives.<br><br>The tide has started to turn. With surging public awareness quickly pushing the issue of toxic chemicals up the societal priority list, we set out to design something that would contribute, in some small way, to this awakening.<br><br>This is more than a book. It&#x2019;s kind of a big, unprecedented, adult science fair project. In the tradition of <i>Super Size Me </i>and Michael Moore, we investigated by doing. It&#x2019;s an unorthodox (&#x201c;cuckoo,&#x201d; in the words of some of our loved ones) and very personal examination of the chemicals in our own bodies and the lives of our families. Along the way we&#x2019;ve confronted the companies that made the chemicals, interviewed the government regulators who looked the other way while problems mounted and met the scientists and community organizers who are making a difference.<br><br>In our day jobs we&#x2019;re long-standing environmental advocates in Canada. We toil away in the trenches, trying to secure better government policy to protect the environment and human health. The idea for this book came out of that work, and specifically from Environmental Defence Canada&#x2019;s Toxic Nation project, a campaign to expose the dangers of pollution through testing Canadians for measurable levels of toxic chemicals in their bodies.<br><b>A New Kind of Pollution<br></b>Far from being the rock or island in the Simon and Garfunkel song, it turns out that the best metaphor to describe the human body is &#x201c;sponge.&#x201d; We&#x2019;re permeable. We&#x2019;re absorbent. And Toxic Nation tries to measure the nasty things the human sponge has soaked up. Like efforts in the United States and Europe, the Toxic Nation project applies scientific testing techniques &#x2013; previously restricted to the pages of obscure scientific journals &#x2013; to the raging public debate about what pollutants we are exposed to, in what amounts and from which sources &#x2013; and tells us what we can do about it. Since 2005 Environmental Defence Canada has tested the blood and urine of more than 40 Canadians for over 130 pollutants. People from all walks of life. Of all ages. Men, women and kids from different parts of the country and different ethnic backgrounds. They all turned out to be polluted to some degree.<br><br>As we chatted about the implications of these findings with the test volunteers, the media covering the story and the members of the public who took notice, it became clear that the whole concept of &#x201c;pollution&#x201d; that we carry around in our heads needed updating.<br><br>Belching smokestacks. Sewer outfalls. Car exhaust. For most people these are the first images that come to mind when the word &#x201c;pollution&#x201d; is mentioned. It&#x2019;s still seen as an external concern. Something floating around in the air or in the nearest lake. Out there. Something that can still be avoided.<br><br>As our Toxic Nation testing makes clear, however, the reality is quite different. Pollution is now so pervasive that it&#x2019;s become a marinade in which we all bathe every day. Pollution is actually inside us all. It&#x2019;s seeped into our bodies. And in many cases, once in, it&#x2019;s impossible to get out.<br><br>Baby bottles. Deodorants. A favourite overstuffed sofa. These items, so familiar and apparently harmless, are now sources of pollution at least as serious as the more industrial-grade varieties described above. The market-leading baby bottles in North America are made of polycarbonate plastic, and they leach bisphenol A, a known hormone disruptor, into their contents. Deodorants &#x2013; and nearly every other common product in the bathroom &#x2013; can contain phthalates (pronounced &#x201c;tha-lates&#x201d;), which have been linked to a number of serious reproductive problems. Phthalates are also a common ingredient of vinyl children&#x2019;s toys. Sofas and other upholstered products contain brominated flame retardants and are coated with stain-repellent chemicals, both of which increase the risk of cancer and are absorbed by anyone sitting on a sofa or chair to watch Friday night TV.<br><br>We found all of these chemicals, and many more, in the bodies of the Canadians we tested.<br><br>The truth of the matter is that toxic chemicals are now found at low levels in countless applications, in everything from personal-care products and cooking pots and pans to electronics, furniture, clothing, building materials and children&#x2019;s toys. They make their way into our bodies through our food, air and water. From the moment we get up from a good night&#x2019;s sleep under wrinkle-resistant sheets (which are treated with the known carcinogen formaldehyde) to the time we go to bed at night after a snack of microwave popcorn (the interior of the bag being coated with an indestructible chemical that builds up in our bodies), pollution surrounds us.<br><br>Far from escaping it when we shut our front door at night, we&#x2019;ve unwittingly welcomed these toxins into our homes in countless ways. In a particularly graphic example, it&#x2019;s been estimated that by the time the average woman grabs her morning coffee, she has applied 126 different chemicals in 12 different products to her face, body and hair.<br><br>And the result? Not surprisingly, a large and growing body of scientific research links exposure to toxic chemicals to many ailments that plague people, including several forms of cancer, reproductive problems and birth defects, respiratory illnesses such as asthma and neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).<br><br>We have all become guinea pigs in a vast and uncontrolled experiment.<br><br>At this moment in history, the image conjured up by the word &#x201c;pollution&#x201d; is just as properly an innocent rubber duck as it is a giant smoke stack. The first chapter of this book makes this case by giving a whirlwind history of pollution and examining how humanity&#x2019;s ability to poison itself has changed from a local, highly visible and acute phenomenon to a global, largely invisible and chronic threat. A threat very often coming from everyday household products.<br><br>***<br><br><b>Back-of-the-Envelope Planning<br></b>As I waited for Tony Clement&#x2019;s announcement in that hotel basement, I was also thinking about writing this chapter. Clement&#x2019;s press conference took place only a few weeks after my self-experimentation with BPA. So there I was, waiting for his speech to begin, getting distracted by wondering what my BPA results were going to look like.<br><br>Our BPA experiment was, truth be told, a bit of a pioneering venture. Sure, there&#x2019;s been testing for BPA in the bloodstreams of people around the world. But no one has actually been dumb enough to try to seek out higher BPA levels through a variety of deliberate actions. With BPA &#x2013; unlike phthalates, triclosan and mercury, where we had at least some scientific experiments to guide us &#x2013; we were breaking completely new ground.<br><br>In designing the experiment I&#x2019;d first called up the BPA guru himself, Dr. Fred vom Saal, to pick his brain. After laughing out loud when I told him my intentions, he started musing with me about how it could be done. I filled him in on what we already had in mind for the phthalates experiment: an initial period of &#x201c;detox&#x201d; to depress my phthalates levels, urine collection of this lowered level 24 hours later and then a second collection 24 hours after that, to see the effect of my phthalates exposure.<br><br>&#x201c;Sounds okay,&#x201d; vom Saal responded. &#x201c;The BPA experiment will be similar, and you can probably do it at the same time. Because the half-life of a BPA molecule in the human body is relatively short, give yourself 18 to 24 hours to try to flush it from your system. The other thing you should do to get rid of the BPA in your system is to avoid showering. It&#x2019;s in surface waters and you want to avoid inhaling the steam.&#x201d;<br><br>No shower for two days? No problem, I thought. That&#x2019;s more common on busy, kid-filled weekends than I care to admit.<br><br>&#x201c;Then you should move into the deliberate exposure phase of the experiment. You&#x2019;re going to want to eat foods that are as rich in BPA as possible. Canned foods are ideal.&#x201d; Vom Saal told me he could help prepare a shopping list, based on the relative levels of BPA in different canned goods that he has measured. The makings for a Meal from Hell (as I came to call it).<br><b>Coffee Troubles<br></b>As I explained in Chapter 2, I decided to go two whole days eating food that had not come into contact with plastic, to try to depress levels of BPA and phthalates in my body. I won&#x2019;t duplicate that explanation here, but let me tell you that the cruellest blow came when the no-plastics rule disrupted my daily coffee intake. My original plan was to forego my morning coffee from coffeemakers both at home and a...</p><h2>The Loved Dog</h2><p>A Hollywood dog trainer draws on her scientific studies with dogs to explain how to use non-violent, wolf-inspired methods in order to bond with and train canine companions, in a guide that reveals how to employ non-aggressive, play-based techniques that elicit desirable dog behaviors. 75,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Tamar Geller </b>created, owns, and operates The Loved Dog&#x2122;, Southern California's first cage-free doggy boarding and day care center.

It's the trunk of the tree, and all other behaviors are like branches growing outward from there. Many trainers think the first training step is to put a leash or choke chain around your dog's neck, take him outside, and teach him to heel. But if he doesn't even know how to sit, how will you get his attention in the midst of a million smells, sounds, and motions all distracting him, making you the least interesting influence in his environment? You must establish a connection with your dog, and the first step is teaching him how to sit. When your dog feels secure with you as his leader, he'll be happy to stay close and follow your lead as you introduce new challenges. Teaching your dog to sit without force or a leash is easy since it is something that he does naturally. </p><p> I recently worked with a two-month-old white Doberman puppy named Flash. I guess his owner, Eddie, was expecting a burly male trainer with a bag of torture devices and a rough demeanor. What he got instead was a petite woman with a bag of treats and a penchant for "making a party" every time his dog did something right. </p><p> "Does he know how to sit?" I asked, ignoring Eddie's obvious disappointment in meeting me. </p><p> Eddie sniffed. "Of course. There's no need to start there. Flash sits in every corner of the house all day long. I need him to learn to heel! When I take him for a walk, he pulls me down the street. How can I stop him?" </p><p> Since Eddie and his wife had three children, I crouched on the floor at the height of the youngest child and asked the dog to sit. He looked at me like he'd never heard the word before, since he thought that "sit" only happened when someone stood to face him. It took him twenty minutes, but when he finally got it, I went to town "making a party," feeding him a luscious jackpot and using my voice as if it were confetti. </p><p> "Flash didn't really know how to sit, did he?" asked Eddie sheepishly. </p><p> "No, he didn't," I said. "Do you see why I didn't want to take him outside to heel first? He needs the foundation of 'sit.' Then we can teach him anything." </p><p> I'm sure you can appreciate how amusing and satisfying it was to see Eddie, a grown man in a suit and tie, lying on the kitchen floor beside me, "making a party" for Flash! </p><p> I remember when I first picked up Duke from the vet and took him to Covenant House. Although he was excited to perform a variety of exercises, when we asked him to sit, he ignored us. I realized that his previously broken legs made sitting on request uncomfortable, so I showed the teens in the program how to do what I call "passive training." It requires no effort -- only awareness and treats. </p><p> Each time Duke sat on his own accord, we praised him with a treat and enthusiastically sang out the word "sit!" as if he had just climbed Mt. Everest. Kids are wonderfully open about using their voices melodically, and so after a few "singing lessons" with these talented young adults, with no force or pressure, Duke learned to sit when he was asked. What's more, sitting became his favorite thing to do, because he loved the big fuss they made. </p><p> Many years ago I went to observe a class that was held at a local pet store. One of the dogs, a German shepherd, refused to sit. While each owner was practicing with his own dog in the class area, the trainer decided to help the shepherd get over his "stubbornness." But no amount of choking, jerking his neck, or verbally commanding and shaming would convince the dog to sit. The trainer did every abusive thing she could think of, including poking and pushing with all her weight on the dog's rump. He still refused to sit, and after a stressful and violent session, he ended up biting the trainer on her hand. Fearing for the dog's life, I got his owner's number and called a few days later. </p><p> "How is your dog doing?" I asked. </p><p> "He's with the vet," said the owner. </p><p> "Why? Are you going to give him up?" I asked. </p><p> "No," the owner informed me. "He had an abscess on his rear end and he's getting treatment for it." The poor dog was suffering with a painful abscess, but he had no way to tell anyone. When he just couldn't take it anymore, he finally reverted to biting as self-preservation. </p><p> I've seen so many people turn the other way when their dog is giving them a clear message that something is wrong. I once watched a terribly disturbing segment on CNN that profiled a woman who sat by while a so-called dog trainer beat her seven-month-old German shepherd puppy to death because he was too rambunctious to obey. The owner said that the trainer gave her the following heads-up: "Your puppy may cry, try to escape, or pee when I'm training him, but that's all normal." </p><p> Give me a break! There is <i>nothing</i> normal about those behaviors. If you are doing everything right and your dog refuses to do something, don't beat him up. If he refuses to do something and there is no apparent reason why, I recommend taking your dog to the vet for a checkup. If he gets a clean bill of health, then take him home and start the training all over again. But you should never revert to pushing, shoving, or pressing on your dog to get him to sit. When you force your dog into a position, the stress involved will inhibit his ability to learn and figure it out for himself, not to mention the mental and physical abuse you are inflicting upon him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> <b>THE MAGNET</b> </p><p> The easiest way to teach a dog to sit is a method I call "the magnet." Hold a treat in your hand, covering it with your fingers. Make sure that nothing sticks out, so the dog can't steal it, and move it back over the dog's head, toward his tail. The dog will follow it with his head back as if your hand is a magnet. Because of the way a dog is built, lifting the treat from his nose up slightly toward the top of his head will get him to sit. In this kind and gentle way, I can instantly move 99.9 percent of dogs into the sit position without a word or a touch. </p><p> Holding the treat too high is a common mistake. One pointer's owner kept holding his hand so high above his dog's head that the dog had to jump to get to the treat. I found out pretty quickly that he was afraid that his dog would nip at him. As a result, every time the dog reached for the treat with his mouth, the owner jerked his hand back. The dog must have been thinking, <i>This jumping business is fun! It's so easy to snatch that treat from you.</i> As you can imagine, his jumping skills improved while his sitting skills all but disappeared. I needed to stop the work and focus on helping the owner get rid of his fears of being nipped. Then we had to change the hand signal for sit, since the dog thought that meant to jump on his owner. It took only one day to resolve this issue, and the pointer was well on his way to becoming a well-mannered dog. Remember that if you're doing the magnet and your dog is jumping to get the treat, you're probably holding your hand too high. If he's backing away instead of sitting, practice the sit against a wall, so he has nowhere to go. </p><p> Be encouraging, patient, and sweet throughout the learning process, and remember to keep your fingers securely wrapped around the treat. If even a corner is showing and available to your dog, he will try reaching up and grabbing it from underneath. Never underestimate his intelligence to figure out how to get what he wants. As soon as your dog sits, give him the treat and introduce him to the word "sit" in a happy singsong voice, repeating the word over and over: "Sit, sit, sit." </p><p> Like the example above, first I teach the pattern, and only afterward do I give it a name. Let your voice show your dog that you approve and are impressed with his genius behavior. Soon you'll see your dog thinking, <i>Boy, am I a good people trainer! Each time I sit, I get a goody, so I'll do it as much as I can!</i> Now your dog is asking you to train him! Kids as young as two or three can practice this. It will teach them to be calm around the dog, and it can help kids who are afraid of dogs to overcome their fears. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> <b>THE THREE LEVELS OF SIT</b> </p><p> The lesson is not over once your dog has learned that "sit" means "putting his tush on the ground." As Eddie discovered with his Doberman, Flash, many dogs only respond to "sit" when their owner is standing up. Years ago, at a seminar for dog trainers, the instructor asked the participants to stand up and ask their dog to sit. The trainers scoffed at how ridiculous and elementary that request was. The feeling around the room was "Come on, we're professional dog trainers!" </p><p> Undeterred the instructor then asked everybody to lie down on the floor and tell their dog to sit. Can I tell you how many confused dogs were running around, trying to figure out what their owner was asking of them? The dogs thought that "sit" meant that when the person in front of them stood, they would drop their tushes to the ground. But if the owners didn't give them the usual physical cue, the dogs were confused. Even the most savvy of professional trainers can fall into the trap of thinking that he is teaching the dog one thing when in fact he is teaching him something else. This is why I advise you to generalize each exercise as much as possible. Your dog will learn to recognize the signal that you are giving him rather than just the context in which you usually give it. </p><p> If you wonder why on Earth you should teach your dog to sit while you're lying down, think about different scenarios in which you might be on the floor -- playing with your children, practicing your yoga routine, or hanging out on the lawn with friends. Wouldn't it be nice to enjoy what you're doing and know that you still have control as the leader? You'll never have to worry that your dog will climb all over you. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> <b>TEACH SIT FROM A STANDING POSITION</b> </p><p> Since we need to train the dog to sit from all levels, let's start with the easiest -- the standing position. I always start with the easiest first, so the dog's success will bolster his confidence f...</p></p><h2>Brunner the Bounty Hunter (Warhammer Omnibus)</h2><p>Omnibus edition collecting all three novels in the Brunner the Bounty Hunter series.

Their mission: to offer the most prestigious position in the very center of European scientific life to a man who had just six years before been a mere patent clerk. Albert Einstein accepted, arriving in Berlin in March 1914 to take up his new post. In December 1932 he left Berlin forever. &#x201c;Take a good look,&#x201d; he said to his wife as they walked away from their house. &#x201c;You will never see it again.&#x201d;<br><br>In between, Einstein&#x2019;s Berlin years capture in microcosm the odyssey of the twentieth century. It is a century that opens with extravagant hopes--and climaxes in unparalleled calamity. These are tumultuous times, seen through the life of one man who is at once witness to and architect of his day--and ours. He is present at the events that will shape the journey from the commencement of the Great War to the rumblings of the next one. <br><br>We begin with the eminent scientist, already widely recognized for his special theory of relativity. His personal life is in turmoil, with his marriage collapsing, an affair under way. Within two years of his arrival in Berlin he makes one of the landmark discoveries of all time: a new theory of gravity--and before long is transformed into the first international pop star of science. He flourishes during a war he hates, and serves as an instrument of reconciliation in the early months of the peace; he becomes first a symbol of the hope of reason, then a focus for the rage and madness of the right. <br><br>And throughout these years Berlin is an equal character, with its astonishing eruption of revolutionary pathways in art and architecture, in music, theater, and literature. Its wild street life and sexual excesses are notorious. But with the debacle of the depression and Hitler&#x2019;s growing power, Berlin will be transformed, until by the end of 1932 it is no longer a safe home for Einstein. Once a hero, now vilified not only as the perpetrator of &#x201c;Jewish physics&#x201d; but as the preeminent symbol of all that the Nazis loathe, he knows it is time to leave.</p><p>Thomas Levenson is an Emmy and Peabody award-winning documentary filmmaker whose credits include a two-hour biography of Einstein for the PBS series <i>Nova</i>.

He lives outside Boston.<b>Chapter One<br><br>"Suspicion against every kind of authority"<br><br></b>The Berlin suburb of Dahlem remains a pretty place, quiet, dominated by its university and the science institutes renamed after the disasters of two World Wars in honor of Max Planck. In 1914 it was less than an hour by train on a good day from the heart of Berlin, and its houses are large and comfortable, ideal for a professor and his family. On his arrival, Einstein moved into an apartment in one of those houses, a flat that his wife, Mileva, had chosen on a visit the previous winter. She and their two sons, aged twelve and four, joined him in mid-April, two weeks later. That household was to survive less than four months.<br><br>Marriages end. People once consumed with love grow older, more distant. In this, Einstein and Mileva made a relentlessly ordinary couple. They married; they separated; eventually (despite Einstein's promise to the contrary) they divorced. At first glance, only the speed of the collapse surprises. In Zurich, the Einsteins had seemed to be a functioning family. In Berlin, within weeks, Einstein refused to remain in the same building as his wife. It was no coincidence that the break coincided with the move. A transition that had first appeared as a simple career boost became, or he used it, as the chance to forge a much deeper breach with his past. He had married Mileva at the tail end of a tumultuous adolescence. Moving to Berlin at the near edge of midlife, Einstein found that he could--or would--no longer tolerate the consequences of that choice. Arrival in Berlin was not merely a beginning; it marked the dismal end of a drama in which Einstein had once been the hero.<br><br>Albert Einstein was born in the south German city of Ulm in 1879, the first child of Hermann and Pauline Einstein. Hermann came from Buchau, a small town in WYrttemberg, one of the petty Germany states. He was one of what were known as the "meadow Jews," from long-established communities scattered through the small towns and farm villages of south Germany. There had been Einsteins, originally Ainsteins, in Buchau since 1665, but by the time of Hermann's birth in 1847, small-town routines had begun to crumble. The emancipation of Germany's Jews had begun in the wake of Napoleonic reforms, though it took until 1862 for the kingdom of WYrttemberg to grant its Jewish subjects full civil rights. For Hermann, the first step was to attend secondary school in a big city--Stuttgart. He did well there, showing a marked mathematical bent, but his family was large and his two sisters needed dowries, so university was out of the question. Faced with the need to make a living, he abandoned Buchau, this time for the old cathedral city of Ulm, where he sold feathers for mattress stuffing. There, in 1876, he married a young woman--a teenager--named Pauline Koch. They remained in Ulm until 1881, when the young family moved to Munich.<br><br>Hermann had married up. The Koch family had been small-town merchants, but they made their move sooner and more aggressively than the Einsteins had. Pauline's father and uncle had entered the wholesale grain trade in the 1850s, building a business near Stuttgart that ultimately became a government supplier. The Kochs educated their daughters. Pauline was thus relatively rich, raised to city customs, sophisticated and smart; eleven years younger than her husband, she nonetheless was the sparking center of her household. She became pregnant in 1878, and almost from the moment that Albert emerged, she fixed on him all the ambition a bright, ambitious young mother could bring to bear.<br><br>Einstein inspired some worry early on--his grandmother complained that baby Albert was "fat, much too fat," and he was slow to speak. Family legend had it that he remained silent until his third year, when he finally came out with complete sentences. His first recorded utterance came when he was two. Pauline was pregnant with her second child and Einstein was promised a toy when mother and baby came home from the hospital. On seeing his sister, Maja, for the first time, he is supposed to have asked "But where are its wheels?" He could be a willful child, prone to tantrums that could extend to the point of real violence. He struck out at his sister, once trying to drive a hole in her skull with a toy hoe, and he valiantly resisted the first imposition of formal education, finally striking his tutor with a chair. The woman fled in horror, never to be seen at the Einstein house again. But Albert was Pauline's prize, and she would persuade, flatter, labor as necessary to nurture him. Maja remembered her mother sitting for hours at the piano coaxing, cajoling and ultimately compelling the cantankerous six- and seven-year-old Albert through his violin practice, until finally the boy discovered his genuine love of the instrument. Behavior like this did not go over well at school. At the start, Maja recalled, he was "considered only moderately talented, because he needed time to mull things over, and he wasn't even good at arithmetic, in the sense of being quick and accurate." Unfortunately, in Einstein's first encounter with modern German methods of instruction, his teacher held his pupils' attention by rapping the knuckles of any child who did not answer fast or precisely enough to please him. Einstein suffered.<br><br>But not too much. Despite Maja's claim, Einstein was always capable of fine performance, to his mother's immense satisfaction. In his first year of elementary school, when he was seven, she wrote to a relative that "Albert got his grades yesterday. He was ranked first again." The myths that Einstein did poorly at school or that he failed mathematics are only that--myths. With a few exceptions, his marks ranged from good to excellent from primary school into university--and that included creditable work in fields far removed from those he truly cared for. He performed acceptably in the required Greek and Latin lessons at gymnasium, and at university he followed his father's wishes that he gain at least a sliver of useful knowledge by taking--and passing--business classes like Banking and the Stock Exchange and the Mathematical Foundations of Statistics and Personal Insurance. There is no evidence that he ever made any significant use of what he learned in those courses, but the image of Einstein on Wall Street has its charms.<br><br>But while Pauline could boast of his ability there was always cause for concern. Even as a small child, Einstein could not hide his contempt for whatever seemed to him arbitrary, coercive or simply stupid in school. For example, Bavaria required all students to take religious instruction, so despite his parents' lack of interest in Judaism, the nine-and-a-half-year-old dutifully began to study with a more pious relative. Almost immediately, he found himself entranced by Jewish tradition, a devotion that lasted about two years. He refused to eat pork, composed religious songs to sing on his way to school, and pondered the biblical stories of creation and miracles. But when he turned eleven he received as a gift Aaron Bernstein's series of popular science books--brightly illustrated introductions to the big ideas of the day. The shock was enormous and immediate. More than half a century later, Einstein recalled that he read the Bernstein series "with breathless attention," and that "through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true. The consequence was a positively fanatic orgy of freethinking, coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies."<br><br>Einstein went on to write that this loss of faith was "crushing," and that "suspicion against every kind of authority grew out of this experience, a skeptical attitude towards the convictions which were alive in any specific social environment--an attitude which has never again left me . . ." The immediate consequence of this revelation came in secondary school, where he found himself virtually at war with the faculty at Munich's prestigious Luitpold Gymnasium. As he remembered it decades later, the school had been a maelstrom of arrogance and stupidity, its acts of intellectual violence directed at his independence of mind and will, committed not only by the school but by the state of which it was an arm.<br><br>One almost pities his teachers. As Maja recalled, one of his instructors lost patience one day and snapped that nothing would ever become of him. When Einstein complained that he had done nothing wrong, the teacher replied that it was impossible to lead a class with him in the room because his attitude lacked the required respect. He hated being treated like this. "The style of teaching in most subjects was repugnant to him," Maja wrote, adding that "the military tone of the school, the systematic training in the worship of authority that was supposed to accustom pupils at an early age to military discipline was also particularly unpleasant for the boy."<br><br>The crisis came in 1894, when his parents, uncle and sister moved first to Milan, then to Pavia, in northern Italy, so that Hermann Einstein and his brother could establish a new business there. Einstein remained behind with distant relatives to complete his schooling at the gymnasium. He fought yet again with one of his instructors, and using the incident as a pretext, he persuaded his family doctor to write a note saying he was suffering from an unspecified nervous ailment that prevented him from attending school. He left Munich, made his way to Italy, arrived at his parents' house without warning, and announced his decision to them: he was going to renounce his German citizenship. Statelessness was preferable to allegiance to a Germany he already disdained.<br><br>There was a little more to the story, of course. Einstein had a very practical motive for escape. If he remained in Munich past his sixteenth birthday he was subject to conscription into the imperial army. Shoul...</p><h2>Legendary</h2><p>A heart to protect. A debt to repay. A game to win.

Meow - Meow - Meow!</b><br><br>Oh, Se�or Don Gato was a cat.<br>On a high red roof Don Gato sat. . . . <br><br>When Se�or Don Gato receives an ardent love letter from the fluffy white lady cat, a dramatic chain of events is set into motion. There&#x2019;s a tragic fall off the roof, a heart-rending death scene, a village thrown into mourning for its fallen hero . . . and then love, returned to life and triumphant. Lively and full of fun, John Manders&#x2019;s illustrations capture delightful details of Spanish architecture and customs, while a costumed cast of cats acts out the well-known children&#x2019;s song with comically melodramatic flair.</p><p>John Manders works out of his studio in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, creating artwork for picture books. Of SE�OR DON GATO, he says, "This Spanish folk song tells a richly detailed story through what is left out of the lyrics. Since Don Gato&#x2019;s character is never specifically described, I had the wonderful task of imagining this larger-than-life character in pencil and paint."Kindergarten-Grade 2-Ah, Senor Don Gato! He is an urbane and charming feline, a Falstaff of cats, at home in his portly physique and quite confident of his charm and allure. Sure enough, a lovely white fluff ball of a lady cat is smitten. Her note to Don Gato so delights her swain that he jumps for joy-right off the roof, breaking his knee, ribs, and whiskers, "And his little solar plexus." That looks like the end, and his fellow felines put him into a pine box. Followed by his weeping sweetheart, the cortege heads for the cemetery. On the way, they pass the fish market, the lovely smell revives the dead, and all ends happily. This traditional English version of a Mexican rhyme has rhythm and pulse. It reads aloud well, and is beautifully extended by Manders's sun-drenched gouache illustrations. The gold tones give the effect of a trip to the south, and the humorous cartoon style gives viewers a Don Gato of charm and substance.

This account of her extraordinary solo journey tells of her resourcefulness in the face of personal dangers and unexpected encounters. Dervla Murphy has also written &#34;In Ethiopia with a Mule&#34;, &#34;Muddling through in Madagascar&#34;, &#34;Eight Feet in the Andes&#34;, &#34;On a Shoestring to Coorg&#34;, &#34;The Waiting Land&#34; and &#34;Where the Indus is Young&#34;.</p><p>Dervla Murphy is one of the very best loved of travel writers. She was born in County Waterford and since 1964 has been regularly publishing accounts of her journeys - by bicycle and on foot -- in the remoter areas of four continents. She has also written about the problems of Northern Ireland, the hazards of nuclear power, and race relations in Britain. The Times Literary Supplement called her &#39;an admirable woman -- she has a romantic soul and a keen eye&#39;.This book recounts a trip, taken mostly on bicycle, by a gritty Irishwoman in 1963. Her route was through Yugoslavia, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and ended in New Delhi. She carried a pistol, got sunstroke, and suffered the usual stomach disorders. She endured bad accommodations but reaped much local hospitality, too, including a dinner with the Pakistani president. Most of the book concerns the high mountain country of Afghanistan and Pakistan. First published in England in 1965, the book is neither current, nor quite old enough to be of much historical interest. Nonetheless, it is a spirited account, suitable for larger public library collections. Unfortunately, it lacks illustrations, and the two maps included give us little idea of the remote areas she visited. Harold M. Otness, Southern Oregon State Coll.

Set in the 1970s in Pittsburghs Hill District, and depicting gypsy cabdrivers who serve black neighborhoods,&nbsp;Jitney&nbsp;is the seventh in Wilsons 10-play cycle (one for each decade) on the black experience in twentieth century America. He writes not about historical events or the pathologies of the black community, but, as he says, about the unique particulars of black culture . . .

Joshua is a competent, level-headed boy who works hard, loves his mother, and keeps God in his heart. Despite the bigotry of the trail boss, the Captain, Joshua is determined to prove himself on his first drive. Through encounters with rustlers and others, stampedes, crew frictions, and the multitude of difficulties and challenges inherent in the job, Joshua holds his own, proves his worth, and earns some respect from the Captain. Myers tells a compelling story in which the source of the drama is the drive itself, and all the hardship of life on the trail. Scene after scene is vividly told, including a downright gory, fatal trampling of one of the cowpunchers during a stampede. Readers gain a real feeling for the period and setting, and a strong sense of what a cattle drive entailed. The hallmarks of Myers's workthorough research and solid writingare evident here.

Fire on the Horizon, written by veteran oil rig captain John Konrad and longtime Washington Post journalist Tom Shroder, recounts in vivid detail the life of the rig itself, from its construction in South Korea in the year 2000 to its improbable journey around the world to its disastrous end, and reveals the day-to-day lives, the struggles, and ambitions of those who called it home. From the little-known maritime colleges to Transocean's training schools and Houston head-quarters to the small towns all over the country where the wives and children of the Horizon's crew lived in the ever-present shadow of risk thousands of miles away, Fire on the Horizon offers full-scale portraits of the Horizon's captain, its chief mate, its chief mechanic, and others. What emerges is a white-knuckled chronicle of engineering hubris at odds with the earth itself, an unusual manifestation of corporate greed, and the unforgettable heroism of the men and women on board the Deepwater Horizon, culminating in the harrowing minute-by-minute account of the fateful day, April 20, 2010, when the half-billion-dollar rig blew up, taking the lives of eleven people with it and leaving behind a swath of unprecedented natural destruction.</b></p><h2>The Trigger: Hunting the Assassin Who Brought the World to War</h2><p>On a summer morning in Sarajevo almost a hundred years ago, a teenager took a pistol out of his pocket and fired not just the opening rounds of the First World War but the starting gun for modern history. By killing Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Gavrilo Princip, started a cycle of events that would leave 15 million dead from fighting between 1914 and 1918 and proved fatal for empires and a way of ruling that had held for centuries.<br><br><i>The Trigger</i> tells the story of a young man who changed the world forever. It focuses on the drama of the incident itself by following Prinip&#x2019;s journey.

Traveling through the Balkans on Princip&#x2019;s trail, and drawing on his own experiences there as a war reporter during the 1990s, Butcher unravels this complex part of the world and its conflicts, and shows how the events that were sparked that day in June 1914 still have influence today.

Her recommendations are followed by millions today. She is the leading spokesperson for the organic foods movement. She is known for popularizing the phrase &#x201c;You Are What You Eat&#x201d;. When you see organic food stores all over and special organic foods shelves in supermarkets, think of Adelle Davis as the person who popularized all of this. Her movement became popular because of the increased use of pesticides, chemicals, additives and fertilizers to increase food production. Davis wrote a series of four books, starting with a cookbook in 1947, that ultimately sold over 10 million copies in total. Although her ideas were considered somewhat eccentric in the 1940s and 1950s, the change in culture with the 1960s brought her ideas, especially her anti-food processing and food industry charges, into the mainstream in a time when anti-authority sentiment was growing. She also contributed to, as well as benefited from, the rise of a nutritional and health food movement that began in the 1950s, which focused on subjects such as pesticide residues and food additive. During the 1960s and 1970s, her popularity continued to grow, as she was featured in multiple media report. Her celebrity was demonstrated by her repeated guest appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, as she became the most popular and influential nutritionist in the country.</p><p>She was born in Lizton, Indiana on February 25, 1904. Her first book was Optimum Health published in 1935. This book did not have a publisher. The first book to make her famous was a cook book published in 1947: Let&#39;s Cook it Right. This was followed by Let&#39;s Have Healthy Children (1951) and Let&#39;s Eat Right to Keep Fit (1954).

His famous gardens at Great Dixter draw people from around the world. His name is kept in the forefront of people&#39;s minds with constant media exposure including his weekly articles for Country Life, written since 1963 without an issue missed.</p><p>Christopher Lloyd&#39;s love of and pride in gardening is evident in every word of this often-republished gardening classic. It&#39;s not an encyclopedic text, as much of it is specifically applicable to Lloyd&#39;s damp English climate, but as he says in his new introduction, &#34;We should always keep an open mind.&#34; Gardeners in many climates will do well with the plants Lloyd loves, and everyone can follow his advice on the basics of growing and propagating healthy plants."The Well-Tempered Garden is for gardeners who have not been dragged into this pursuit but are here because they love it." So writes Christopher Lloyd in the Introduction to this superb book. Here the beginning gardener will learn the basic skills of planting, pruning, weeding, staking, and deadheading. More advanced gardening enthusiasts are guided through ways to propagate plants, to select and care for different kinds of plants - perennials, shrubs, climbers, bulbs - and are also offered ideas about the many different kinds of gardens one might keep. He offers advice on roses, vegetables, fruits, ornamental plants, wild gardening in grass, and more.A strong-minded instructor, Lloyd knows that errors are inevitable, and rather than scolding encourages learning through experience. He opens our eyes to the beauty of the unexpected surprises that happen in the garden, whether on the part of the "fallible plant" or the "fallible gardener." All this from the man Henry Mitchell called "possibly the best garden writer alive." (6 X 9, 480 pages, illustrations)<br></p><h2>Condominium</h2><p>John D.

From the plein-air landscapes first painted near the forests of Barbizon outside Paris, through the fields of Giverny that Monet immortalized, to the art of American expatriates such as John Singer Sargent and the European-trained American nativists like William Merritt Chase, the influence of impressionism on American art has had a long and distinguished history.<br>Through artistic principles developed by Charles Hawthorne, an influential American impressionist and educator who studied with Chase and founded The Cape Cod School of Art, the rich legacy of the impressionist tradition was passed on to several generations of twentieth-century American artists.<br>In <b>Painting the Impressionist Landscape</b>, Lois Griffel, the current director of The Cape Cod School of Art and an accomplished artist in her own right, explores and illustrates Hawthorne&#x2019;s philosophy and theories about color and light, enabling artists at every level of ability and experience to apply his insights to their own work.<br>The first part of the book, &#x201c;Fundamentals of Color and Light,&#x201d; elaborates on the circumstances and individuals that contributed to the development of impressionism. The author then outlines the progression of the study of color and light that is covered in detail later in the book, from simple block studies&#x2014;the most effective way to learn to use pure color to express the effects and quality of light&#x2014;through the more complex rounded forms in still lifes and portraits, to the most challenging forms intrinsic to landscape.<br>Griffel then discusses the essentials of color&#x2014;its terms, the impressionist palette, and color mixing&#x2014;as well as how established color theory expresses and influences the impressionist approach.<br>The second part of the book, &#x201c;Impressionism in Practice,&#x201d; takes readers through a series of explorations that guides them toward a mastery of the impressionist landscape. Griffel begins by itemizing the materials that artists need to prepare for painting outdoors and describing how the light of the setting affects color within the context of a composition. The detailed chapters on the studies&#x2014;from sunny day and cloudy day blocks, to still lifes and portraits, culminating in landscapes&#x2014;are all structured to lead readers through each step, enabling them first to evaluate, then eventually realize in their own painting, Hawthorne&#x2019;s enlightening perceptions about capturing the radiance of nature's light in art.<br>Beautifully illustrated with the art of the author, her colleagues at the artist&#x2019;s colony in Provincetown, and selections by Monet, Sargent, and Hawthorne himself, <b>Painting the Impressionist Landscape</b> is a lively and informative guide to expressing light as color in art.</p><p><b>Lois Griffel</b>&#x2019;s lifelong interest in art began at the age of five, when she first entertained neighborhood children with her drawings and paintings. She discovered early in her career that she enjoyed teaching and attended Southern Connecticut State College in order to receive her bachelor of science degree in education. Later, while making her living as a portrait painter, she enrolled at the Art Students League and the National Academy of Design in New York, where she studied with many outstanding artists, including Everett Raymond Kinstler and Harvey Dinnerstein. Her introduction in the early 1970s to Henry Hensche, Charles Hawthorne&#x2019;s prot�g�, led to her in-depth study and practice of the impressionist theory of painting. As director and instructor at The Cape Cod School of Art, it gives her great joy to combine her loves of teaching and painting, and to share them with enthusiastic students. Ms. Griffel has had a number of one-person exhibitions throughout New England, and has been included in invitational exhibitions in New York, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Carmel, California. She holds workshops in landscape, portrait, and figure painting throughout the northeast.</p><h2>Eyes of Eagles</h2><p>Jamie Ian MacCallister, an orphan raised by Indians, ventures into Texas and becomes a scout for the volunteer force battling the Mexican army at the Alamo.</p><p>Strong, brave and wise beyond his years, Jamie MacAllister either impresses or angers all he meets. Kidnapped at age seven by Ohio Shawnees, Jamie's will and strength soon gain him both the favor of Chief Tall Bull, who adopts him, and the enmity of Tall Bull's other son, Little Wolf, the first of many who wish to bring Jamie down a notch. Escaping to a nearby Kentucky settlement, he makes still more enemies. After Jamie kills John Jackson's son in self defense, he must flee west with his beloved, Kate Olmstead--ironically, the daughter of another enemy--where they marry and are besieged by Shawnees, the Jacksons and bounty hunters--most of whom eventually die by Jamie's hand. The two then settle in East Texas, where Jamie is pressed into service to fight in the coming war with Mexico. Jamie serves with distinction and manages to escape the massacre at the Alamo. Alas, at war's end, he and his bride must still elude those thirsting for their blood. Johnstone ( Fury in the Ashes ), on rare occasion, molds history to fit his tale. However, neither these liberties, nor the one-dimensional characters dampen this rousing, two-fisted saga of the growing American frontier. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ransom: A Novel</h2><p>In his first novel in more than a decade, David Malouf&#x2014;arguably Australia&#x2019;s greatest living writer&#x2014;gives us a stirring reimagination of one of the most famous passages in all of literature: Achilles&#x2019; rageful slaughter and desecration of Hector, and Priam&#x2019;s attempt to ransom his son&#x2019;s body in Homer&#x2019;s <i>The Iliad</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>A moving novel of suffering, sorrow and redemption, <i>Ransom</i> tells the story of the relationship between two grieving men at war: fierce Achilles, who has lost his beloved Patroclus in the siege of Troy; and woeful Priam, whose son Hector killed Patroclus and was in turn savaged by Achilles. Each man&#x2019;s grief must confront the other&#x2019;s for surcease and resolution: a resolution more compelling to both than the demands of war.

He lives in Australia.I<br><br>The sea has many voices. The voice this man is listening for is the voice of his mother. He lifts his head, turns his face to the chill air that moves in across the gulf, and tastes its sharp salt on his lip. The sea surface bellies and glistens, a lustrous silver-blue-a membrane stretched to a fine transparency where once, for nine changes of the moon, he had hung curled in a dream of pre-existence and was rocked and comforted. He hunkers down now on the shelving pebbles at its edge, bunches his cloak between his thighs. Chin down, shoulders hunched, attentive.<br><br>The gulf can be wild at times, its voices so loud in a man's head that it is like standing stilled in the midst of battle. But today in the dawn light it is pondlike. Small waves slither to his sandalled feet, then sluice away with a rattling sound as the smooth stones loosen and go rolling.<br><br>The man is a fighter, but when he is not fighting he is a farmer, earth is his element. One day, he knows, he will go back to it. All the grains that were miraculously called together at his birth to make just these hands, these feet, this corded forearm, will separate and go their own ways again. He is a child of earth. But for the whole of his life he has been drawn, in his other nature, to his mother's element. To what, in all its many forms, as ocean, pool, stream, is shifting and insubstantial. To what accepts, in a moment of stillness, the reflection of a face, a tree in leaf, but holds nothing, and itself cannot be held.<br><br>As a child he had his own names for the sea. He would repeat them over and over under his breath as a way of calling to her till the syllables shone and became her presence. In the brimming moonlight of his sleeping chamber, at midday in his father's garden, among oakwoods when summer gales bullied and the full swing of afternoon came crashing, he felt himself caught up and tenderly enfolded as her low voice whispered on his skin. Do you hear me, Achilles? It is me, I am still with you. For a time I can be with you when you call.<br><br>He was five then, six. She was his secret. He floated in the long soft swirlings of her hair.<br><br>But she had warned him from the beginning that she would not always be with him. She had given him up. That was the hard condition of his being and of all commerce between them. One day when he put his foot down on the earth he knew at once that something was different. A gift he had taken as natural to him, the play of a dual self that had allowed him, in a moment, to slip out of his hard boyish nature and become eel-like, fluid, weightless, without substance in his mother's arms, had been withdrawn. From now on she would be no more than a faint far-off echo to his senses, an underwater humming.<br><br>He had grieved. But silently, never permitting himself to betray to others what he felt.<br><br>Somewhere in the depths of sleep his spirit had made a crossing and not come back, or it had been snatched up and transformed. When he bent and chose a stone for his slingshot it had a new weight in his hand, and the sling had a different tension. He was his father's son and mortal. He had entered the rough world of men, where a man's acts follow him wherever he goes in the form of story. A world of pain, loss, dependency, bursts of violence and elation; of fatality and fatal contradictions, breathless leaps into the unknown; at last of death-a hero's death out there in full sunlight under the gaze of gods and men, for which the hardened self, the hardened body, had daily to be exercised and prepared.<br><br>A breeze touches his brow. Far out where the gulf deepens, small waves kick up, gather, then collapse, and new ones replace them; and this, even as he watches, repeats itself, and will do endlessly whether he is here or not to observe it: that is what he sees. In the long vista of time he might already be gone. It is time, not space, he is staring into.<br><br>For nine years winter and summer they have been cooped up here on the beach, all the vast horde of them, Greeks of every clan and kingdom, from Argos and Sparta and Boeotia, from Euboea, Crete, Ithaca, Cos and the other islands, or like himself and his men, his Myrmidons, from Phthia. Days, years, season after season; an endless interim of keeping your weapons in good trim and your keener self taut as a bowstring through long stretches of idleness, of restless, patient waiting, and shameful quarrels and unmanly bragging and talk.<br><br>Such a life is death to the warrior spirit. Which if it is to endure at the high point needs action-the clash of arms that settles a quarrel quickly, then sends a man back, refreshed in spirit, to being a good farmer again.<br><br>War should be practised swiftly, decisively. Thirty days at most, in the weeks between new spring growth and harvest, when the corn is tinder-dry and ripe for the invader's brand, then back to the cattle pace of the farmer's life. To calendar days and what comes with them; to seedtime and ploughing and the garnering of grain. To tramping in your old sandals across sunstruck fields, all dry sticks and the smell of wild mint underfoot. To sitting about in the shade doling out the small change of gossip, and listening, while flies buzz and the sweat streams from your armpits, to interminable disputes-the administering of justice on home ground. To pruning olives, and watching, over months, the swelling of a broodmare's belly or the sprouting of the first pale blade among sods. To noting how far a son has grown since last year's notch on a doorjamb.<br><br>In these nine years his own son, Neoptolemus, away there in his grandfather's house, has been growing up without him. Days, weeks, season after season.<br><br>The sun is climbing now. He pushes to his feet. Stands for a last moment filled with his thoughts; his mind, even in its passive state, the most active part of him. Then, head down, his cloak drawn close about him, starts back along the sloping beach towards the camp.<br><br>There is a singing in the air, so high-pitched that it might be spirits. It comes from the rigging of the ships that swing at anchor, recent arrivals, or are drawn up in pinewood cradles along the strand. There are more than a thousand of them. Their spars, in silhouette against the pallid sky, are like a forest magically transported. After so many months ashore, their hulls are white as bone. They stretch in a line back to the camp, and on the sea side make one of its walls.<br><br>He moves quickly now, it is cold out of the sun. Walking awkwardly against the slope of the beach, he has a drunken gait. His sandals slip on the pebbles, some of which are as large and smooth as duck eggs. Between them, brown-gold bladder-wrack still damp from the tide.<br><br>When the last of the line of ships is behind him, he pauses and takes a long look out across the gulf. The sea, all fire, spreads flat to the horizon. So solid-looking and without depth, so enticing as a place to move to, that a man might be tempted to make a sharp turn right and try walking on it, and only when it opened and took him down discover he had been tricked by a freak of nature.<br><br>But the sea is not where it will end. It will end here on the beach in the treacherous shingle, or out there on the plain. That is fixed, inevitable. With the pious resignation of the old man he will never become, he has accepted this.<br><br>But in some other part of himself, the young man he is resists, and it is the buried rage of that resistance that drives him out each morning to tramp the shore. Not quite alone. With his ghosts.<br><br>Patroclus, his soulmate and companion since childhood.<br><br>Hector, implacable enemy.<br><br>Patroclus had simply appeared one afternoon in his father's court, a boy three years older than himself and nearly a head taller. Thin-jawed, intense, with the hands and feet, already disproportionately large, of the man he was growing into.<br><br>Achilles had been hunting in one of the ravines beyond the palace. He had killed a hare. Great whoops of triumph preceding him, he had come bounding up the steps into the courtyard to show his father what he had got.<br><br>Ten years old. Long-haired, wiry, burnt black by the Phthian sun. Still half-wild. His soul not yet settled in him.<br><br>Peleus was angry at the intrusion. He turned to reprove the boy, but gentled when he saw what it was. He gestured to Achilles to be still. Then, with a small helpless showing of his palms-You see what it is, I too am a fond parent-apologised to his guest, Menoetius, King of Opus, for this unintended discourtesy.<br><br>Achilles, still panting from his long run in across the fields, set himself to be patient. Idly at first, with no intimation of what all this would one day mean to him, assuming still that the centre of the occasion was the hare trailing gouts of blood where it hung from his wrist, he stood shifting from foot to foot, waiting for the visitor's business to be done and his father's attention to be his.<br><br>The story Menoetius had to tell was a shocking one.<br><br>The boy with the big hands and feet was his son, Patroclus. Ten days ago, in a quarrel over a game of knucklebones, he had struck and killed one of his companions, the ten-year-old son of Amphidamas, a high official of the royal court. Menoetius was bringing the boy to Phthia as an outcast seeking asylum.<br><br>In a voice still hollow with wonder at how, in an instant, so many lives could be flung about and broken, the unhappy man led them back to the fatal morning.<br><br>Two players, fiercely engaged in the rivalries of the game, squatting in the shade of a colonnade and laughing. Taunting one another as young boys will. Eyes raised to follow the knucklebones as they climb, with nothing untoward in view.<br><br>For a long moment the taws hang there at the top of their flight; as if, in the father's grave retelling of these events, he were allowing for a gap to be opened where this time round some higher agency might step in and, with the high-handed indifference of those who have infinite power over the world of conjunction and accident, reverse what is about to occur. The silence is screwed...</p><h2>Parliament of Whores: A Lone Humorist Attempts to Explain the Entire U.S. Government</h2><p>Examines every aspect of government, attending a political convention, the presidential election and inauguration, Congress, the Supreme Court and a small town meeting in New Hampshire. He examines the budget, the bureaucracy and the US policies on drugs, poverty, agriculture, defence and foreign affairs. The author also wrote &#34;Modern Manners&#34;, &#34;The Bachelor Home Companion&#34;, &#34;Republican Party Reptile&#34; and &#34;Holidays in Hell&#34;.</p><p>If satirists are at their best when tussling with something they hate, then this is P.J. O'Rourke's masterpiece. He clearly hates government--and has hated it since before it was cool to do so--and for all the right reasons, too: it's clumsy, inefficient, hypocritical, greedy, and arrogant. In other words, it magnifies the faults of the poor saps who staff it. <i>Parliament of Whores</i> is the humorist's howl of bitter laughter at the entire bloated, numskulled mess. As befits an ex-editor of <i>National Lampoon</i>, nothing is out of bounds for O'Rourke. Speaking of the fabled "football"--that satchel that follows the president around 24/7--the author doubts there are really launch codes in there at all--nothing but "a copy of <i>Penthouse</i> and a pint bottle of Hiram Walker--a <i>Penthouse</i> from back in the seventies, when <i>Penthouse</i> was really dirty, I'll bet."<p><i>Parliament of Whores</i> is perfect for anyone who longs to cultivate an entertaining brand of cynicism, to be "a lone voice--not crying in the wilderness, thank you, but chortling in the rec room." O'Rourke is a master at making you laugh in spite of the better angels of your nature, and the only negative thing to be said about this tour de force is that his flamethrower brand of satire leaves nothing in its wake--certainly not the suggestion of an improvement. <i>--Michael Gerber</i></p>Is there anything funny left to say about our government? O'Rourke seems to think so, and here offers a fractured civics lesson in support of his notion that ``freedom is its own best punishment.'' It's hard to disagree with O'Rourke's contempt for the ``boring'' business of ``giving money to jerks''--the main business, he says, of government these days. But his gonzo libertarianism, while suited to the pages of Rolling Stone (where much of this first appeared), is mainly a disguise for lots of familiar right-wing nostrums. Fortunately, O'Rourke bolsters his tired rhetoric with his own brand of inspired anti-reporting, and also with lots of good old name-calling. No civic booster, O'Rourke celebrates our ``national mindlessness'' and our exceptional interest in ``the pursuit of happiness.'' Washington, though, seems dedicated to robbing its citizens, and then doling out the spoils to whoever sticks out his hand and shouts the loudest. O'Rourke's highly selective fact-gathering takes him to the South Bronx with Guardian Angel Curtis Sliwa in order to understand urban poverty; to the D.C. ghetto on a crack bust to witness the war on drugs; to the Department of Transportation to appreciate the folly of bureaucracy; and to Afghanistan (almost) to see US foreign policy in splendid disarray. A stint aboard a missile cruiser reveals his weakness for big weapons--''This is the way to waste government money.'' O'Rourke saves his best shots for ``the Perennially Indignant'' among housing advocates and environmentalists, and kicks around the slimier players in the S&amp;L scandals. But the ``special interest'' group he really slams is us, since all of us manage one way or another to stick our snouts into the government trough. If nothing else, O'Rourke has well earned his place among American humorists as the cracked voice of rock-and-roll Republicanism. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It is the nine justices who too often now decide the controversial issues of our time&#x2014;from abortion and same-sex marriage, to gun control, campaign finance and voting rights. The Court is so crucial that many voters in 2016 made their choice based on whom they thought their presidential candidate would name to the Court. Donald Trump picked Neil Gorsuch&#x2014;the key decision of his new administration.

And while liberals and conservatives disagree about desired results, they are indistinguishable in their view about that primacy. Asked about the premise of my book, <i>The Most Dangerous Branch</i>&#x2014;that the Court, in case after big case, too often acts when it should not&#x2014;a liberal justice and a conservative each gave the same answer: &#x201c;I half-agree with you!&#x201d;* <br> &nbsp;<br> Distrustful of popular will when it&#x2019;s inconvenient, litigants from both sides of the ideological aisle rush to the Court to prosecute grievances or to claim perceived rights that eluded them in Congress (and in state legislatures). Abortion, gun control, campaign finance, gay marriage&#x2014;these are among the difficult issues that the Court chooses to resolve. So we don&#x2019;t bother to fight them in elections &#x2014;the results of which can be overturned the following November&#x2014;when a victory in the Supreme Court can cement an outcome for a lifetime? Why attempt to persuade millions of citizens to endorse a position when all you need is five of nine unaccountable justices? Each time demonstrators convene outside the Court, they surely miss the irony that they&#x2019;re marching right past the Capitol across the street. <br> &nbsp;<br> When the Court anoints itself as arbiter, the winning side exalts the courage of the justices. The losers holler about &#x201c;an imperial judiciary.&#x201d; What exactly is the difference between &#x201c;making the law&#x201d; and &#x201c;interpreting the law&#x201d;? It&#x2019;s merely about whether you like the way the justices voted in today&#x2019;s case. We all favor &#x201c;judicial restraint&#x201d; and oppose &#x201c;judicial activism&#x201d;&#x2014;except, naturally, when we don&#x2019;t, in which case we just call them by the opposite label. &#x201c;Judicial restraint&#x201d;&#x2014;and its cousin, &#x201c;strict construction&#x201d; of the Constitution&#x2014; are the chameleons of American law, instantly able to change philosophical color when expediency requires. &#x201c;Judicial activism&#x201d; is what the other guy does. But in truth, everybody&#x2019;s an activist now. <br> &nbsp;<br> The corrosive result is twofold: an arrogant Court and an enfeebled Congress that rarely is willing to tackle the toughest issues. Each feeds on the other. The justices frequently step in because they believe the members of Congress&#x2014;elected by the people though they may be&#x2014;act like fools or, like cowards, fail to act. Happy to stay off the battlefield, Congress seldom raises a peep, other than to crowd the cameras during occasional Senate confirmation hearings on a new justice. The result is dwindling public faith in both institutions. <br> &nbsp;<br> The triumphalism of the Court&#x2014;its eagerness to be in the vortex of social and political disputes, its wholesale lack of deference to the other branches of government&#x2014;explains in part the cynical uses to which it has been subjected by presidents and senators. That cynicism, masquerading as &#x201c;fidelity to the rule of law,&#x201d; is understandable. But the Court&#x2019;s drop in standing among the public in recent decades&#x2014;the reason opinion surveys and mainstream commentary have so often reflected an attitude that the justices are partisans-in-robes&#x2014;is a mostly self-inflicted wound. Forget the robes&#x2014;maybe the job should come with tights and a cape.<br> &nbsp;<br> That reflects not a liberal or conservative sentiment, but a growing conviction that the Court has squandered its institutional capital. It is altogether possible to be politically liberal and to oppose an aggressive Court. It is entirely consistent to be politically conservative and to oppose an aggressive Court. Political ends do not justify judicial means. <br> &nbsp;<br> Under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., there is a now-ascendant conservative &#x201c;bloc&#x201d; of justices, appointed by Republicans, and there is a liberal &#x201c;bloc,&#x201d; appointed by Democrats. The tendency toward viewing judges as political proxies has only accelerated during the Trump presidency. &nbsp;When journalists write about a justice, they routinely include the party of the president who appointed the justice&#x2014;as if members of the Court were little different than stand-ins at the Department of Agriculture. When the votes of justices in controversial cases can be predicted at the outset, constitutional law simply becomes partisan politics by another name. If you usually know beforehand how justices will come out&#x2014;and if it&#x2019;s a function of the political party of the president who appointed them&#x2014;why have a Court at all?<br> &nbsp;<br> A month before the Constitution was ratified in 1788, Alexander Hamilton explained the source of the new Court&#x2019;s authority. The other branches&#x2014;and the people&#x2014;would obey the Court because of its prestige. Rulings would be based &#x201c;neither on force nor will, but merely judgment,&#x201d; he wrote in Federalist No. 78. The Court lacked infantry and warships. It had no source of revenue except what Congress gave it. By Hamilton&#x2019;s reckoning, whereas the president &#x201c;holds the sword&#x201d; and Congress &#x201c;commands the purse,&#x201d; the U.S. Supreme Court would be &#x201c;the least dangerous branch.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s no longer so. We know that Congress can pass unwise laws. We&#x2019;ve come to realize that a president can initiate foolish wars, abuse his executive authority, and spread lies. But the Supreme Court&#x2019;s power grab in recent decades is more insidious, more destructive of American values in the long term. Impatiently, myopically, with deep distrust in our elected representatives, we have come to believe democracy is broken. And too often we&#x2019;ve come to see the justices as our saviors. With so much dysfunction in government, the justices see themselves that way, too. But we need more politics, not less politics. We do not need, nor should we want, the court to save us from ourselves. <br> &nbsp;<br> Adapted from THE MOST DANGEROUS BRANCH: INSIDE THE SUPREME COURT&#x2019;S ASSAULT ON THE CONSTITUTION Copyright � 2018 by David A.

In the modern democracy that has evolved, that claim is nearly meaningless. During the last generation, a "new politics" has enveloped government that guarantees the exclusion of most Americans from the debate -- the expensive politics of facts and information.<br><br>A major industry has grown up in Washington around what might be called "democracy for hire" -- business firms and outposts of sponsored scholars devoted to concocting facts and opinions and expert analysis, then aiming them at the government. That is the principal function of all those enterprises along Washington's main boulevards like K Street -- the public-relations agencies, the direct-mail companies and opinion-polling firms. All these work in concert with the infrastructure of think tanks, tax-exempt foundations and other centers that churn out reams of policy ideas for the political debate. Most are financed by corporate interests and wealthy benefactors. The work of lobbyists and lawyers involves delivering the material to the appropriate legislators and administrators.<br><br>Only those who have accumulated lots of money are free to play in this version of democracy. Only those with a strong, immediate financial stake in the political outcomes can afford to invest this kind of money in manipulating the governing decisions. Most Americans have neither the personal ability nor the wherewithal to compete on this field.<br><br>The contours of this barrier are embedded in the very texture of everyday political debate itself. Citizens have been incapacitated, quite literally, because they do not speak the language. Modern methodologies of persuasion have created a new hierarchy of influence over government decisions -- a new way in which organized money dominates the action while the unorganized voices of citizens are inhibited from speaking. A lonely congressman, trying to represent the larger public interest, finds himself arrayed against an army of authorities -- working for the other side.<br><br>Beyond the fact of unequal resources, however, lies a more troubling proposition: that democracy is now held captive by the mystique of "rational" policymaking, narrow assumptions about what constitutes legitimate political evidence. It is a barrier of privilege because it effectively discounts authentic political expressions from citizens and elevates the biases and opinions of the elites.<br><br>This mystique, not surprisingly, is embraced and exalted by well-educated citizens of most every persuasion, the people who are equipped with professional skills and expertise, including the dedicated reformers who attempt to speak for the larger public. After all, it is the basis for their own primacy in political action. Yet the premise of rationality, as the evidence demonstrates, is deeply flawed and routinely biased in its applications.<br><br>For those who are active every day in the conventional politics of governing, this proposition may not be so easy to grasp. Indeed, it will seem quite threatening to some of them, for it challenges their own deeply held beliefs about how politics is supposed to work and puts in question the meaning of their own political labors. Ordinary citizens, those who are distant from power, will have much less difficulty seeing the truth of the argument -- that information-driven politics has become a convenient reason to ignore them.<br><br>Jack Bonner, an intense young denizen of K Street, has the squirrelly enthusiasm of a salesman who can't stop talking about his product because he truly believes in it. What Bonner's firm sells is democracy, not the abstract version found in textbooks, but the living, breathing kind that occurs when people call up a senator and tell him how to vote. Bonner &amp; Associates packages democratic expression and sells it to corporate clients -- drug manufacturers and the cosmetic industry, insurance companies and cigarette makers and the major banks.<br><br>Jack Bonner's firm is an exotic but relatively small example of the vast information industry that now surrounds the legislative debate and government in general. You want facts to support the industry's lobbying claims? It pumps out facts. You want expert opinions from scholars? It has those in abundance from the think tanks corporate contributors underwrite. You want opinion polls? It hires polling firms to produce them. You want people -- live voters who support the industry position? Jack Bonner delivers them.<br><br>When the Senate was debating the new clean-air legislation in 1990, certain wavering senators received pleas from the grassroots on the question of controlling automobile pollution. The Big Brothers and Big Sisters of the Mahoning Valley wrote to Senator John Glenn of Ohio. Sam Nunn of Georgia heard from the Georgia Baptist Convention and its 1.2 million members. The Easter Seal Society of South Dakota lobbied Senator Thomas A. Daschle. The Delaware Paralyzed Veterans Association contacted Senator William V. Roth, Jr.<br><br>These groups and some others declared their opposition to the pending clean-air amendment that would compel the auto industry to improve the average fuel efficiency of its cars substantially. The measure would both conserve energy and reduce the carbon-dioxide pollution that is the main source of global wanning. These citizen organizations were persuaded to take a stand by Bonner &amp; Associates, which informed them, consistent with the auto industry's political propaganda, that tougher fuel standards would make it impossible to manufacture any vehicles larger than a Ford Escort or a Honda Civic.<br><br>Vans and station wagons, small trucks and high-speed police cruisers, they were told, would cease to exist. The National Sheriffs Association was aroused by the thought of chasing criminals in a Honda Civic. The Nebraska Farm Bureau said rural America would be "devastated" if farmers tried to pull a trailer loaded with livestock or hay with a Ford Escort.<br><br>For twenty years, whenever the government has attempted to improve auto safety or environmental protection through new regulation, the auto industry has always made similar groans -- satisfying tougher standards would be impossible without dire social and economic consequences. The industry warnings have always proved to be false, but the innocent citizens recruited to speak for Detroit probably didn't know this history.<br><br>Jack Bonner was thrilled by their expressions of alarm and so was the auto industry that paid him for them. Bonner's fee, which he coyly described as somewhere between $500,000 and $1 million, was for scouring six states for potential grassroots voices, coaching them on the "facts" of the issue, paying for the phone calls and plane fares to Washington and hiring the hall for a joint press conference.<br><br>"On the clean-air bill, we bring to the table a third party -- 'white hat' groups who have no financial interest," Bonner explained. "It's not the auto industry trying to protect its financial stake. Now it's senior citizens worried about getting out of small cars with walkers. Easter Seal, Multiple Sclerosis -- a lot of these people have braces, wheelchairs, walkers. It's farm groups worrying about small trucks. It's people who need station wagons to drive kids to Little League games. These are groups with political juice and they're white hot."<br><br>In the textbook version of democracy, this activity is indistinguishable from any other form of democratic expression. In actuality, earnest citizens are being skillfully manipulated by powerful interests -- using "facts" that are debatable at best -- in a context designed to serve narrow corporate lobbying strategies, not free debate. Bonner &amp; Associates does not start by looking for citizens whose self-interest might put them on the auto industry's side. It starts with a list of the senators whose votes the auto industry needs. Then the firm forages among those senators' constituents for willing bodies.<br><br>"We sit down with the lobbyists and ask: How much heat do you want on these guys?" Bonner explained. "Do you want ten local groups or two hundred groups? Do you want one hundred phone calls from constituents or a thousand phone calls?"<br><br>Bonner's K Street office has a "boiler room" with three hundred phone lines and a sophisticated computer system, resembling the phone banks employed in election campaigns. Articulate young people sit in little booths every day, dialing around America on a variety of public issues, searching for "white hat" citizens who can be persuaded to endorse the political objectives of Mobil Oil, Dow Chemical, Citicorp, Ohio Bell, Miller Brewing, U.S. Tobacco, the Chemical Manufacturers Association, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association and dozens of other clients.<br><br>This kind of political recruiting is expensive but not difficult. Many of the citizens are no doubt flattered to be asked, since ordinary Americans are seldom invited to participate in a personal way in the larger debates, even by the national civic organizations that presumably represent them. In a twisted sense, Jack Bonner does what political parties used to do for citizens -- he educates and agitates and mobilizes.<br><br>Since members of Congress are not naive, they understand the artificiality well enough. They know that many of the 400 million pieces of mail they receive each year are contrived by interested parties of one kind or another. Heating authentic voices from the grassroots, however, provides them with a valuable defense on controversial votes, especially when a senator intends to vote with the auto-industry lobbyists and against cleaner air. Public opinion, as every senator knows, is with the air.<br><br>"Obviously," Bonner said, "you target senators inclined to go your way but who need some additional cover. They need to be able to say they've heard from people back home on this issue. Or we target people who are genuinely undecided. It's not a good use of money to target senators who are flat opposed or who are already for you."<br><br>Corporate grassroots politics, as Bonner likes to emphasize, is really borrowed from the opposition -- the citizen "public interest" organizations, especially in the environmental movement, who first perfected the technique of generating emotional public responses with factual accusations. "Politics turns on emotion," Bonner said. "That's why industry has lost in the past and that's why we win. We bring emotion to the table."<br><br>The democratic discourse is now dominated by such transactions -- information and opinion and scholarly expertise produced by and for the self-interested sponsors. Imagine Bonner's technique multiplied and elaborated in different ways across hundreds of public issues and you may begin to envision the girth of this industry. Some firms produce artfully designed opinion polls, more or less guaranteed to yield results that suggest public support for the industry's position. Some firms specialize in coalition building -- assembling dozens or hundreds of civic organizations and interest groups in behalf of lobbying goals.<br><br>This is democracy and it costs a fortune. Democracy-for-hire smothers the contemporary political debates and, while it does not always prevail, relatively few Americans have the resources to hire a voice for themselves. David Cohen of the Advocacy Institute, which trains citizens in how to lobby for their causes, recognizes a kind of class system emerging in the political process itself. "We are moving to a system," he said, "where there are two different realms of citizens -- a society in which those with the resources are going to have the ability to dominate the debate and outcomes while others are not going to be able to draw on the tools of persuasion." If democratic expression is reduced to a question of money, then those with money will always have more.<br><br>In previous times, reformers wrote devastating critiques about the "capture" of government regulatory agencies by the industries they were supposed to regulate. The Civil Aeronautics Board became the puppet of the airlines. The Bureau of Mines was owned by the coal industry. The Federal Communications Commission belonged to the broadcasters. The occasional expos�s sometimes produced reforms though the basic problem endured.<br><br>Now, however, it is not an exaggeration to say that democracy itself has been "captured." The forms of expression, the premises and very language of debate, not to mention the rotating cadres of experts and managers, are now owned in large measure by relatively few interests, much the way that powerful industries came to own regulatory agencies. Democracy is held captive, not just by money, but by ideas -- the ideas that money buys.<br><br>Some citizens have discovered that the best way to avoid being overwhelmed by the "shadow government" of K Street is to proceed stealthfully in the legislative arena -- to launch sneak attacks before the information industry notices.<br><br>Year after year through the 1980s, Representative Byron Dorgan of North Dakota pursued this lonely strategy, as he tried to get Congress to curb the profligate buildup of junk bonds and corporate debt. As a former state tax commissioner, Dorgan understood that the Wall Street takeover deals were cannibalizing productive companies and leaving U.S. corporations dangerously overleveraged. Junk bonds didn't become a visible political issue until they started collapsing in the late 1980s, threatening the solvency of S&amp;Ls, banks and insurance companies. But Dorgan could have explained it to people years before.<br><br>"I've been giving Wall Street fits," he said, "and they're furious with me and my constituents don't quite understand why I care because we're not exposed to hostile takeovers and stuff like that in North Dakota. But, starting in 1982 when I saw what was happening on Wall Street, I just got much more interested in junk bonds and mergers."<br><br>Dorgan set out to eliminate the federal tax deductions for the interest paid on junk bonds -- the implicit federal subsidy for the deals that made the explosive buildup of corporate debt possible. If these tax breaks could be removed or scaled back, Wall Street would find fewer opportunities for raiding companies and breaking them up or leaving them mired in debt.<br><br>But the congressman did not launch a noisy campaign to alert the public to the threat posed by junk bonds. Nor did he push the Ways and Means Committee on which he serves to take up the matter directly. He did not make speeches or call press conferences. Dorgan knew all those would be futile -- and would simply alert the opposition to his intentions.<br><br>Instead, Representative Dorgan practiced the kind of guerrilla politics that is sometimes possible in the parliamentary confusions of Congress. He literally tried to sneak his amendments into tax measures before the other side found out about them. These were like midnight forays against the opposing army of lobbyists and financial experts (and sometimes even occurred late at night when legislators were weary and the army was asleep). Sometimes, he even succeeded.<br><br>Byron Dorgan's personal campaign against junk bonds illustrates how much the legislative process has been distort...</p><h2>The Web</h2><p>During a visit to scientist-philanthropist Woodrow Wilson Moreland on an exotic Pacific island, psychologist Alex Delaware encounters a group of secretive houseguests, terrifying noctural vistors, and dark secrets from the past that threaten the lives of Alex and Robin Castagna. 225,000 first printing.</p><p>Another gripping Alex Delaware novel from Kellerman, the king of psychological suspense and author of ten successive New York Times bestsellers.

Together they ride through tall fields of corn and race across&nbsp;green pastures, chasing cattle under summer skies. But now the land is devastated by a terrible drought. Like many farmers, Leah's papa faces losing the family farm. Without corn to sell, he cannot repay his loan from the bank, which has put his farm and equipment up for auction. But when the auction day arrives, the crowd is surprised by the sight of Leah, who makes a bid for her father's tractor. She has raised the money by selling something very precious--her pony. Set in the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, Elizabeth Friedrich's deeply felt story, vividly portrayed through Michael Garland's stunning oil paintings, tells of one child and what she would sacrifice for love of her family.</p><p><b>Elizabeth Friedrich </b>is a prolific author whose books celebrate religious values.

Leah's parents are farmers in the Great Plains of the 1930s. Amid locusts and drought, their bank forecloses on its loan, ordering a farm auction. Leah sells her beloved pony and uses the money to bid one dollar for her father's tractor. No one has the heart to outbid her. Her action inspires others at the auction to buy the rest of the goods for ridiculously low-dusty bids and return everything to Leah's family. The oil paintings with subdued color values have great intensity, especially several that catch their subjects full-face and frozen at the peak of strong emotional reactions. Impact is enhanced by the starkness of the setting and the illustrations' stillness. This is a far cry from the brightness of Garland's My Cousin Katie (Crowell, 1989; o.p.). Friedrich adds a one-page historical note describing the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression, and "penny" farm auctions. A moving, effective sketch of a child's bravery and its power to trigger generosity in the adults around her.?

But when the girl is found dead, clearly stabbed to death, Claudia Leonardo suddenly becomes Brunetti&#39;s case, no longer Paola&#39;s student. Claudia seems to have no discernible living family - her only familial relationship is with an elderly Austrian woman, who was the lover of her grandfather, but was not herself Claudia&#39;s grandmother. Brunetti is both intrigued and stunned by the extraordinary art collection the old woman keeps in her small, unprepossessing flat, and when she in turn is found dead, the case seems to have be about to open up long buried secrets of collaboration and the exploitation of Italian Jews during the war, secrets few in Italy are happy to explore...</p><p>Donna Leon has lived and taught English literature in Switzerland, Iran, China, Italy and Saudi Arabia.

Starting from Plato&#x2019;s fateful division of the world into spirit and matter, her analysis of how patriarchal Western philosophy and religion have used language and science to bolster their power over both women and nature is brilliant and persuasive, coming alive in poetic prose.<br>Griffin draws on an astonishing range of sources from timbering manuals to medical texts to Scripture and classical literature in showing how destructive has been the impulse to disembody the human soul, and how the long separated might once more be rejoined. Poet Adrienne Rich calls <i>Woman and Nature</i> perhaps the most extraordinary nonfiction work to have merged from the matrix of contemporary female consciousness a fusion of patriarchal science, ecology, female history and feminism, written by a poet who has created a new form for her vision. ...The book has the impact of a great film or a fresco; yet it is intimately personal, touching to the quick of woman&#x2019;s experience.&#x201d;</p><p>"<b>Woman and Nature</b> is about memory and mutilation, female anger as power, female presence as transforming force. . . . Griffin has collected here the most apparently disparate materials [from lumbering manuals to poetry to gynecology texts] into an extraordinary collage which, for all the research and hard intellectual work underlying it, becomes an intense physical experience."<br>-- Adrienne Rich<br><br>"My journey through the strange and familiar worlds of <b>Woman and Nature</b> has been strengthening and enspiriting. It is a book which I will read and re-read, assign to classes, give to friends. It is a work of great and daring vision."<br>-- Mary Daly<br><br>"<b>Woman and Nature</b> is my favorite -- in my opinion the best -- feminist book of the past twenty-five years. The prose is stunning: this is a book to be read aloud with friends."<br>-- Carol P.

But with the fall of the Soviet Union, they began to spread across the continent, then the world, turning whole populations into vampires--or human cattle. Having overrun India, the far East, and the great cities of North and South America, the forces of Night are now spreading into the countryside to consolidate their conquest.<br>In a town on the New Jersey shore, the vampires have just arrived, along with their human henchmen, the cowboys, who round up human cattle for the overlords in return for the promise of eternal life---later. For the vampires wish only a few of their own kind to rule, and feed. The rest of humanity are to be helpless herds, the source of the blood of life. <br>Falsely accused of abuse, Father Dan is drunk in a basement waiting for the end. His superior has betrayed the local Catholic congregation and become a vampire. Sister Carolyn has become a formidable killer of cowboys and vampires. Dan's niece, escaped from the conquest of New York, has made her way south to find him. Brought together by Rabbi Zev Wolpin, who is shaken by the vampires' fear of the cross and holy water, they plan their resistance. Against all odds, they discover that there just might be a way for humanity to <i>really</i> fight back. But first they will have to kill the vampire king of New York.</p></p><p><p><b>F.

He lives in Wall, New Jersey.</p>1<br>ZEV...<br>Gasping in horror and revulsion, Zev Wolpin stumbled away from St. Anthony&#x2019;s Church. He stretched his arms before him, reaching into the dark for something, anything, to support him before he fell.<br>Leaves slapped his face, twigs tugged at his graying beard as he plowed into foliage. His bike...where was his bike? He thought he&#x2019;d left it in a clump of bushes, but obviously not this clump. Had to find it, had to get away from this place. But the dark made him disoriented...the dark, and what he&#x2019;d just witnessed.<br>He&#x2019;d heard whispers, stories he couldn&#x2019;t, wouldn&#x2019;t, believe, so he&#x2019;d come to see for himself, to prove them wrong. Instead...<br>Zev bent at the waist and retched. Nothing but a bubble of bile and acid came up, searing the back of his throat.<br>The whispers were only partly true. The truth was worse. The truth was unspeakable.<br>He straightened and looked around in the darkness. Wan light from the crescent moon in the cloud-streaked sky made the shadows deeper, and Zev feared the shadows. Then he spotted a curving glint of light from the chrome on his bike&#x2019;s front wheel. He ran to it, yanked it by the handlebars from its hiding place, and hopped on.<br>His aging knees protested as he pedaled away along dark and silent streets lined with dark and silent houses, heading south when he should have been going west, but <i>away</i> was all that mattered now.<br>Lakewood was a small town, maybe ten miles from the Atlantic Ocean; a place where the Rockefeller family was said to have vacationed. So it didn&#x2019;t matter much if he headed south or north, he wouldn&#x2019;t be far from the place he now called home. The town was once home to fifty thousand or more before the undead came. Now he&#x2019;d be surprised if there were a thousand left. He&#x2019;d heard it was the same all up and down the East Coast.<br>The exertion helped clear his mind. He had to be careful. Prudent he hadn&#x2019;t been. In fact, he&#x2019;d been downright reckless tonight, venturing out after sundown and sneaking up on St. Anthony&#x2019;s. <i>Schmuck</i>! What had he been thinking? He prayed he didn&#x2019;t pay for it with his life. Or worse.<br>He shuddered at the thought of ending up the victim in a ceremony like the one he&#x2019;d witnessed tonight. He had to find temporary shelter until dawn. Even then he wouldn&#x2019;t be safe, but at least there wouldn&#x2019;t be so many shadows.<br>The blue serge suit coat that had once fit rather snugly now hung loose on his half-starved frame and flapped behind him as he rode. He&#x2019;d had to punch new holes in his belt to hold up the pants. He&#x2019;d complained so often about not being able to lose weight. Nothing to it, really. Simply don&#x2019;t eat.<br>His ever-hungry stomach rumbled. How could it think of food after what he&#x2019;d just seen?<br>A shadow passed over him.<br>A blast of cold dread banished any concern about his next meal. His aging neck protested as he glanced up at the sky, praying to see a cloud near the moon. But the glowing crescent sat alone in a clear patch of night.<br>No! Please! He increased his speed, his legs working like pistons against the pedals. Not a flying one!<br>Zev heard something like a laugh above and behind him. He ducked, all but pressing his face to the handlebars. Something swooped by, clawing at the back of his coat as it passed. Its grip slipped but the glancing impact was enough to disrupt Zev&#x2019;s balance. His front wheel wobbled, the bike tipped to the left and hit the curb, sending him flying.<br>Zev landed hard on his left shoulder, his lungs emptying with a grunt. His momentum carried him onto his back. What he saw circling above him made him forget his pain. He rolled over and struggled to his feet. He instinctively checked the yarmulke clipped to his thinning gray hair, then gripped the cross dangling from a string around his neck. That might save him in close quarters, but not from a creature that could swoop down from any angle. He felt like a field mouse under the cold gaze of a hawk.<br>He started running. He didn&#x2019;t know where he was going but knew he had to move. The bike was no good. He needed a tight space where his back was protected and he could use the cross to keep his attacker at bay. One of these houses, maybe. A basement, even a sewer drain&#x2014;anyplace but out here in the open where&#x2014;<br>&#x201c;Here! Over here!&#x201d;<br>A woman&#x2019;s voice, calling in a stage whisper to his left. Zev looked across an overgrown lawn, saw only a large tree, a pine of some sort with branches almost brushing the ground.<br>&#x201c;Quick! In the tree!&#x201d;<br>A trap maybe. A team this could be&#x2014;a winged one driving prey into the arms of another on the ground. He&#x2019;d never heard of anything like it, but that meant nothing.<br>A glance over his shoulder showed him that the creature had half folded its wings and was diving his way from above. No choice now. Zev veered left for the tree and whatever waited within its shadowed branches.<br>He was almost there when the woman&#x2019;s voice shouted, &#x201c;Down!&#x201d;<br>Zev obeyed, diving for the grass. He heard a hiss of rage, felt the wind from the creature&#x2019;s wings as it hurtled past no more than a foot or two above him. He lurched back to his feet and staggered forward. Pale hands reached from the branches and pulled him into the shadows.<br>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; the woman said.<br>He couldn&#x2019;t see her&#x2014;she was a shadow among the shadows&#x2014;but her voice sounded young.<br>&#x201c;Yes. No. If you mean am I hurt, No.&#x201d;<br>But all right? No, he was not all right. Never again would he be all right.<br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; She grabbed his hands and pressed them against a tree limb. &#x201c;Hold on to this branch. Steady it while I try to break it. Quick, before it makes another pass.&#x201d;<br>The dead branch sat chest high and felt about half an inch in diameter. With Zev steadying it, the woman threw her weight hard against it. The wood snapped with a loud crack.<br>&#x201c;What are you&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br>She shushed him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming back.&#x201d;<br>She moved to the edge of the trees, carrying the branch with her. Zev watched her, silhouetted against the moonlit lawn. Average height, short dark hair were all he gained about her looks. He saw her crouch, then hurl her branch like a spear at the creature as it swooped by on another pass. She missed and high-pitched derisive laughter trailed into the sky.<br>She returned to Zev, stopped on the other side of the broken branch, and patted the front of his shirt. She pulled him close and whispered in his ear.<br>&#x201c;Your cross&#x2014;tuck it away.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No! It will&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do as I say. They can see in the dark. And try to look frightened.&#x201d;<br>Try? Who had to try?<br>She put an arm around him to hold him close, keeping the branch between them.<br>Another whisper: &#x201c;Pull out that cross when I tell you.&#x201d;<br>Zev had no idea what she was up to but had nowhere else to turn, so...<br>Her grip on him tightened. &#x201c;Here it comes. Ready...&#x201d;<br>Zev could see it now, a dark splotch among the shadows of the branches, wings spread, gliding in low, arms stretched out before it.<br>&#x201c;...ready...&#x201d;<br>Suddenly it folded its wings and shot at them like a missile.<br>&#x201c;Now!&#x201d;<br>As Zev pulled out the cross he felt the woman shove him away. He lost his balance and tumbled back, saw her fall in the other direction, felt a clawed hand grip his shoulder, heard the creature&#x2019;s screech of triumph rise into a wail of shock and agony as it slammed against the trunk of the tree.<br>Zev regained his feet amid the frantic and furious struggling of the hissing creature. Its charging attack had opened a passage through the branches, lightening the shadows. As he ducked its thrashing wings he realized it had impaled itself on the broken branch. It flopped back and forth like a speared fish, then pushed away from the trunk, trying to dislodge itself from the wood that had pierced its chest.<br>Zev turned to run. Now was his chance to get away from this thing. But what of the woman? He couldn&#x2019;t abandon her.<br>He spotted her standing behind the creature. She&#x2019;d hiked up her already short skirt and kicked at the thing&#x2019;s back, shoving it further onto the branch. The creature howled and thrashed, and in its struggles broke the branch off the trunk with a gunshot crack.<br>Free now, it whirled and staggered out into the moonlight. Its wings flapped but couldn&#x2019;t seem to lift it. Perhaps ten feet beyond the branches it dropped to its knees. The woman was right behind it, giving it another kick. It rolled onto its back, clawing at the wooden shaft that jutted two or three feet from its chest. Its movements were weaker now, its wings lay crumpled beneath it. Howling and writhing in agony, it gripped the branch and started to slide it out of its chest.<br>&#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; the woman cried.<br>She gripped the upper end, shoving it back down and leaning on it to hold it in place.<br>&#x201c;This is for Bern!&#x201d; she screamed, naked fury rawing her voice. &#x201c;This is what you made me do to her! How does it feel? How does it <i>feel</i>?&#x201d;<br>For an instant Zev wondered who was more frightening, this screeching woman or the struggling monster she held pinned to the earth.<br>The creature clawed and kicked at her, almost knocking her over. He had to help. If that thing got free...<br>Mouth dry, heart pounding, Zev forced himself from the shadows and added his own weight to the branch. He felt it punch deeper into the thing&#x2019;s chest. Then a sickening scrape as it thrust past ribs and into the ground beneath.<br>The creature&#x2019;s struggles became abruptly feebler. He saw now that it was a female. It might have been beautiful once, but the sickly pallor and the bared fangs robbed it of any attractiveness.<br>Finally it shuddered and lay still. Zev watched in amazement as its wings shriveled and disappeared.<br>&#x201c;<i>Gevalt</i>!&#x201d; he whispered, although he didn&#x2019;t know why. &#x201c;You did it! You killed one!&#x201d;<br>He&#x2019;d heard they could be killed&#x2014;all the old folk tales said they could be&#x2014;but he&#x2019;d never actually seen one die, never even met anyone who had.<br>It was good to know they could be killed.<br>&#x201c;<i>We</i> did.&#x201d; She finally released her grip on the branch but her gaze remained locked on the creature. &#x201c;If you have a soul,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;may God have mercy on it.&#x201d;<br>What was this? Like a harpy, she screeches, then she blesses the thing. A madwoman, this was.<br>She faced him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry for my outburst. I...it&#x2019;s just...&#x201d; She seemed to lose her train of thought, as if something had distracted her. &#x201c;Anyway, thank you for the help.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You saved my life, young lady. It&#x2019;s me who should be thanking.&#x201d;<br>She was staring at him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Rabbi Wolpin, aren&#x2019;t you.&#x201d;<br>Shock stole his voice for a few heartbeats. She knew him?<br>&#x201c;Why...yes. But I don&#x2019;t recognize...&#x201d;<br>She laughed. A bitter sound. &#x201c;Please, God, I hope not.&#x201d;<br>He could see her now. Nothing familiar about her features, no particular style to her short dark hair. He noticed a tiny crescent scar on the right side of her chin. Heavy on the eye makeup&#x2014;very heavy. A tight red sweater and even tighter short black skirt hid little of her slim body. And were those fishnet stockings?<br>A prostitute? In these times? Such a thing he never would have dreamed. But then he remembered hearing of women selling themselves to get food and favors.<br>&#x201c;So, you know me how?&#x201d;<br>She shrugged. &#x201c;I used to see you with Father Cahill.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Joe Cahill,&#x201d; Zev said, feeling a burst of warmth at the mention of his friend&#x2019;s name. &#x201c;I was just over at his church. I saw...&#x201d; The words choked off.<br>&#x201c;I know. I&#x2019;ve&#x2014;&#x201d; She waved her hand before her face. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s starting to stink already. Must be an older one.&#x201d;<br>Zev looked down and saw that the creature was already in an advanced state of rot.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d better get out of here,&#x201d; the woman said, backing away. &#x201c;They seem to know when one of their kind dies. Get your bike and meet me by the tree.&#x201d;<br>Zev continued to stare at the corpse. &#x201c;Are they always so hard to kill?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think the branch went all the way through the heart at first.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;<i>Nu</i>? You&#x2019;ve done this before?&#x201d;<br>Her expression was bleak as she looked at him. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not talk about it.&#x201d;<br>When Zev wheeled his bike back to the tree he found her standing beside a child&#x2019;s red wagon, an old-fashioned Radio Flyer. A book bag emblazoned with <i>St. Anthony&#x2019;s School</i> lay in the wagon. He hadn&#x2019;t noticed either earlier. She must have had them hidden among the branches.<br>She said, &#x201c;You mentioned you were at St. Anthony&#x2019;s. Why?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;To see if what I&#x2019;d heard was true.&#x201d; The urge to retch gripped Zev again. &#x201c;To think that was Father Cahill&#x2019;s church.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t the pastor.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not in name, maybe, but they were his flock. He was the glue that held them together. Someone should tell him what&#x2019;s going on.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh,<br>yes. That would be wonderful. But nobody knows where he is, or if he&#x2019;s even alive.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br>Her hand shot out and gripped his arm, squeezing. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s alive?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Zev said, taken aback by her intensity. &#x201c;At least I think so.&#x201d;<br>Her grip tightened. &#x201c;Where?&#x201d;<br>He wondered if he&#x2019;d made a mistake telling her. He tried not to sound evasive. &#x201c;A retreat house. Have I been there? No. But it&#x2019;s near the beach, I&#x2019;m told.&#x201d;<br>True enough, and he knew the address. After Joe had been moved out of St. Anthony&#x2019;s rectory to the retreat house, he and Zev still shared many phone conversations. At least until the creatures came. Then the phones stopped working and Zev&#x2019;s time became devoted more to survival than to keeping up with old friends.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to find him! You&#x2019;ve got to tell him! He&#x2019;ll come back when he finds out and he&#x2019;ll make them pay!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A <i>mensch</i>, he is, I agree, but only one man.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No! Many of his parishioners are still alive, but they&#x2019;re afraid. They&#x2019;re defeated. But if Father Joe came back, they&#x2019;d have hope. They&#x2019;d see that it wasn&#x2019;t over. They&#x2019;d regain the will to fight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Like you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m different,&#x201d; she said, the fervor slipping from her voice. &#x201c;I never lost the will to fight. But my circumstances are special.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not important. <i>I&#x2019;m</i> not important. But Father Joe is. Find him, Rabbi Wolpin. Don&#x2019;t put it off. Find him tomorrow and tell him. When he hears what they&#x2019;ve done to his church he&#x2019;ll come back and teach them a lesson they&#x2019;ll never forget!&#x201d;<br>Zev didn&#x2019;t know about that, but it would be good to see his young friend again. Searching him out would be a <i>mitzvah</i> for St. Anthony&#x2019;s, but might be good for Zev as well. It might offer some shape to his life...a life that had devolved to mere existence, an endless, mind-numbing round of searching for food and shelter while avoiding the creatures by night and the human slime who did their bidding during the day.<br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Zev said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try to find him. I won&#x2019;t promise to bring him back, because such a decision will not be mine to make. But I promise to look for him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tomorrow?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;First light. And who should I say sent me?&#x201d;<br>The woman turned away and shook her head. &#x201c;No one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t tell me your name?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not important.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you seem to know him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Once, yes.&#x201d; Her voice grew thick. &#x201c;But he wouldn&#x2019;t recognize me now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You can be so sure?&#x201d;<br>She nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve fallen too far away. There&#x2019;s no coming back for me, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d;<br>She&#x2019;d been through something terrible, this one. So had everyone who was still alive, including Zev, but her experience, whatever it was, had made her a little <i>meshugeh</i>. More than a little, maybe.<br>She started walking away, looking almost silly dragging that little red wagon behind her.<br>&#x201c;Wait...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just find him,&#x201d; she said withou...</p><h2>Public Assembly Venue Management: Sports, Entertainment, Meeting, and Convention Venues</h2><p>From the International Association of Venue Managers comes an introduction to the industry and business practices of public assembly.

However, certain core principles underlie the management of all of them. Public Assembly Venue Management explores these fundamental principles while also providing detailed information about specific types of venues and situations. Topics covered include the history of public venues as well as business management and finance, ticketing, safety and security, and booking. Additionally, detailed examples of invoices, rental agreements, and financial statements illustrate the real-world situations managers can expect to address. Suitable for both graduate and undergraduate courses, this textbook has been designed to address the needs of students and faculty in such disciplines as sports management, event management, and hospitality. Professionals interested in entering the industry or expanding their knowledge will also find Public Assembly Venue Management a valuable resource for their professional development.</p><p>Dr. Mahoney is currently an assistant professor in sport management at the University of New Haven College of Business, teaching primarily in the areas of event and venue management.

In it, she confronts a meticulous diary that she has kept for twenty-five years. &#x201c;I wanted to end each day with a record of everything that had ever happened,&#x201d; she explains. But this simple statement belies a terror that she might forget something, that she might miss something important. Maintaining that diary, now eight hundred thousand words, had become, until recently, a kind of spiritual practice.</p><p>Then Manguso became pregnant and had a child, and these two Copernican events generated an amnesia that put her into a different relationship with the need to document herself amid ongoing time.</p><p><i>Ongoingness</i> is a spare, meditative work that stands in stark contrast to the volubility of the diary&#x2015;it is a haunting account of mortality and impermanence, of how we struggle to find clarity in the chaos of time that rushes around and over and through us.</p><p>&#x201c;Bold, elegant, and honest . . . <i>Ongoingness</i> reads variously as an addict&#x2019;s testimony, a confession, a celebration, an elegy.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Paris Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Manguso captures the central challenge of memory, of attentiveness to life . . .

She lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, where she teaches at St. Mary&#x2019;s College.<p>&#x201c;[Manguso is] a Proustian minimalist on the order of Lydia Davis, both in the way she distills complex thoughts on time and memory into pure essence and in how she examines writing as a means of control. . . . While Manguso's thoughts are inward, they work outward--from her life to life itself. Read as either a meditative essay or a revealing confessional poem, this is a thoughtful, reflective look at one talented writer's creative evolution.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;This small-sized book has immense power. Marvel at the clarity and fire.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Zadie Smith</i></p><p>&#x201c;After I had my son I looked everywhere for a book that might serve as some kind of mirror. I bought so many silly books. Now I see what the problem was: I wanted a book about time--about mortality. I can't think of a writer who is at once so formally daring and so rigorously uncompromising as Sarah Manguso. <i>Ongoingness</i> is an incredibly elegant, wise book, and I loved it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Miranda July</i></p><p>&#x201c;The memoir form is shaken up and reinvented in this brilliant meditation on time and record-keeping. <i>Ongoingness</i> is a short book but there's nothing small about it.

Underwriting this book, as is true of all of Manguso's books, is writing itself. Or, rather, the writing is about itself in the best, most vital sense. Our author/narrator/speaker/heroine is never not asking the most fundamental question, namely, Why live? The seriousness of the inquiry gives this book extraordinary purpose, momentum, and value. I am in awe.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David Shields</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sarah Manguso's personal meditation on time and memory begins at the center of a dilemma: how to let time go by without losing the life it contains. <i>Ongoingness</i> is a diary turned inside out, an answer to the writer's question, 'what do I do with all the words of my life.' It's a quiet argument for letting go and going on.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lewis Hyde</i></p></p><h2>Knit Kimono Too: Simple Designs to Mix, Match, and Layer</h2><p><p>From the bestselling author of <i>Knit Kimono</i> comes a brand new collection of kimono and Asian-inspired tops with simple shapes and unique details.

So imagine her surprise when, after a fall, she comes to on the floor of a gym (a gym! she HATES the gym!) and discovers that she's actually thirty-nine, has three children, and is in the midst of an acrimonious divorce. <br><br> A knock on the head has misplaced ten years of her life, and Alice isn't sure she likes who she's become. It turns out, though, that forgetting might be the most memorable thing that has ever happened to Alice.</p><p>Liane Moriarty is the author of two novels, <i>Three Wishes</i> and <i>The Last Anniversary</i>, both of which were published around the world and translated into seven languages. She is also the author of the Nicola Berry series for children. Moriarty lives in Sydney, Australia, with her husband and two small, noisy children.<b>Chapter 1</b><p>She was floating, arms outspread, water lapping her body, breathing in a summery fragrance of salt and coconut. There was a pleasantly satisfied breakfast taste in her mouth of bacon and coffee and possibly croissants. She lifted her chin and the morning sun shone so brightly on the water, she had to squint through spangles of light to see her feet in front of her. Her toenails were each painted a different color. Red. Gold. Purple. Funny. The nail polish hadn&#x2019;t been applied very well. Blobby and messy. Someone else was floating in the water right next to her. Someone she liked a lot, who made her laugh, with toenails painted the same way. The other person waggled multicolored toes at her companionably, and she was filled with sleepy contentment. Somewhere in the distance, a man&#x2019;s voice shouted, &#x201c;Marco?&#x201d; and a chorus of children&#x2019;s voices cried back, &#x201c;Polo!&#x201d; The man called out again, &#x201c;Marco, Marco, Marco?&#x201d; and the voices answered, &#x201c;Polo, Polo, Polo!&#x201d; A child laughed; a long, gurgling giggle, like a stream of soap bubbles. A voice said quietly and insistently in her ear, &#x201c;Alice?&#x201d; and she tipped back her head and let the cool water slide silently over her face.<br>Tiny dots of light danced before her eyes.<br>Was it a dream or a memory?<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know!&#x201d; said a frightened voice. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see it happen!&#x201d;<br>No need to get your knickers in a knot.<br>The dream or memory or whatever it was dissolved and vanished like a reflection on water, and instead fragments of thought began to drift through her head, as if she were waking up from a long, deep sleep, late on a Sunday morning.<br>Is cream cheese considered a soft cheese?<br>It&#x2019;s not a hard cheese.<br>It&#x2019;s not . . .<br>. . . hard at all.<br>So, logically, you would think . . .<br>. . . something.<br>Something logical.<br>Lavender is lovely.<br>Logically lovely.<br>Must prune back the lavender!<br>I can smell lavender.<br>No, I can&#x2019;t.<br>Yes, I can.<br>That&#x2019;s when she noticed the pain in her head for the first time. It hurt on one side, a lot, as if someone had given her a good solid thwack with a baseball bat.<br>Her thoughts sharpened. What was this pain in the head all about? Nobody had warned her about pain in her head. She had a whole list of peculiar symptoms to be prepared for: heartburn, a taste like aluminum foil in your mouth, dizziness, extreme tiredness&#x2014;but nothing about a hammering ache at the side of your head. That one should really have been mentioned, because it was very painful. Of course, if she couldn&#x2019;t handle a run-of-the mill headache, well then . . .<br>The scent of lavender seemed to be coming and going, like a gentle breeze.<br>She let herself drift again.<br>The best thing would be to fall back asleep and return to that lovely dream with the water and the multicolored toenails.<br>Actually, maybe someone had mentioned headaches and she forgot? Yes, they had! Headaches, for heaven&#x2019;s sake! Really bad ones. Fabulous.<br>So much to remember. No soft cheeses or smoked salmon or sushi because of the risk of that disease she never even knew existed. Listeria. Something to do with bacteria. Hurts the baby. That&#x2019;s why you weren&#x2019;t allowed to eat leftovers. One bite of a leftover chicken drumstick could kill the baby. The brutal responsibilities of parenthood.<br>For now, she would just go back to sleep. That was the best thing.<br>Listeria.<br>Wisteria.<br>The wisteria over the side fence is going to look stunning if it ever gets around to flowering.<br>Listeria, wisteria.<br>Ha. Funny words.<br>She smiled, but her head really did hurt a lot. She was trying to be brave.<br>&#x201c;Alice? Can you hear me?&#x201d;<br>The lavender smell got stronger again. A bit sickly sweet.<br>Cream cheese is a spreadable cheese. Not too soft, not too hard, just right. Like the baby bear&#x2019;s bed.<br>&#x201c;Her eyelids are fluttering. Like she&#x2019;s dreaming.&#x201d;<br>It was no use. She couldn&#x2019;t get back to sleep, even though she felt exhausted, as if she could sleep forever. Were all pregnant women walking around with aching heads like this? Was the idea to toughen them up for labor pains? When she got up, she would check it out in one of the baby books.<br>She always forgot how pain was so upsetting. Cruel. It hurt your feelings. You just wanted it to stop, please, right now. Epidurals were the way to go. One epidural for my headache, please. Thank you.<br>&#x201c;Alice, try and open your eyes.&#x201d;<br>Was cream cheese even cheese? You didn&#x2019;t put a dollop of cream cheese on a cheese platter. Maybe cheese didn&#x2019;t actually mean cheese in the context of cream cheese. She wouldn&#x2019;t ask the doctor about it, just in case it&#x2019;s an embarrassing &#x201c;Oh, Alice&#x201d; mistake.<br>She couldn&#x2019;t get comfortable. The mattress felt like cold concrete. If she wriggled over, she could nudge Nick with her foot until he sleepily rolled over and pulled her to him in a big warm bear hug. Her human hot water bottle.<br>Where was Nick? Had he already got up? Maybe he was making her a cup of tea.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try and move, Alice. Just stay still and open your eyes, sweetie.&#x201d;<br>Elisabeth would know about the cream cheese. She&#x2019;d snort in her bigsisterly way and be precise. Mum wouldn&#x2019;t have a clue. She&#x2019;d be stricken. She&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Oh dear, oh no! I&#x2019;m sure I ate soft cheeses when I was pregnant with you girls! They didn&#x2019;t know about that sort of thing back then.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d talk on and on and worry that Alice had accidentally broken a rule. Mum believed in rules. So did Alice actually.<br>Frannie wouldn&#x2019;t know but she&#x2019;d research it, proudly, using her new computer, in the same way that she used to help Alice and Elisabeth find information for school projects in her Encyclopedia Britannica.<br>Her head really did hurt.<br>Presumably this was only the squidgiest fraction of how much labor would hurt. So that was just great.<br>It was not as if she&#x2019;d actually eaten any cream cheese that she could remember.<br>&#x201c;Alice? Alice!&#x201d;<br>She didn&#x2019;t even really like cream cheese.<br>&#x201c;Has someone called an ambulance?&#x201d;<br>There was that smell of lavender again.<br>Once, when they were undoing their seat belts, Nick said (in answer to some fishing-for-compliments thing she&#x2019;d just said), &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be ridiculous, you goose, you know I&#x2019;m bloody besotted with you.&#x201d;<br>She opened the car door and felt sunshine on her legs and smelled the lavender she&#x2019;d planted by the front door.<br>Bloody besotted.<br>It was a moment of lavender-scented bliss, after grocery shopping.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming. I called triple zero! That&#x2019;s the first time in my life I&#x2019;ve ever called triple zero! I felt all self-conscious. I nearly called 911 like an American. I actually punched in the nine. There&#x2019;s proof I watch too much television.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s not, like, serious. I mean, I couldn&#x2019;t, like, get sued or anything, could I?&#x201d;<br>Was that talkback radio she could hear? She hated talkback radio. The callers were always appalled by something. Alice said once that she&#x2019;d never been appalled by anything. Elisabeth said that was appalling.<br>&#x201c;Alice, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Alice?&#x201d;<br>Sultana, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Sultana?<br>Every night, before they went to sleep, Nick talked to the baby through an empty toilet roll pressed to Alice&#x2019;s stomach. He&#x2019;d heard this idea on some radio show. They said that way the baby would learn to recognize the father&#x2019;s voice as well as the mother&#x2019;s.<br>&#x201c;Ahoy!&#x201d; he&#x2019;d call. &#x201c;Can you hear me, Sultana? This is your father speaking!&#x201d; They&#x2019;d read that the baby was the size of a sultana by now. So that&#x2019;s what they called it. Only in private, of course; they were cool parents-to-be. No sappiness in public.<br>The Sultana said it was fine, thanks, Dad, bit bored at times, but doing okay. Apparently he wished his mum would stop eating all that boring green shit and have a pizza for a change. &#x201c;Enough with the rabbit food!&#x201d; he demanded.<br>It seemed the Sultana was most likely to be a boy. He just seemed to have a masculine personality. The little rogue. They both agreed on this.<br>Alice would lie back and look at the top of Nick&#x2019;s head. There were a few shiny silvery strands. She didn&#x2019;t know if he knew about them, so she didn&#x2019;t mention them. He was thirty-two. The silver strands made her eyes blur. All those wacky pregnancy hormones.<br>Alice never talked out loud to the baby. She spoke to it in her mind, shyly, when she was in the bath (not too hot&#x2014;so many rules). &#x201c;Hey there, Baby,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d think to herself, and then she&#x2019;d be so overwhelmed by the wonder of it she&#x2019;d splash the water with the flats of her palms like a kid thinking about Christmas. She was turning thirty soon, with a terrifying mortgage and a husband and a baby on the way, but she didn&#x2019;t feel that different from when she was fifteen.<br>Except, there were no moments of bliss after grocery shopping when she was fifteen. She hadn&#x2019;t met Nick yet. Her heart still had to be broken a few times before he could turn up and superglue it together with words like &#x201c;besotted.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Alice? Are you okay? Please open your eyes.&#x201d;<br>It was a woman&#x2019;s voice. Too loud and strident to ignore. It dragged her up into consciousness and wouldn&#x2019;t let her go.<br>It was a voice that gave Alice a familiar irritated itch of a feeling, like too-tight stockings.<br>This person did not belong in her bedroom.<br>She rolled her head to one side. &#x201c;Ow!&#x201d;<br>She opened her eyes.<br>There was a blur of unrecognizable colors and shapes. She couldn&#x2019;t even see the bedside cabinet to reach for her glasses. Her eyes must be getting worse.<br>She blinked, and blinked again, and then, like a sharpening telescope, everything came into focus. She was looking at someone&#x2019;s knees. How funny.<br>Knobbly pale knees.<br>She lifted her chin a fraction.<br>&#x201c;There you are!&#x201d;<br>It was Jane Turner of all people, from work, kneeling next to her. Her face was flushed and she had strands of sweaty hair pasted to her forehead. Her eyes looked tired. She had a soft, pudgy neck Alice had never noticed before. She was wearing a T-shirt with huge sweat marks and shorts and her arms were thin and white with dark freckles. Alice had never seen so much of Jane&#x2019;s body before. It was embarrassing. Poor old Jane.<br>&#x201c;Listeria, wisteria,&#x201d; said Alice, to be humorous.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re delirious,&#x201d; said Jane. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try and sit up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hmmph,&#x201d; said Alice. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t want to sit up.&#x201d; She had a feeling she wasn&#x2019;t in bed; she seemed to be lying flat on her back on a cool laminated floor. Was she drunk? Had she forgotten she was pregnant and got deliriously drunk?<br>Her obstetrician was an urbane man who wore a bow tie and had a round face disconcertingly similar to that of one of Alice&#x2019;s ex-boyfriends. He said he didn&#x2019;t have a problem with &#x201c;say, an aperitif followed by one glass of wine with dinner.&#x201d; Alice thought an aperitif must be a particular brand of drink. (&#x201c;Oh, Alice,&#x201d; said Elisabeth.) Nick explained that an aperitif was a predinner drink. Nick came from an aperitif-drinking family. Alice came from a family with one dusty bottle of Baileys sitting hopefully in the back of the pantry behind the tins of spaghetti. In spite of what the obstetrician said, she&#x2019;d only had a half a glass of champagne since she&#x2019;d done the pregnancy test and she felt guilty about that even though everybody kept saying it was fine.<br>&#x201c;Where am I?&#x201d; asked Alice, terrified of the answer. Was she in some seedy nightclub? How could she explain to Nick that she forgot she was pregnant?<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re at the gym,&#x201d; said Jane. &#x201c;You fell and knocked yourself out. Gave me an absolute heart attack, although I was sort of grateful for the excuse to stop.&#x201d;<br>The gym? Alice didn&#x2019;t go to gyms. Had she woken up drunk in a gym?<br>&#x201c;You lost your balance,&#x201d; said a sharp, jolly voice. &#x201c;It was quite a fall! Gave us all a shock, you silly sausage! We&#x2019;ve called an ambulance, so don&#x2019;t you worry, we&#x2019;ve got professional help on the way!&#x201d;<br>Kneeling next to Jane was a thin, coffee-tanned girl with a bleachedblond ponytail, shiny Lycra shorts, and a cropped red top with the words SPIN CRAZY emblazoned across it. Alice felt instant dislike for her. She didn&#x2019;t like being called a silly sausage. It offended her dignity. One of Alice&#x2019;s faults, according to her sister Elisabeth, was a tendency to take herself too seriously.<br>&#x201c;Did I faint?&#x201d; asked Alice hopefully. Pregnant women fainted. She had never fainted in her life, although she spent most of fourth grade practicing, in the hope that she could be one of those lucky girls who fainted during church and had to be carried out, draped across the muscly arms of their PE teacher, Mr. Gillespie.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that I&#x2019;m pregnant,&#x201d; she said. Let her see who she was calling a silly sausage.<br>Jane&#x2019;s mouth dropped. &#x201c;Jesus, Alice, you are not!&#x201d;<br>Spin Crazy Girl pursed her mouth as if she&#x2019;d caught Alice out being naughty. &#x201c;Oh dear, sweetie, I did ask at the beginning of the class if anyone was pregnant. I would have put you up front near the fan. You shouldn&#x2019;t have been so shy.&#x201d;<br>Alice&#x2019;s head thumped. Nothing anybody said was making sense.<br>&#x201c;Pregnant,&#x201d; said Jane. &#x201c;At this time. What a disaster.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It is not!&#x201d; Alice put a protective hand to her stomach, so the Sultana wouldn&#x2019;t hear and be offended. Their financial situation was none of Jane&#x2019;s business. People were meant to be delighted when you announced a pregnancy.<br>&#x201c;I mean, what are you going to do?&#x201d; asked Jane.<br>For heaven&#x2019;s sake! &#x201c;Do? What do you mean, what am I going to do? I&#x2019;m going to have a baby.&#x201d; She sniffed. &#x201c;You smell of lavender. I knew I could smell lavender.&#x201d; Her sense of smell had been extra strong because of the pregnancy.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my deodorant.&#x201d; Jane really didn&#x2019;t look like herself. Her eyes didn&#x2019;t look right. It was quite noticeable. Maybe she needed to start using some sort of eye cream.<br>&#x201c;Are you all right, Jane?&#x201d;<br>Jane snorted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. Worry about yourself, woman. You&#x2019;re the pregnant one knocking yourself out.&#x201d;<br>The baby! She&#x2019;d been selfishly thinking about her sore head when she should have been worrying about the poor little Sultana. What sort of a mother was she going to be?<br>She said, &#x201c;I hope I didn&#x2019;t hurt the baby when I fell.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, babies are pretty tough, I wouldn&#x2019;t worry about that.&#x201d;<br>It was another woman&#x2019;s voice. For the first time Alice looked up and realized a crowd of red-faced, middle-aged women in sports gear surrounded her. Some of them were leaning forward, staring at her with avid road-accident interest, while others had their hands on their hips and were chatting to one another as if they were at a party. They seemed to be in a small, fluorescentlit room. She could hear tinny music somewhere in the distance, clanking metal sounds, and a sudden burst of loud masculine laughter. As she lifted her head, she saw that the room was filled with stationary bikes, all crammed together and facing the same direction.<br>&#x201c;Although, you shouldn&#x2019;t really be doing exercise that gets your heart rate up too high if you&#x2019;re pregnant,&#x201d; said another woman.<br>&#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t do any exercise,&#x201d; said Alice. &#x201c;I should do more exercise.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You, my girl, couldn&#x2019;t do any more exercise if you tried,&#x201d; said Jane.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201d; She looked around at the strange faces surrounding her. This was all so . . . silly. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know where I am.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s probably got a concussion,&#x201d; said somebody excitedly. &#x201c;Concussed people are dazed and disoriented.&#x201d;<br>Spin Crazy Girl looked frightened and stroked Alice&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Oh dear, sweetie, YOU MIGHT BE JUST A LITTLE BIT CONCUSSED,&#x201d; she yelled.<br>&#x201c;Ye...</p></p><h2>Beth Russell&#39;s William Morris Needlepoint</h2><p>Popular British needlework designer Beth Russsell presents--for the first time--20 needlepoint designs based on the original works of William Morris.

Today, at the age of thirty, he is probably the most famous adventure athlete in the world. In that short time, he has proven his expertise in many styles of climbing and has shattered speed records, pioneered routes, and won awards within each discipline. More spectacularly still, he has pushed the most extreme and dangerous form of climbing far beyond the limits of what anyone thought was possible.</p><p>Free soloing, Honnold&#x2019;s specialty, is a type of climbing performed without a rope, a partner, or hardware&#x2015;such as pitons, nuts, or cams&#x2015;for aid or protection. The results of climbing this way are breathtaking, but the stakes are ultimate: if you fall, you die.</p><p>In <em>Alone on the Wall</em>, Honnold recounts the seven most astonishing climbing achievements so far in his meteoric and still-evolving career. He narrates the drama of each climb, along with reflective passages that illuminate the inner workings of his highly perceptive and discerning mind. We share in the jitters and excitements he feels waking in his van (where he lives full time) before a climb; we see him self-criticize in his climbing journal (a veritable bible for students of the sport); and we learn his secrets to managing fear&#x2015;his most enviable talent. Veteran climber and award-winning author David Roberts writes part of each chapter in his own voice, and he calls on other climbers and the sport&#x2019;s storied past to put Alex's tremendous accomplishments in perspective.</p><p>Whenever Honnold speaks in public, he is asked the same two questions: "Aren't you afraid you're going to die?" and "Why do you do this?" <em>Alone on the Wall</em> takes us around the world and through the highs and lows in the life of a climbing superstar to answer those fascinating questions. Honnold's extraordinary life, and his idiosyncratic worldview, have much to teach us about risk, reward, and the ability to maintain a singular focus, even in the face of extreme danger.</p> 16 pages of color photographs</p><p><p><strong>Alex Honnold</strong>&nbsp;is a world-class American rock climber best known for his free solo ascents of big walls.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong> is the award-winning author of twenty-nine books about mountaineering, exploration, and anthropology, including <em>Alone on the Wall</em> which was written with world-class rock climber Alex Honnold, whose historic feats were featured in the film <em>Free Solo</em>.</p>&#x201c;Honnold is the biggest name in a group of adventure athletes engaging in high-risk live action-sports spectacles that seem to be pulled from the Evel Knievel playbook.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Grayson Schaffer, <em>Outside</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Honnold has free-soloed the longest, most challenging climbs ever.

A year later, he&#39;d completed a solo course from Athens to Marathon, and now, after dozens of such races, not to mention triathlons and a slew of critically acclaimed books, he reflects upon the influence the sport has had on his life and on his writing. Equal parts travelogue, training log, and reminiscence, this revealing memoir covers his four-month preparation for the 2005 New York City Marathon and settings ranging from Tokyo&#39;s Jingu Gaien gardens, where he once shared the course with an Olympian, to the Charles River in Boston among young women who outpace him.Through this marvellous lens of sport emerges a cornucopia of memories and insights: the eureka moment when he decided to become a writer, his greatest triumphs and disappointments, his passion for vintage LPs, and the experience, after fifty, of seeing his race times improve and then fall back. By turns funny and sobering, playful and philosophical, &#34;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&#34; is rich and revealing, both for fans of this masterful yet private writer and for the exploding population of athletes who find similar satisfaction in distance running.</p><p>Haruki Murakami was born in Kyoto in 1949 and now lives near Tokyo. His work has been translated into forty-two languages. The most recent of his many honors is the Franz Kafka Prize.AUGUST 5, 2005 . KAUAI, HAWAII<br><br>Who's Going to Laugh at Mick Jagger?<br><br>I'm on Kauai, in Hawaii, today, Friday, August 5, 2005. It's unbelievably clear and sunny, not a cloud in the sky. As if the concept <i>clouds </i>doesn't even exist. I came here at the end of July and, as always, we rented a condo. During the mornings, when it's cool, I sit at my desk, writing all sorts of things. Like now: I'm writing this, a piece on running that I can pretty much compose as I wish. It's summer, so naturally it's hot. Hawaii's been called the island of eternal summer, but since it's in the Northern Hemisphere there are, arguably, four seasons of a sort. Summer is somewhat hotter than winter. I spend a lot of time in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and compared to Cambridge--so muggy and hot with all its bricks and concrete it's like a form of torture--summer in Hawaii is a veritable paradise. No need for an air conditioner here--just leave the window open, and a refreshing breeze blows in. People in Cambridge are always surprised when they hear I'm spending August in Hawaii. "Why would you want to spend summer in a hot place like that?" they invariably ask. But they don't know what it's like. How the constant trade winds from the northeast make summers cool. How happy life is here, where we can enjoy lounging around, reading a book in the shade of trees, or, if the notion strikes us, go down, just as we are, for a dip in the inlet.<br><br>Since I arrived in Hawaii I've run about an hour every day, six days a week. It's two and a half months now since I resumed my old lifestyle in which, unless it's totally unavoidable, I run every single day. Today I ran for an hour and ten minutes, listening on my Walkman to two albums by the Lovin' Spoonful--<i>Daydream</i> and <i>Hums of the Lovin' Spoonful</i>--which I'd recorded on an MD disc.<br><br>Right now I'm aiming at increasing the distance I run, so speed is less of an issue. As long as I can run a certain distance, that's all I care about. Sometimes I run fast when I feel like it, but if I increase the pace I shorten the amount of time I run, the point being to let the exhilaration I feel at the end of each run carry over to the next day. This is the same sort of tack I find necessary when writing a novel. I stop every day right at the point where I feel I can write more. Do that, and the next day's work goes surprisingly smoothly. I think Ernest Hemingway did something like that. To keep on going, you have to keep up the rhythm. This is the important thing for long-term projects. Once you set the pace, the rest will follow. The problem is getting the flywheel to spin at a set speed--and to get to that point takes as much concentration and effort as you can manage.<br><br>It rained for a short time while I was running, but it was a cooling rain that felt good. A thick cloud blew in from the ocean right over me, and a gentle rain fell for a while, but then, as if it had remembered, "Oh, I've got to do some errands!," it whisked itself away without so much as a glance back. And then the merciless sun was back, scorching the ground. It's a very easy-to-understand weather pattern. Nothing abstruse or ambivalent about it, not a speck of the metaphor or the symbolic. On the way I passed a few other joggers, about an equal number of men and women. The energetic ones were zipping down the road, slicing through the air like they had robbers at their heels. Others, overweight, huffed and puffed, their eyes half closed, their shoulders slumped like this was the last thing in the world they wanted to be doing. They looked like maybe a week ago their doctors had told them they have diabetes and warned them they had to start exercising. I'm somewhere in the middle.<br><br>I love listening to the Lovin' Spoonful. Their music is sort of laid-back and never pretentious. Listening to this soothing music brings back a lot of memories of the 1960s. Nothing really special, though. If they were to make a movie about my life (just the thought of which scares me), these would be the scenes they'd leave on the cutting-room floor. "We can leave this episode out," the editor would explain. "It's not bad, but it's sort of ordinary and doesn't amount to much." Those kinds of memories--unpretentious, commonplace. But for me, they're all meaningful and valuable. As each of these memories flits across my mind, I'm sure I unconsciously smile, or give a slight frown. Commonplace they might be, but the accumulation of these memories has led to one result: me. Me here and now, on the north shore of Kauai. Sometimes when I think of life, I feel like a piece of driftwood washed up on shore.<br><br>As I run, the trade winds blowing in from the direction of the lighthouse rustle the leaves of the eucalyptus over my head.<br><br>I began living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the end of May of this year, and running has once again been the mainstay of my daily routine ever since. I'm seriously running now. By <i>seriously</i> I mean thirty-six miles a week. In other words, six miles a day, six days a week. It would be better if I ran seven days, but I have to factor in rainy days, and days when work keeps me too busy. There are some days, too, when frankly I just feel too tired to run. Taking all this into account, I leave one day a week as a day off. So, at thirty-six miles per week, I cover 156 miles every month, which for me is my standard for <i>serious </i>running.<br><br>In June I followed this plan exactly, running 156 miles on the nose. In July I increased the distance and covered 186 miles. I averaged six miles every day, without taking a single day off. I don't mean I covered precisely six miles every day. If I ran nine miles one day, the next day I'd do only three. (At a jogging pace I generally can cover six miles in an hour.) For me this is most definitely running at a serious level. And since I came to Hawaii I've kept up this pace. It had been far too long since I'd been able to run these distances and keep up this kind of fixed schedule.<br><br>There are several reasons why, at a certain point in my life, I stopped running seriously. First of all, my life has been getting busier, and free time is increasingly at a premium. When I was younger it wasn't as if I had as much free time as I wanted, but at least I didn't have as many miscellaneous chores as I do now. I don't know why, but the older you get, the busier you become. Another reason is that I've gotten more interested in triathlons, rather than marathons. Triathlons, of course, involve swimming and cycling in addition to running. The running part isn't a problem for me, but in order to master the other two legs of the event I had to devote a great deal of time to training in swimming and biking. I had to start over from scratch with swimming, relearning the correct form, learning the right biking techniques, and training the necessary muscles. All of this took time and effort, and as a result I had less time to devote to running.<br><br>Probably the main reason, though, was that at a certain point I'd simply grown tired of it. I started running in the fall of 1982 and have been running since then for nearly twenty-three years. Over this period I've jogged almost every day, run in at least one marathon every year--twenty-three up till now--and participated in more long-distance races all around the world than I care to count. Long-distance running suits my personality, though, and of all the habits I've acquired over my lifetime I'd have to say this one has been the most helpful, the most meaningful. Running without a break for more than two decades has also made me stronger, both physically and emotionally.<br><br>The thing is, I'm not much for team sports. That's just the way I am. Whenever I play soccer or baseball--actually, since becoming an adult this is almost never--I never feel comfortable. Maybe it's because I don't have any brothers, but I could never get into the kind of games you play with others. I'm also not very good at-one-on-one sports like tennis. I enjoy squash, but generally when it comes to a game against someone, the competitive aspect makes me uncomfortable. And when it comes to martial arts, too, you can count me out.<br><br>Don't misunderstand me--I'm not totally uncompetitive. It's just that for some reason I never cared all that much whether I beat others or lost to them. This sentiment remained pretty much unchanged after I grew up. It doesn't matter what field you're talking about--beating somebody else just doesn't do it for me. I'm much more interested in whether I reach the goals that I set for myself, so in this sense long-distance running is the perfect fit for a mindset like mine.<br><br>Marathon runners will understand what I mean. We don't really care whether we beat any other particular runner. World-class runners, of course, want to outdo their closest rivals, but for your average, everyday runner, individual rivalry isn't a major issue. I'm sure there are garden-variety runners whose desire to beat a particular rival spurs them on to train harder. But what happens if their rival, for whatever reason, drops out of the competition? Their motivation for running would disappear or at least diminish, and it'd be hard for them to remain runners for long.<br><br>Most ordinary runners are motivated by an individual goal, more than anything: namely, a time they want to beat. As long as he can beat that time, a runner will feel he's accomplished what he set out to do, and if he can't, then he'll feel he hasn't. Even if he doesn't break the time he'd hoped for, as long as he has the sense of satisfaction at having done his very best--and, possibly, having made some significant discovery about himself in the process--then that in itself is an accomplishment, a positive feeling he can carry over to the next race.<br><br>The same can be said about my profession. In the novelist's profession, as far as I'm concerned, there's no such thing as winning or losing. Maybe numbers of copies sold, awards won, and critics' praise serve as outward standards for accomplishment in literature, but none of them really matt...</p><h2>Collected Novellas: Collected Early Fiction 1949-1964 (German and Austrian Literature)</h2><p>The early fiction of one of the most daring and influential writers of postwar Germany, a man often called the German James Joyce due to the linguistic inventiveness of his fiction.</p><p>John E. Woods won both the 1981 American Book Award and PEN award for his translation of Schmidt&#39;s Evening Edged in Gold and has published a new translation of Thomas Mann&#39;s Buddenbrooks.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Diana: Her True Story</h2><p>Physical description: viii,165p., [48]p. of plates : ports.(some col.) ; 24 cm. Notes: Includes index. Subjects: Diana Princess of Wales 1961-1997. Princesses - Great Britain - Biography.</p><p><i>Diana: Her True Story</i> was originally published in 1992 under the guise of a quasi-authorized biography, with mostly unnamed courtiers and royalty as the accredited sources. It instantly became a sizzling, international bestseller that lanced the boil of Windsor family dysfunction, triggering a chain of events that led to Charles and Diana's divorce. After her tragic death in 1997, Andrew Morton revealed that Diana herself had not only been the main source for the book, but had also edited his original drafts for accuracy. In return for this gold mine of information, Diana wanted complete anonymity for fear of retaliation from the queen. <i>Her True Story in Her Own Words</i> is enhanced by more than 75 full-color photographs of the princess, from her childhood in Althorp to her marriage to Charles at Westminster Abbey to her humanitarian efforts, and finally to her unforgettable funeral service. However, the most poignant portrayal of the princess emerges from the unedited transcriptions of Diana's interviews with Morton: "I think I'm going to cut a very different path from everyone else. I'm going to break away from this setup and go and help the man on the street."<p>The sudden and tragic death of Princess Diana has caused the entire world to reflect on how much this singular woman meant to us all. From her fairy-tale courtship, her wedding to Prince Charles, and the birth of her two wonderful boys to the stunning collapse of her marriage and the revelation of her psychological and physical trauma, we witnessed and shared in the wide range of emotions in her life. In the last few years, Diana's dedication to the downtrodden and unloved and her commitment as a mother have only strengthened her hold on our hearts. </p><p>When <i>Diana: Her True Story</i> was initially published in 1992, it was met with a hail of abuse from the British Establishment. As time passed, however, the magnitude of Diana's marital and personal distress made it clear, even to the greatest doubters, that this book was indeed Diana's true story; and finally, in 1995, she revealed in a BBC interview that she had indirectly cooperated with Andrew Morton. </p><p>What has not been known, however, until the publication of this new edition, is that <i>Diana: Her True Story</i> was in fact almost entirely based on her own words, supplemented by interviews with her friends. In 1991 and 1992, when this book was first conceived and written, Diana felt trapped and powerless within the royal family. She knew that the truth about her life was submerged under a mountain of royal propaganda. <i>Diana: Her True Story</i> chronicles Diana's unhappiness, which began shortly before her wedding day, and reveals the life of a young and beautiful woman who, trapped in a loveless marriage, had sunk to the depths of despair; from which recovery seemed impossible. In an act of desperation, she made the decision in 1991 to tell her own story, no matter what the cost. And so she and Andrew Morton began a collaboration that was to shake the royal family to its foundations and, eventually, force Diana to seek a new life. Tragically, that new, and briefly happy, life is over. </p><p>This new edition contains the story of how the book first came into being. What's more, Diana is able, finally, to tell her own story, in her own words. Its pages contain her own testament -- the closest we will ever come to her autobiography.</p></p><h2>A Book of Pagan Prayer</h2><p>It is you who will be talking to the gods. Be clear. Be careful in how you pray. Take care how you come before the gods. Give them your best. There are many reference books on elaborate pagan rituals but never - until now - a guide to the most basic of practices: prayers and offerings. A Book of Pagan Prayer provides the pagan community a comprehensive and thoughtful selection of prayers - and shows readers how they too can create their own. After an introduction on why to pray, author Ceisiwr Serith explores how to pray through words, posture, dance, and music. He explains how to prepare for and compose prayers, how to address and honor the deities, and how to conclude a prayer. Serith also answers important questions, such as: Why should pagans pray? Should prayers be spontaneous? What are offerings about? Is all this just trying to buy the gods off? Gathered from many traditions - including Celtic, Germanic, Egyptian, Greek, and Zoroastrian - this guide includes nearly 500 sample prayers organized by purpose: for the family and household; times of the day, month, and year; life passages; thanksgiving, grace, and petition; as well as litanies and mantras. Whether offering a blessing, celebrating new life, safeguarding travel, or honoring the seasons, readers will discover timeless pagan prayers for worship, spiritual connection, and personal relationship with the gods.</p><p>In his 25 years as a Pagan, Ceisiwr Serith has been active in the Pagan community both as a writer and a presenter of workshops at Pagan gatherings. His interest in prayers and offerings grew naturally as the result of writing rituals for Wiccan covens, Druidic groves, and, of course, his book The Pagan Family. He has written several articles on Proto-Indo-European theology and Celtic and Druidic traditions for Enchante, The Druid&#39;s Progress, and Oak Leaves. Serith is a member of Arn Draiocht Fein, the nation&#39;s largest Druid fellowship, and a founding member of one of its groves.Pagan Prayers and MoreBilling itself as the one and only collection of prayers for Pagans of any tradition, Ceisiwr Serith's A Book of Pagan Prayer includes prayers to Celtic, Egyptian, Zoroastrian and other deities. It is organized thematically, making it convenient to use if one is seeking prayers for specific occasions, seasons, times of day, meals or milestones. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>It&#39;s A God Thing: When Miracles Happen to Everyday People</h2><p><p><b>Some things in life have no earthly explanation.</b></p><p>Miracles are not reserved for the characters in the Old and New Testaments; they happen to everyday people.</p><p>Series creators Don Jacobson and K-LOVE Radio have joined together to produce one of the most remarkable collections of modern-day miracles ever compiled.

As we learn in <i>Parallax,</i> his success comes from his sculptural form making, his interest in the poetics of space, color, and materiality, and his fascination with scientific phenomena. Holl reveals his working methods in this, his biggest and most ambitious book yet on his work-part treatise, part manifesto, and part, as Holl writes, "liner notes" to fifteen recent projects, some never before published. <p><i>Parallax</i> traces Holl's ideas on topics as diverse as the "chemistry of matter" and the "pressure of light," and shows how they emerge in his architectural work: "strange attractors" at Cranbrook, "porosity" in his new dormitory at MIT, "tripleness" in the new Bellevue Art Museum in Washington. The result is a book that provides a personal tour of the work of one of the world's most esteemed architects. </p><p><i>Parallax</i> is designed by Michael Rock of the award-winning design firm 2x4. It is our fourth book on Holl's work, following <i>Anchoring, Intertwining,</i> and <i>The Chapel of St. Ignatius.</i></p></p><p>Steven Holl is probably a pretty cool architect. With its clean, racy curves both inside and out, his recent Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art (and biggest project to date) in Helsinki looks like an artfully cut-out chunk of a late '50s sports car, or better yet--given its minty-blue tones and <i>au courant</i> materials--a huge iMac. His very intimate Chapel of St. Ignatius in Seattle (about which he published a previous book, <i>The Chapel of St. Ignatius</i>; he's also put out <i>Anchoring</i> and <i>Intertwining</i>), with its exterior reflecting pool and beguiling interior play of light, curves, and color couldn't be more iconoclastic for a Catholic house of worship, yet it exudes a queer grace in the same spirit as Le Corbusier's famous Chapel at Ronchamp. And surely the banks of Boston's Charles River have never seen anything like the dormitory complex Noll has designed for MIT--the model of which, included here, promises a multicube city unto itself with an intricate, discontinuous fa�ade of overlapping grids and screens, so radical in concept that it defies written description (or a really good one, at any rate).<p> And yet the reason why the very chicly designed <i>Parallax</i> (with a list price of $40, it's probably the world's most expensive cardboard-covered book) only <i>probably</i> affirms that Holl is a cool architect is that there are simply not enough full-color photographs of his completed work here to tell. Holl is a very conceptual architect, and most of the pages here contain what he refers to as his "liner notes" on his projects--leaden, humorless meditations on such themes as "chemistry of matter," "pressure of light," "strange attractors," and "porosity" as they relate to his work. Beyond that, there's a profusion of computer renderings, simple sketches, and tiny black-and-white photographs of small portions that, alas, also do very little to illuminate his work for the reader.</p><p> What little color photography is offered here is excellent, going a long way even in its paucity toward suggesting why Holl has already created a stir (and you can click on our unique <i>Look inside this book!</i> link below the cover image to get a sense of it). Just one limited shot of even a modest project like his 1996 Ikebana House in Makuhari, Japan, seizes the eye with its almost astonishing manipulation of color, texture, and curvature, leaving the beholder hungry for more. If you're already familiar with Holl's work and <i>really</i> curious about his scientific-minded musings on them, you'll appreciate <i>Parallax</i>. Otherwise, keep your fingers crossed that in the next book of his work, Holl shows more and tells less. <i>--Timothy Murphy</i></p></p><h2>Iron Orchid (Holly Barker Novels)</h2><p>Discovering that ex-CIA tech wizard and political assassin Teddy Fay is still alive, agent Holly Barker joins an elite task force assigned to track him and becomes suspicious in the wake of a series of insider tricks, a case that escalates into a high-speed chase throughout New York City.

Her father, Senior Master Sergeant, U.S. Army (ret.), Hamilton Barker, looked through his hand scope.</p><p>&#x201c;High and to the right,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;How high and how far to the right of what?&#x201d; Holly asked in disbelief.</p><p>&#x201c;An inch high and to the right of dead center,&#x201d; Ham replied. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not good enough. Push with your right hand, pull with your left.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve been doing since I was eight, when you first taught it to me,&#x201d; Holly said. She took aim and, this time, made a point of pushing and pulling.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s better,&#x201d; Ham said.</p><p>&#x201c;How much better?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A quarter of an inch off dead center,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, please,&#x201d; Holly said, laughing.</p><p>&#x201c;How did the Orchid Beach town council take your resignation as chief of police?&#x201d; Ham asked.</p><p>&#x201c;They were appropriately sad, except for a couple who looked relieved. At least they accepted my recommendation of Hurd Wallace to replace me. They&#x2019;re getting a good man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re losing a better woman. What are you going to do with your house?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One of my young policewomen is going to move into the guesthouse and be my caretaker. I&#x2019;ll need the house to decompress once in a while. Also to remind me of Jackson.&#x201d; Jackson Oxenhandler, Holly&#x2019;s fianc�, had been killed in a bank robbery two years before, an innocent bystander.</p><p>Ham went to his range bag and came back with a mahogany box.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Something for you to take with you on the new job.&#x201d; He handed her the box and a small key.</p><p>Holly set down the box, inserted the key and unlocked it. &#x201c;Oooh,&#x201d; she said, gazing at the shiny stainless slide with her name engraved on it. &#x201c;Nice Colt .45.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a Colt, and it&#x2019;s not a .45,&#x201d; Ham said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a nine-millimeter made of Caspian parts. The lightweight frame was designed by Terry Tussey, and the grip holds a round shorter than standard, but it will conceal nicely. Only weighs twenty-one ounces. I thought it might come in handy.&#x201d;</p><p>Holly picked up the small gun and hefted it. &#x201c;Nice,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Ham handed her a loaded magazine. &#x201c;See if you can hit anything with it.&#x201d;</p><p>The target was still set at twenty-five feet. Holly set herself, pushed and pulled and squeezed off the round.</p><p>&#x201c;Half an inch off dead center,&#x201d; Ham said. &#x201c;Not bad, considering it&#x2019;s a three-inch barrel, instead of four.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sweet trigger,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;Four, four and a half pounds?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Four, exactly. Try it with both eyes open, and use up the magazine, rapid fire.&#x201d;</p><p>Holly obliged.</p><p>&#x201c;That target no longer has a center,&#x201d; Ham said, a touch of pride in his voice. He went back to his range bag and came back with some gun leather. &#x201c;Mitch Rosen made you a shoulder rig, a belt and a holster for it,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s beautiful work,&#x201d; she said, caressing the mahogany leather. &#x201c;Thank you, Ham.&#x201d; She put her arms around him and hugged.</p><p>Ham, uncharacteristically, hugged her back, but then he looked a little embarrassed. &#x201c;What time did you file for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ten,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;My stuff&#x2019;s in the car.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to clear out at Fort Pierce for the Bahamas,&#x201d; Ham said.</p><p>&#x201c;I know, Ham.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why you want to go to the Bahamas alone for a weekend,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;I just want to take Daisy and spend the weekend alone; I have a lot to think about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever you say.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back on Monday, maybe Sunday night, depending on the weather.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>She packed up her things, put her new gun into her range bag and went to the car. She gave Ham a wave and drove off.</p><p>AT FOUR O&#x2019;CLOCK that afternoon, Holly landed the rented Cessna at Roberts International Airport in Grand Cayman, having flown first to the Bahamas, checked into a hotel, filed a new flight plan and left Daisy in a prearranged kennel. She dropped off her bag with the doorman at her Georgetown hotel, then kept the cab for the trip to the bank. Refusing the driver&#x2019;s help, she hefted the two nylon duffels from the trunk of the cab and carried them inside.</p><p>A Mr. Dellinger&#x2014;English, well-tailored and very discreet looking&#x2014;was waiting for her. He nodded for a guard to take the bags, and the man went into a side room while Dellinger showed her into his office.</p><p>&#x201c;How do you do?&#x201d; Dellinger said, offering his hand.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m very pleased to meet you,&#x201d; Holly replied.</p><p>&#x201c;The money will be machine counted in there,&#x201d; Dellinger said. &#x201c;It will take a little while; why don&#x2019;t we get the paperwork done?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right.&#x201d; She sat down at his desk.</p><p>He handed her a sheet of paper. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a very simple form,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You may use any name you like, and you needn&#x2019;t put down an address, since we will not be mailing you account statements.&#x201d;</p><p>Holly put down &#x201c;H. Barker&#x201d; for a name. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like two credit cards in the same name,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They may be used by two different people, and I brought a sample signature of the other person.&#x201d; She gave him a photocopy of Ham&#x2019;s signature. It was illegible to anyone but her. She signed &#x201c;H. Barker&#x201d; for her own card.</p><p>The guard came back and handed Dellinger a slip of paper.</p><p>&#x201c;Five million, seven hundred and sixty thousand dollars,&#x201d; Dellinger said. &#x201c;Does that sound right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It sounds exactly right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me tell you a few things about our service,&#x201d; Dellinger said, &#x201c;and I hope you won&#x2019;t take offense at what may seem to be our assumptions. We give all our clients this information without regard to the amount deposited or the source of the funds.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be offended,&#x201d; Holly said.</p><p>&#x201c;First of all, because of the way we disperse cash around the world, these funds will immediately become untraceable. In the unlikely event that the United States or any other country should invade our island and take over our bank, they will not find a name on your account, only a number, which will not be in any way traceable to you. The number will not be coded in any way that would reveal even the nationality of the customer.</p><p>&#x201c;The only thing traceable to you would be the credit card charges. When you view your credit card statement, you&#x2019;ll be given the option of erasing the names of the payees&#x2014;hotels, restaurants or shops, for instance. Only the amounts and dates of the charges would then appear on your statement, which you may access by entering your account number and a password, which you will designate. You may use as many as three passwords, each from four to twelve letters or digits or a combination of both.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That sounds good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is very important that you never forget the passwords, because if you do, you will not be able to access your account statements. In order to change the passwords, you would have to come personally here, to the bank.&#x201d;</p><p>Holly signed one card and put them both into her pocket.</p><p>&#x201c;The paper I gave you also has instructions for going to your account online,&#x201d; Dellinger said. &#x201c;Will there be anything else?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I think that does it,&#x201d; Holly said. She shook his hand and left the bank. Now the drug money she had stolen from the hundreds of millions confiscated in a huge raid was safe from anyone but her, and no one would ever be able to prove that she had it. At least, she hoped not.</p><p>She spent the night in Georgetown, then, the following morning, flew back to the Bahamas. She spent two days there, shopping, eating and walking on the beach with Daisy, and on Monday morning she flew home to Orchid Beach.</p></p><h2>Square Foot Gardening High-Value Veggies: Homegrown Produce Ranked by Value (Volume 6) (All New Square Foot Gardening, 6)</h2><p><p>Get the most return on investment from your garden by calculating which vegetables, fruits, and herbs give the highest payback.

Parker wondered if at some point every person reached an age where he or she prayed for a pause to progress, although often it seemed to him that progress was just so much window dressing, because people tended to remain much as they had always been. Still, he wished folks would occasionally leave the windows as they were, for a while at least.<br> <br>The presence of the bar was indicated solely by a sign on the sidewalk, required because the establishment was set back from the street on the first floor of an old warehouse, and would otherwise have been difficult, if not impossible, to find.<br> <br>Perhaps this was why it appealed to Louis. Given the opportunity, Louis might even have dispensed with the sign entirely, and supplied details of the bar&#x2019;s location only to those whose company he was prepared to tolerate, which meant that maybe five people in the world would have been burdened with the responsibility of keeping it in business.<br> <br>No such tactics were required on this night to offer Louis the peace he desired. Only a handful of customers were present: a young couple at a corner table, two older men eating burgers at the bar, and Parker and Louis. Parker had just been served a glass of wine. Louis was drinking a martini, very dry. It might not have been his first, but with Louis it was always difficult to tell.<br> <br>&#x201c;How is he?&#x201d; Parker asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Confused. In pain.&#x201d;<br> <br>Days earlier, Louis&#x2019;s partner, Angel, had been relieved of a tumor the size of an egg in a New York hospital, along with a length of his large intestine. The procedure hadn&#x2019;t gone entirely well, and the recuperation period would be difficult, involving chemotherapy sessions every three weeks for the next two years, while the threat of ancillary growths remained. The call to inform Parker of Louis&#x2019;s presence in the city of Portland had therefore come as a surprise. Parker had intended to travel down to New York to visit Angel and offer Louis whatever support he could. Instead, Louis was sitting in a Portland bar while his partner lay in a hospital bed, medicated up to his eyeballs.<br> <br>But then, Louis and Angel were unique unto themselves: criminals, lovers, killers of men, and crusaders for a cause that had no name beyond Parker&#x2019;s own. They kept to their particular rhythm as they walked through life.<br> <br>&#x201c;And how are you?&#x201d; asked Parker.<br> <br>&#x201c;Angry,&#x201d; said Louis. &#x201c;Concerned and frightened, but mostly angry.&#x201d;<br> <br>Parker said nothing, but sipped his wine and listened to a ship calling in the night.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t expect to be back here so soon,&#x201d; Louis continued, as though in answer to Parker&#x2019;s unvoiced question, &#x201c;but there were some things I needed from the condo. And anyway, the New York apartment just didn&#x2019;t feel right without Angel next to me. It was like the walls were closing in. How can that be? How can a place seem smaller when there&#x2019;s one person missing from it? Portland&#x2019;s different. It&#x2019;s less his place. So I visited with him this afternoon, then took a car straight to LaGuardia. I wanted to escape.&#x201d;<br> <br>He sipped his cocktail.<br> <br>&#x201c;And I can&#x2019;t go to the hospital every day. I hate seeing him that way.&#x201d; He turned to look at Parker. &#x201c;So talk to me about something else.&#x201d;<br> <br>Parker examined the world through the filter of his wineglass.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Fulcis are considering buying a bar,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Paulie and Tony Fulci were Portland&#x2019;s answer to Tweedledum and Tweedledee, assuming Tweedledum and Tweedledee were heavily&#x2014;if unsuccessfully&#x2014;medicated for psychosis, built like armored trucks, and prone to outbreaks of targeted violence that were often, but not always, the result of severe provocation, the Fulcis&#x2019; definition of which was fluid, and ranged from rudeness and poor parking to assault and attempted murder.<br> <br>Louis almost spat out his drink.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re fucking kidding. They haven&#x2019;t told me anything about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe they were afraid you might choke&#x2014;and not without justification.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But a bar is a business. With patrons. You know, regular human beings.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;re banned from almost every drinking hole in this city, with the exception of the Bear, and that&#x2019;s only because Dave Evans doesn&#x2019;t want to hurt their feelings. Also, they help keep bad elements at bay, although Dave sometimes struggles to imagine an element worse than the Fulcis themselves. But Paulie says that they&#x2019;re worried about falling into a rut, and they have some money from an old bequest that they&#x2019;re thinking of investing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A bequest? What kind of bequest?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably the kind made at gunpoint. Seems they&#x2019;ve been sitting on it for years.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just letting it cool down a little, huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cool down a lot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They planning on fronting this place themselves, or would they actually like to attract a clientele?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re looking for a stooge.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll need to find someone crazier than they are.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I believe that&#x2019;s proving an obstacle to progress.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Would you front a bar run by the Fulcis?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;At least it would be guaranteed free of trouble.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it would be guaranteed free of outside trouble.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If they manage to open, you&#x2019;ll be obliged to support them. They&#x2019;ll be very unhappy otherwise. You know how fond they are of you and Angel.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which is your fault.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I simply facilitated an introduction.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like rats facilitated the introduction of the plague.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tut-tut.&#x201d;<br> <br>Louis finished his drink and raised his glass for another.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;that news has cheered me up some.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought it might.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You working on anything?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just some paper for Moxie. Routine stuff.&#x201d;<br> <br>Moxie Castin was one of Portland&#x2019;s more colorful legal figures. With his ill-fitting suits and huckster manner, Moxie appeared completely untrustworthy, but in Parker&#x2019;s experience only trustworthy individuals were prepared to embrace a livery that suggested the opposite. Moxie paid well and on time, which made him a rara avis not only in legal circles but in most other circles as well. Finally, Moxie was privy to most&#x2014;although not all&#x2014;of Parker&#x2019;s affairs, including the discreet arrangement whereby the Federal Bureau of Investigation paid a retainer into Parker&#x2019;s account each month in return for consultancy services. It was not a state of affairs of which Moxie unconditionally approved, although at least Parker also recognized it for the devil&#x2019;s bargain it was.<br> <br>&#x201c;You look tired for a man dealing with routine stuff,&#x201d; said Louis.<br> <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t been sleeping well.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bad dreams?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I can always tell the difference between dreams and reality. Waking sometimes seems as bad as sleeping.&#x201d;<br> <br>Parker was already recognizing signs of the onset of a depression that had shadowed him even in adolescence, but had begun to trouble him more deeply since the gun attack that almost killed him. He knew that soon he would have to seek seclusion. He would want&#x2014;even need&#x2014;to be alone, because it was at those times that his dead daughter most often appeared to him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Angel said something to me once.&#x201d;<br> <br>Parker waited, and it was as though Louis had heard his thoughts, or had glimpsed the flickering whiteness of a lost child in Parker&#x2019;s eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;He said he thought you saw Jennifer, that she spoke to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jennifer&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;With respect, that&#x2019;s not the point.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like I said, I find it hard to tell what are dreams and what are not.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, I don&#x2019;t think you find it hard at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>Slow time passed before Louis spoke again.<br> <br>&#x201c;I used to dream of my father.&#x201d;<br> <br>Parker knew that Louis&#x2019;s father had fallen into the hands of bigoted, violent men who hanged him from a tree before setting him alight. Many years later Louis returned for those responsible, and burned the tree on which his father had died.<br> <br>&#x201c;He would come to me in my sleep,&#x201d; said Louis, &#x201c;wreathed in fire, and his mouth would move as he tried to speak, except nothing ever came out, or nothing I could understand. I used to wonder what he was trying to say. In the end, I figured he was warning me. I think he was telling me not to go looking for vengeance, because he knew what I&#x2019;d become if I did.<br> <br>&#x201c;So I dreamed him, and I knew I was dreaming him, but when I woke I&#x2019;d smell him in the room, all shit and gasoline, all smoke and charred meat. I&#x2019;d tell myself I was imagining it, that these were all smells I knew from before, and the force of the dream was just tricking my mind into putting them together. But it was strong, so strong: it would be in my hair and on my skin for the rest of the day, and sometimes other folks picked up on it too. They&#x2019;d comment, and I wouldn&#x2019;t have an answer for them, or none they&#x2019;d want to hear, and maybe none I&#x2019;d want to hear either.<br> <br>&#x201c;It would frighten me. Frightened me for most of my life. Angel knew, but no one else. He smelled it on me, smelled it after my nightmares when I woke up sweating beside him in bed, and I didn&#x2019;t want to lie to him, because I&#x2019;ve never lied to him. So I told him, just like I&#x2019;m telling you, and he believed me, just like I know you believe me.<br> <br>&#x201c;My father doesn&#x2019;t come to me so much anymore, but when he does I&#x2019;m no longer troubled. You know why? Because of you. Because I&#x2019;ve seen things with you, experienced things that made me understand I wasn&#x2019;t crazy, and I wasn&#x2019;t alone. More than that, there&#x2019;s a consolation to it, to all of this. I think that&#x2019;s why I came up here tonight, and why I called you. If I lose Angel, I know I&#x2019;ll find him again. I&#x2019;ll tear this world apart before I do, and maybe I&#x2019;ll die burning like my father burned, but that won&#x2019;t be the end for Angel and me. He&#x2019;ll wait for me on the other side, and we&#x2019;ll go together into whatever waits. This I know because of you. I&#x2019;ve hurt a lot of people, some that didn&#x2019;t deserve what came to them and some that did, although the distinction meant nothing to me then, and doesn&#x2019;t mean a whole lot now. I could have questioned what I did, but I chose not to. I have blood on my hands, and I&#x2019;ll shed more before I&#x2019;m done with this life, but I&#x2019;ll shed it because I&#x2019;m following a different path, your path, and I&#x2019;ll sacrifice myself because I have to, because it&#x2019;s my reparation. In return, I&#x2019;ll be allowed to stay with Angel forever. That&#x2019;s the deal. You tell that to your daughter next time you see her. You tell her to bring it to her god.&#x201d;<br> <br>Parker stared hard at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just how many cocktails have you had?&#x201d;<br> <br>The stillness seemed to encompass the entire bar.

No one thinks he's perfect. He has made mistakes-- big ones. And he is finally ready to admit them.</p><p>Pete Rose's <i>My Prison Without Bars</i> is written for a purpose: to make Pete Rose's case for the Hall of Fame. On paper, Rose's credentials seem unassailable. The all-time career hits leader, Rose owns seven Major League and twelve National League records from his 24 years in baseball.<p> The controversy comes down to Major League Baseball's Rule 21: "Any... employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible." In 1989 Rose was suspended from baseball after allegations that he gambled on the sport, allegations Rose denied. Thereafter, fans and sportswriters have speculated that baseball officials would re-instate Rose if only he admitted his guilt. In the book, Rose confesses--for the first time--that he did in fact bet on Reds games while he managed the team, though he claims that he never bet <i>against</i> the Reds. This would seem to be the "coming clean" that baseball was looking for.</p><p> Rose, however, doesn't seem ready to give up his fight. The book attacks John Dowd and Commissioner Bart Giamatti for the 1989 report which ultimately led to Rose's suspension. Rose picks apart the report showing that the evidence was either falsified or from unreliable sources. Yet, he admits that the document's conclusion--that he bet on baseball--was accurate. Rose declares guilt but still seems to believe, as he says, that gambling is a "victimless crime" and that his punishment does not fit the crime. He won't "act sorry or sad or guilty" because he is "just not built that way."</p><p> Admirers of Rose the athelete will likely be disappointed by the book. After a too-short recollection of his life in baseball, Rose dwells heavily on the gamblers, bookmakers, runners, and memorabilia dealers who made up his world when he could no longer compete as a player. In the end, <i>My Prison Without Bars</i> is an interesting historical document in one of the greatest baseball scandals of all time, but those looking for a record of Rose's amazing baseball achievements are better off consulting <i>The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract</i>. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><p><b><i>Pete Rose</i></b><br><i>My Prison Without Bars</i></p><p>PETE ROSE HOLDS MORE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL RECORDS THAN ANY OTHER PLAYER IN HISTORY.

And pays well.</p><p>Sal, Max and Enzo Bruschetti have proved this over a lifetime of nefarious activity that they have kept hidden from law enforcement. Nowhere in any file, on any computer is there a record of anything illegal from which they have profited. But Max has a problem. His body is getting old and his doctor has told him to take it easy. Max has decided that the time has come for the family to retire.</p><p>But when young actor Harry Murphy overhears the Bruschetti brothers planning changes to their organization, including the murder of a man in London who knows too much, the Bruschetti's plans begin to unravel. </p><p>After Harry makes the well-intentioned if egregious mistake of trying to warn the Bruchetti's intended victim he finds himself alone in a foreign country, on the wrong side of the law, with a suitcase full of cash and a dangerous man on his trail. And while his good looks, charm and cheerful persistence may prove assets in the turbulent events that follow, none of Harry's past roles have prepared him for what happens next.</p><p>At turns tense and funny, <i>Once a Crooked Man</i> is infused with the infectious charm that has made David McCallum one of television's longest running, most-beloved stars.</p></p><p>David McCallum is a Scottish-born actor and musician.

McCallum respects the genres' tenets, supplying the right amount of intrigue, violence and sex for a well-plotted, action-packed tale. While occasional bits of humor add levity to the plot, McCallum keeps a near hard-boiled edge to the story.

But her roommates are acting strangely, her boyfriend&#39;s strict schedule is becoming a nuisance, and the world in general seems increasingly out of her control. In great despair, Agnes decides to make it her business to set things straight.</p><p><p><b>Rachel Cusk</b> is also the author of <i>The Country Life</i>. She lives in Oxford.</p>After the critical success of The Country Life, Cusk's American audience should relish the opportunity to read her Whitbread Prize-winning debut novel, first published in Britain in 1993. Here, too, a na?ve young woman is the heroine of a compelling and eloquent tale about her devastating first love affair, and her emergence, newly independent, into the adult world. Agnes Day lives in London with her friends Nina and Merlin, buddies since Oxford, and works at a magazine called Diplomat's Week. Agnes hates her name, and the ordinariness of her life. Longing for love, she thinks she has found her opportunity in John, a handsome, somewhat mysterious man whose suave nonchalance is matched by his subtle perversity. As in The Country Life, Cusk reveals bits and pieces of the affair through Agnes's memories, a device that allows her to show how scenes from their relationship come back to haunt Agnes after the breakup. Hidden to the reader, as it was to Agnes, is a crucial secret about John that her friends kept from her. Cusk writes witty and winding sentences that are a joy to read, once one gets past the first chapters of the novel, where they are frustratingly unrelieved by plot. However, as the complications of the storyAthe affair, the dramas at the magazine, the roommate problemsAassume clear focus, the narrative becomes engrossing. Quirky but appealing characters and wry social commentary enliven the narrative, and Cusk's use of telling detail is exquisite and sometimes diabolical. The dialogue is often hilarious, illuminating even minor characters with pithy ?lan. Readers will find themselves plugging for the hapless but increasingly feisty AgnesAand savoring Cusk's rich explorations into the life of a young woman whose view of the world is never rosy, but who, in the book's closing scenes, comes to understand that future happiness can lurk in an event as ordinary as a bus ride. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gravitation, Vol. 1</h2><p>Determined to become a rock star, Shuichi Shindou is discouraged by some harsh criticism he receives, and must find the strength to overcome his fears and keep trying.</p><p>A romantic comedy/drama about making it in the music industry.

Odessa is not known to be a town big on dreams, but the Panthers help keep the hopes and dreams of this small, dusty town going. Socially and racially divided, its fragile economy follows the treacherous boom-bust path of the oil business.In bad times, the unemployment rate barrels out of control; in good times, its murder rate skyrockets. But every Friday night from September to December, when the Permian High School Panthers play football, this West Texas town becomes a place where dreams can come true.

Indeed, as this breathtaking examination of the town, the team, its coaches, and its young players chronicles, the team, for better and for worse, <i>is</i> the town; the communal health and self-image of the latter is directly linked to the on-field success of the former. The 1988 season, the one <i>Friday Night Lights</i> recounts, was not one of the Panthers' best. The game's effect on the community--and the players--was explosive. Written with great style and passion, <i>Friday Night Lights</i> offers an American snapshot in deep focus; the picture is not always pretty, but the image is hard to forget.<b>H.G.

Since the millennium, commentators of every variety have been trying to get a handle on the collective significance of the continuous crises besetting us in modern times: banking crises, terrorist crises, sovereign debt crises, climate change crises, energy crises, food crises, ecological crises, man-made and otherwise.<br> <br>&#x201c;The world as we know it is going down,&#x201d; a Wall Street broker told reporters in September 2008, after Lehman Brothers collapsed and Morgan Stanley threatened to follow suit. It is the &#x201c;end of capitalism as we know it,&#x201d; declared the filmmaker Michael Moore when the American auto giant General Motors filed for bankruptcy. It is the end of our dependence on fossil fuel, announced President Barack Obama, about the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion. It is the end of nature, wrote Bill McKibben in his book of the same name. It is the end of oil, wrote the journalist Paul Roberts in his book of the same name. It is the end of food because it is the end of oil, declared Roberts in his follow-up book. For those who take stock in the Mayan Long Count calendar and the apocalyptic significance of 2012, it is the beginning of the end of the world.<br> <br>But the crises we face on many fronts are symptomatic of a deeper problem, with more potential repercussions than those of any single cataclysmic event. They are simply a measure of the vast disparity between our definition of ourselves and our truest essence. For hundreds of years we have acted against nature by ignoring our essential connectedness and defining ourselves as separate from our world. We&#x2019;ve reached the point where we can no longer live according to this false view of who we really are. What&#x2019;s ending is the story we&#x2019;ve been told up until now about who we are and how we&#x2019;re supposed to live&#x2014;and in this ending lies the only path to a better future.<br> <br>In this book, I have an audacious mission: to revolutionize the way you live your life. This book is going to rewrite the scientific story you&#x2019;ve been told about who you are, because the current version has reduced us to our lowest common denominator. At this very moment you live contrary to your truest nature. I hope to help you to recapture your birthright, which has been sabotaged not only by modern society but, more fundamentally, by modern science. I wish to wake you up to who you really are, to do nothing less than to return to you your authentic self.<br> <br>The leitmotif of our present story is the hero up against it all. We take it for granted that our life&#x2019;s journey is meant to be a struggle. Consequently we remain constantly vigilant, poised to wrestle with every behemoth&#x2014;at home, at work, among our acquaintances and friends&#x2014;that strays across our path. No matter how pleasant our lives, the vast majority of us maintain a stance of operating contra mundi, with every encounter some sort of battle to be fought: against the coworkers who seek to usurp our jobs or promotions, or the students who raise the bell curve against which we are judged; against the people who take our subway seat, the shops that overcharge us, the neighbors who have a Mercedes when we drive a Volvo, and even the husband or wife who has the temerity to insist on maintaining an opinion that is different from ours.<br> <br>This idea that we operate against the world has its origin in our basic understanding that this self of ours, the thing we call I, exists as a separate entity, a unique creation of genetic code that lives apart from everything else out there.<br> <br>The most enduring statement we make about the human condition, the central fact of our existence, is our solitude, our sense of separation from the world. We regard as self-evident that we exist as self-contained, isolated beings, living out our individual dramas, while everything else&#x2014;other atoms and other cells, other living things, the land masses, the planets, even the air we breathe&#x2014;exists as something distinct and wholly separate.<br> <br>Although we begin life from the uniting of two entities, from there on in, science tells us, we are essentially on our own. The world is the irrefutable other, carrying on impassively with or without us. Our hearts, we believe, beat finally and painfully alone.<br> <br>This paradigm of competitive individualism offers us a view of life as a heroic struggle for dominion over hostile elements and a share of strictly limited resources. There&#x2019;s not enough out there, and others may be fitter than we, so we have to do our damnedest to get hold of it first.<br> <br>A multitude of influences&#x2014;religious, political, economic, scientific, and philosophical&#x2014;writes the story that we live by. Nevertheless most of the big ideas we have about the universe and what it is to be human derive from three revolutions: the Scientific Revolution, or the Age of Enlightenment, and the two Industrial Revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, which transformed the cultural and socioeconomic conditions of the West into our modern developed world. These movements largely created the modern sense of our own individuality by drastically altering our vision of the universe from a harmonious, benevolent, and interconnected whole to an amalgam of separate and unrelated things, competing with each other for survival.<br> <br>The Scientific Revolution launched a relentless march toward atomization, as scientists believed they could understand the whole of the universe by studying its individual components.<br> <br>With the publication of the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687, Isaac Newton, the father of modern physics, described a universe in which all matter was thought to move according to certain fixed laws within three-dimensional time and geometrical space. Newton&#x2019;s laws of motion and gravity depict the universe essentially as machine, a vast clockwork of separate parts that can always be relied upon to follow predictable behavior. Once Newtonian laws demonstrated that the trajectory of virtually everything, from single objects to the motion of the planets, could be reduced to a mathematical equation, the world came to be viewed as dependably mechanistic. Newtonian laws also demonstrated that things exist independently from each other, complete in themselves, with their own inviolate boundaries. We ended with the hairs on our skin, at which point the rest of the universe began.<br> <br>The French philosopher Ren� Descartes wrote of man&#x2019;s essential separation from his universe in a philosophy that banished any kind of holistic intelligence from nature and portrayed matter as mechanistic and corpuscular. Even our material bodies lay outside of our conscious selves: one more well-oiled and highly dependable machine.<br> <br>The Newtonian paradigm of world-as-machine was further reinforced with the arrival of the most influential machine of all: the steam engine. Steam and the development of machine tools not only transformed the production of food, fuel, heating, manufacturing, and transport; they also profoundly affected human beings by separating them from the natural world. In every way life was broken down into regular sequences. Work was now dictated by an assembly line, and workers became one more cog in the wheel of production. Time was parceled out in minutes, and not through the seasons of planting and harvest, and marked through the punching in of a clock. The vast majority of people working in factories no longer followed the rhythms of nature, but the rhythms of the machine.<br> <br>The Second Industrial Revolution, in the nineteenth century, introduced modern technology with the advent of steel and petroleum manufacturing and led to the rise of a middle class, which in turn paved the way for modern capitalism and the promotion of the individual and his interests. In An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, published in 1776 and considered one of the founding philosophies of economic theory, Scottish philosopher Adam Smith argued that the &#x201c;invisible hand&#x201d; of the market, created by natural supply and demand, and competition between self-interested individuals would naturally best serve society as a whole. He famously believed that we do best for others by giving way to this fundamentally selfish nature of ours and looking out for Number One: &#x201c;By pursuing his own interest, [the individual] frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he intends to promote it.&#x201d;iintronote1<br> <br>Undoubtedly the scientific discovery with the most pervasive hand in our current worldview is Charles Darwin&#x2019;s theory of evolution through natural selection. When assembling his ideas for On the Origin of Species, the young Darwin was profoundly influenced by the concerns of the Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus on population explosion and limited natural resources.iintronote2 Darwin concluded that, since there wasn&#x2019;t enough to go around, life must evolve through what he termed a &#x201c;struggle for existence.&#x201d; &#x201c;As more individuals are produced than can possibly survive,&#x201d; Darwin wrote in Origin, &#x201c;there must in every case be a struggle for existence, either one individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life.&#x201d;iintronote3<br> <br>Darwin was at pains to note that his catch phrase &#x201c;struggle for existence&#x201d; was not literal but highly elastic, encompassing everything from the search of tree roots for water to the reliance of a pack of animals on each other. It was actually the British philosopher Herbert Spencer who first coined the term &#x201c;survival of the fittest,&#x201d; after an enthusiastic reading of On the Origin of Species; after some persuasion Darwin accepted the term,iintronote4 eventually adding the subtitle: Or The Preservation of the Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.<br> <br>Malthus had provided Darwin with a central metaphor to explain the mechanism behind nature&#x2019;s drive to propagate and thrive, and as an inadvertent consequence, Darwin unleashed upon the world a metaphor that came to represent the human experience: life as war. An individual or population thrives only at another one&#x2019;s expense. Despite Darwin&#x2019;s liberal use of the term, almost immediately the narrower meaning of the metaphor stuck, offering a scientific framework for all the various burgeoning social and economic movements of the day. Most subsequent interpretations of Darwin&#x2019;s work, even in his lifetime, promoted a vision of all aspects of life as a battle over scarce resources, in which only the toughest and most single-minded survived.<br> <br>The English biologist Thomas Huxley, the Richard Dawkins of his day, dubbed &#x201c;Darwin&#x2019;s bulldog&#x201d; for his role as Darwin&#x2019;s vociferous mouthpiece, generously extended the view of dog-eat-dog competition in his belief that it was responsible for the evolution of culture, ideas, and even the human mind. Huxley was convinced that it was in the natural order for human beings to put their own interests above all others.iintronote5<br> <br>Thanks to newly invented telegraphic cables and advances in printmaking, the wider interpretation of Darwin&#x2019;s theory quickly swept across the globe. &#x201c;Survival of the fittest&#x201d; made for a perfect fit with Smith&#x2019;s brand of enlightened competition in the marketplace, but besides Western capitalism, the theory of natural selection was also used to justify the Chinese revolution and the &#x201c;whitening&#x201d; of Latin American indigenous culture with European stock.iintronote6 Writers such as the Russian-born Ayn Rand used fiction as thinly disguised polemic to applaud the process whereby each of us attempts to gulp the biggest breath of a strictly limited amount of oxygen.<br> <br>The metaphoric representation of life as a race to the finish line has been used as intellectual justification for most aspects of modern industrialized society, which regards competition as society&#x2019;s perfect shakedown mechanism, separating out the economically, politically, and socially weak from the strong. The winners have a right to winner take all because the human race as a whole would benefit from it.<br> <br>The final important influence on our modern scientific definition of ourselves occurred in 1953, when the molecular biologists James Watson and Francis Crick claimed to have unlocked the &#x201c;secret of life&#x201d; by unraveling deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the genetic coding in the nucleus of every cell. Thereafter many scientists came to believe that within the coiled double helix lay every individual&#x2019;s lifelong blueprint. Each of our cells, equipped with a full pack of genes, would live out its preprogrammed future, while we were held hostage by our genetic destiny, powerless to do anything other than observe the drama unfolding. As with every other kind of matter, the human being had also been atomized&#x2014;reduced, in a sense, to a mathematical equation.<br> <br>Modern-day interpreters of Darwin, the neo-Darwinists, have woven competition and struggle into the latest theories of our biological makeup by proposing that every part of us acts selfishly in order to survive; our genes&#x2014;even our ideas&#x2014;are engaged in competition with other gene pools and thoughts for domination and longevity.iintronote7 Indeed some scientists invest genes with the power to control every aspect of our lives, considering the body an accidental byproduct of a greater evolutionary endeavor.iintronote8<br> <br>Modern evolutionary theory has removed any vestigial sense of moral design or beneficence from the natural world: nature has no stake in cooperation or partnership, but only likes winners, of any sort. The vision of a purposeful and harmonious whole has been replaced with blind evolutionary force, in which human beings no longer play a conscious part.<br> <br>Many psychologists argue that competitiveness is hardwired within us, a natural biological urge as inherent as our basic urge to survive. After we stop fighting over food, water, shelter, and mates, the theory goes, we begin competing over more ephemeral prizes: power, status, and, most recently, fame.<br> <br>Consequently for more than three hundred years our worldview has been shaped by a story that describes isolated beings competing for survival on a lonely planet in an indifferent universe. Life as defined by modern science is essentially predatory, self-serving, and solitary.<br> <br>These metaphors&#x2014;the mechanistic view of the universe, the &#x201c;red in tooth and claw&#x201d; sense of ourselves&#x2014;have seeped into our consciousness to permeate our every day. Our paradigm for living today has been built upon the premise that competition is the essential calling card of existence. Every modern recipe in our lives has been drawn from our interpretation of life as individual and solitary struggle, with every-man-for-himself competition an inherent part of the business of living. Our entire Western economic model is built on the notion that competition in a free-market economy is essential to drive excellence and prosperity. In our relationships we extol our inherent right to individual happiness and self-expression above all else. We educate our young by encouraging them to compete and excel over their peers. The currency of most modern two-cars-in-every-garage neighborhoods is comparison and one-upmanship. The world, as Woody Allen once put it, &#x201c;is one big cafeteria.&#x201d;<br> <br>The individualistic, winner-take-all zeitgeist of modern times is to blame for many of the crises we presently face in our society, particularly the excesses of the financial sector, with its insistence on a bigger and better profit every year, at any cost. Before being jailed for his part in the energy company Enron&#x2019;s vast array of fraudulent activities, CEO Jeffrey Skilling bragged that his favorite book was neo-Darwinist Richard Dawkins&#x2019;s The Selfish Gene, and he periodically fired the entirety of t...</p><h2>Skeleton God: An Inspector Shan Tao Yun Mystery (Inspector Shan Tao Yun, 9)</h2><p><p>In Eliot Pattison's <i>Skeleton God</i>, Shan Tao Yun, now the reluctant constable of a remote Tibetan town, has learned to expect the impossible at the roof of the world, but nothing has prepared him for his discovery when he investigates a report that a nun has been savagely assaulted by ghosts.

In no time Terence is plunged into the exciting world of kings, wizards, knights, wars, magic spells, dwarfs, damsels in distress, and enchanters. As he adjusts to his new life, he proves to be not only an able squire but also a keen observer of the absurdities around him.

The next day, while hes serving lunch at another race, the glass-fronted box of the grandstand explodes. Max turns sleuth to save his reputation and his restaurant.

A man in whom I believed had nothing but greed in his heart, yet I couldn&#39;t see the truth. He is in prison now, for theft and defrauding another unsuspecting person.&#39; Unbidden tears welled in Elsie&#39;s eyes, and she cried out. &#39;Oh, Mrs. Murray, how can I ever trust my feelings again? How can I ever know the difference between love that is true and what is false?&#39; Elsie&#39;s experiences with a cunning charlatan have led her to doubt herself, and not even two years in the royal courts and stately homes of Europe have completely healed her wounded heart. But Elsie is now twenty-one and about to return to her homeland. Will she abandon all her dreams of finding true love? Can anyone overcome her memories of the treacherous Bromly Edgerton? Will she recognize the face of true love? In this fifth book of the Elsie Dinsmore: A Life of Faith series, readers will follow the charming heroine on a crucial, life-changing journey. Along the way, she will return to the place of her birth, meet old friends and new, and encounter difficulties and dangers that challenge her strong sense of right and wrong. Adapted from the 19th century novels by Martha Finley, Elsie&#39;s True Love is a story sure to thrill everyone who believes in the power of love.</p><p>Elsie Dinsmore is now a young woman who has passed her twenty-first birthday, or her "majority." As an adult, she is responsible for the large inheritance left to her by her mother, yet the privileges of wealth are of little importance to Elsie. Like most young women of her day, she is concerned about her future and the prospect of finding a husband and life partner. She knows that the man she marries must share her abiding Christian faith and be of fine character and loving disposition. But she has been deeply hurt by a deceitful suitor who loved only her wealth. As this new novel begins, she is understandably mistrustful of her ability to recognize real love when it comes her way. <p>In this book, the fifth in the Elsie Dinsmore: A Life of Faith series adapted from the original 19th century volumes written by Martha Finley, readers will join the resilient heroine as she embarks on one of life's most important journeys--the search for Elsie's True Love. It is a journey with unexpected complications and offers lessons that transcend time. </p><p>Though Elsie is a 19th century woman, her struggles and her hopes are not so different from those of girls and young women of the 21st century. Marriage may be uppermost in Elsie's mind, but she has other issues to contend with--changes in her relationships with her parents, other family members, and friends now that she is an adult herself; the proper management of the large estate and many business interests that make up the bulk of her inheritance; and dealing on a personal level with the pressing social and moral dilemmas of her era. At times, she is uncertain of her judgment and her ability to cope with her new independence. </p><p>But whatever befalls her, Elsie knows that her greatest help and comfort lies in the love of her Heavenly Father and Beloved Savior, Jesus Christ. This is the message of Christian faith and love which Martha Finley sent out in her wonderful Elsie novels to the young people of the 19th century. It is our pleasure, at Mission City Press, to carry Miss Finley's message forward today, though these newly adapted and updated versions of the story of Elsie Dinsmore's life of faith. </p><p>Other books in the series carried by amazon.com:<br> Book One - Elsie's Endless Wait ISBN 1928749011<br> Book Two - Elsie's Impossible Choice ISBN 192874902X<br> Book Three - Elsie's New Life ISBN 1928749038<br> Book Four - Elsie's Stolen Heart ISBN 1928749046<br> Book Six - Elsie's Troubled Times ISBN 1928749062<br> Elsie's Christmas Party ISBN 1928749526</p>Mission City Press is a Christian publishing company dedicated to teaching kids to live a life of faith with passionate devotion to Jesus Christ.</p><h2>George Whitefield: God&#39;s Anointed Servant in the Great Revival of the Eighteenth Century</h2><p><p>God's accomplishments through George Whitefield are to this day virtually unparalleled. Even during his lifetime Whitefield was considered "the most brilliant and popular preacher the modern world has ever known." In the wake of his fearless preaching, revival swept across the British Isles, and the Great Awakening transformed the American colonies.</p> <p>When Whitefield died at age 55, he had preached 30,000 sermons. His hearers included not only the poor and the uneducated, but prominent English aristocrats and American statesmen such as David Hume and Benjamin Franklin.</p> <p>Christians today continue to take courage from Whitefield's humility and deep spirituality. A founder of Methodism, he yielded his leadership to John Wesley rather than risk splitting the movement, thus revealing his fervent commitment to the gospel of Christ rather than to personal plans or hopes.</p> <p>The previous two-volume work, receiving critical praise and popular acceptance, is here condensed into one magnificent volume.

Every pro-free-market move we made helped turn the Vietnamese people against us.&nbsp;In Iraq, we were stunningly dismissive of the hatred between that country&#x2019;s Sunnis and Shias.&nbsp; If we want to get our foreign policy right &#x2013; so as to not be perpetually caught off guard and fighting unwinnable wars &#x2013; the United States has to come to grips with political tribalism abroad.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just as Washington&#x2019;s foreign policy establishment has been blind to the power of tribal politics outside the country, so too have American political elites been oblivious to the group identities that matter most to ordinary Americans &#x2013; and that are tearing the United States apart.&nbsp; As the stunning rise of Donald Trump laid bare, identity politics have seized both the American left and right in an especially dangerous, racially inflected way.&nbsp; In America today, every group feels threatened: whites and blacks, Latinos and Asians, men and women, liberals and conservatives, and so on. There is a pervasive sense of collective persecution and discrimination. &nbsp;On the left, this has given rise to increasingly radical and exclusionary rhetoric of privilege and cultural appropriation. On the right, it has fueled a disturbing rise in xenophobia and white nationalism. <br> &nbsp;<br> In characteristically persuasive style, Amy Chua argues that America must rediscover a national identity that transcends our political tribes.&nbsp; Enough false slogans of unity, which are just another form of divisiveness. It is time for a more difficult unity that acknowledges the reality of group differences and fights the deep inequities that divide us.</p><p><b>Amy Chua</b> is the John M. Duff, Jr. Professor at Yale Law School. She is a noted expert in the fields of ethnic conflict and globalization, and the author of the bestselling titles <i>World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability</i>, <i>Day of Empire: How Hyperpowers Rise to Global Dominance -- and Why They Fall</i>, <i>Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</i>, and her most recent book, <i>The Triple Package: How Three Unlikely Traits Explain the Rise and Fall of Cultural Groups in America</i>, co-written with Jed Rubenfeld. She lives in New Haven, Connecticut, with her husband and two daughters.&nbsp;&#x201c;An&nbsp;important book ...[I]&nbsp;strongly agree with Chua&#x2019;s argument that America&#x2019;s liberal elite has contributed to Trump&#x2019;s rise by failing to acknowledge its own sense of tribalism." &#x2014; <b><i>Financial Times</i></b> <br><br>&#x201c;True to form, Amy Chua presents a provocative prescription to cure our political ills. She challenges us to cross the chasm between groups&#x2014;not by denying differences, but by celebrating them.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Adam Grant, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Give and Take</i>, <i>Originals</i>, and <i>Option B</i> with Sheryl Sandberg</b><br><br>&#x201c;Presented with keen clarity and brimming with definitive insights, Chua&#x2019;s analysis of identity politics is essential reading for understanding policy challenges both at home and abroad.&#x201d; &#x2014; <b><i>Booklist&nbsp;</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Amy Chua&#x2019;s insightful, provocative and deeply troubling book is the place to begin our long overdue national discussion on how to repair the deep divisions in the American political landscape. <i>Political Tribes</i> is a wakeup call to the dangers of surrendering national unity to a fractured landscape of feuding and narrow interests.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Tom Brokaw, author of <i>The Greatest Generation</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Brilliant, timeless and timely. <i>Political Tribes</i> concisely explains the forces that made our experiences in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq so maddeningly difficult to comprehend, and brings that same thoughtful analysis to America today.&nbsp; Amy Chua provokes thought &#x2013; and we need that.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;General Stan McChrystal, US Army (Ret)</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Political Tribes</i> is a beautifully written, eminently readable, and uniquely important challenge to conventional wisdom. In it, Amy Chua argues that tribalism&#x2014;and the social dysfunction and violence that comes along with it&#x2014;is the norm all over the world, but the United States managed to escape its worst impulses thanks to a shared sense of national identity. But there's trouble on the horizon: identity politics on both the left and right threaten to unravel that consensus. Chua's book is a clarion call, encouraging us to reject the primal pull of identitarianism and return to that most radical of ideas, that Americans share something bigger than race or ethnicity or ideology: common citizenship and purpose.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;J. D. Vance, author of <i>Hillbilly Elegy</i></b><br> &nbsp; <br> &#x201c;Another wonderful book by Amy Chua! In <i>Political Tribes</i>, she demonstrates once again that she ranks with the keenest observers of the contemporary landscape, establishing convincingly that &#x201c;Humans are tribal,&#x201d; and that this reality holds significant implications for America if we truly are to achieve a &#x2018;more perfect union.&#x2019;&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;General David Petraeus, US Army (Ret), former commander of coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and former Director of the CIA<br><br></b>&#x201c;Amy Chua speaks hard truths that no one can ignore. We are, as Chua makes clear, living in denial about the power of tribalism over our domestic and foreign policy -- blinded, it seems, by our own optimism and distaste for essentialism. A page turner and revelation, <i>Political Tribes</i> will change the way you think.&#x201d;<b><br> <b>&#x2014;Tim Wu, author of <i>The</i> <i>Attention Merchants</i> and <i>The Master Switch</i></b><br></b></p><h2>Time Team&#39;S&#39; Timechester : A Companion to Archaeology</h2><p>The presenters of &#34;Time Team&#34;, Channel 4&#39;s archaeology series, describe the development of Timechester, an imaginary British settlement, showing the changes in an archetypal townscape from prehistory to the modern age.

To inspire a quiet revolution in the whole way we look at death and care for the dying and the whole way we look at life, and care for the living&#39; Written by Buddhist meditation master and popular international speaker Soygal Rinpoche, this highly acclaimed book clarifies the majestic vision of life and death that underlies the Tibetan tradition. It includes not only a lucid, inspiring and complete introduction to the practice of meditation but also advice on how to care for the dying with love and compassion, and how to bring them help of a spiritual kind. But there is much more besides in this classic work, which was written to inspire all who read it to begin the journey to enlightenment and so become &#39;servants of peace&#39; working in the world.</p><p>In 1927, Walter Evans-Wentz published his translation of an obscure Tibetan Nyingma text and called it the <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>. Popular Tibetan teacher Sogyal Rinpoche has transformed that ancient text, conveying a perennial philosophy that is at once religious, scientific, and practical. Through extraordinary anecdotes and stories from religious traditions East and West, Rinpoche introduces the reader to the fundamentals of Tibetan Buddhism, moving gradually to the topics of death and dying. Death turns out to be less of a crisis and more of an opportunity. Concepts such as reincarnation, karma, and bardo and practices such as meditation, tonglen, and phowa teach us how to face death constructively. As a result, life becomes much richer. Like Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, Sogyal Rinpoche opens the door to a full experience of death. It is up to the reader to walk through. <i>--Brian Bruya</i><p>"What is it I hope for from this book? To inspire a quiet revolution in the whole way we look at health and care for the dying, and the whole way we look at life and care for the living."</p><p>This acclaimed spiritual masterpiece is widely regarded as one of the most complete and authoritative presen-tations of the Tibetan Buddhist teachings ever written. A manual for life and death and a magnificent source of sacred inspiration from the heart of the Tibetan tradition, <em>The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying</em> provides a lucid and inspiring intro-duction to the practice of meditation, to the nature of mind, to karma and rebirth, to compassionate love and care for the dying, and to the trials and rewards of the spiritual path.</p><p>Buddhist meditation master and international teacher Sogyal Rinpoche brings together the ancient wisdom of Tibet with modern research on death and dying and the nature of the universe. With unprecedented scope, <em>The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying</em> clarifies the majestic vision of life and death that underlies the classic sacred text <em>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</em>. Sogyal Rinpoche presents simple yet powerful practices from the heart of the Tibetan tradition that anyone, whatever their religion or background, can do to transform their lives, prepare for death, and help the dying.</p></p><h2>A Divided Spy: A Novel (Thomas Kell, 3)</h2><p><p><b>In <i>A Divided Spy</i>, a brilliant novel of modern espionage by <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Charles Cumming, MI6&#x2019;s </b><b>Thomas Kell faces off against a handsome and charismatic Russian double agent.</b></p><p>"Astonishingly masterful . . . riveting." <b>&#x2015;Valerie Plame, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Fair Game</i></b></p><p>Thomas Kell thought he was done with spying.

He thought not. In his experience, recruits did not care about such things. The hands drove home their final nails with resoundingwhacks and turned to face their captain, touching their foreheads with all fingers. Automatically, Noen replaced his helmet and returned their salutes. "Good work. Now we'll rejoin Lieutenant Dinnile and see if these have brought anyone yet." Recklessly he added, "I'll buy you each a tankard, if there's a good hand already." The sailors grinned and took their positions like proper bodyguards, the woman ahead of him and the man behind him. Noen tried to recall their names; they pulled the first (that was, the rearmost) starboard oar--Syb and Su, of course. Each wore a sharply curved cutlass in a canvas sheath now, although the hammers they carried would be nearly as effective. He himself was far better armed, with his sword and double-barreled pistol. Not that swords or "villainous saltpetre" should be needed for the drunken sailors of Rat Alley, or its cutthroats either--Naval officers were notoriously savage fighters and just as notoriously broke. If they were attacked, it might even be possible to carry the fellow--undamaged, Noen hoped--aboard <i>Windsong.</i> There he would sign on or chase a sack of ballast to the bottom. "Why, if we were attacked by fifty or so ..." "Sir?" Su looked over her shoulder at him. "Talking to myself," Noen told her brusquely. "Stupid habit." There were always the judges. A judge could pardon an offender willing to enlist. And judges <i>did</i> pardon such offenders--for well-connected captains, and for captains who could offer rich gifts in return. Not for Tev Noen, to be sure. A rat scampered across Noen's boots, and he kicked it. It sailed past Su's head, and in the darkness of Rat's Alley someone swore and spat. "Good 'un, sir," Syb whispered diplomatically. Noen had recognized the voice. "Is that you, Dinnile?" "Yes, sir, Some filthy devil just flung a rat at me, sir." Inwardly, Noen damned his luck. The story would be all over the ship by morning, and such stories were bad fordiscipline. Aloud he said, "Officers who leave their posts have to expect such luck, Lieutenant." Or perhaps they were good for discipline after all, or could be made to be. Syb and Su would be the cynosures of the main deck, and he himself shouldn't come off too badly. "I didn't leave my post, sir." Dinnile's brass breastplate gleamed now in the faint light. He spat again and wiped his mouth on his sleeve. "I got 'em." "Got what?" "Fifty-two rowers, sir. You said not to take no more, remember? No use payin' more than's authorized." Noen squinted at the dim column that trailed after Dinnile in the dark. "You got fifty-two in a couple of watches?" "Yes, sir! They come together, sir. They're nomads from the Great Waste." Dinnile halted before his captain and touched his forehead. "There's been a drought there, they say, so it's worse than usual--cattle dyin', and all that. They come to Liavek to keep from starvin', and somebody that saw one of Oeuni's placards sent 'em to us." Noen nodded. It seemed best to nod in the face of Dinnile's enthusiasm. "That's a piece of luck." "For us and them--that's what I told 'em. We'll sail tomorrow with full complement, sir." Noen nodded again. "They're strong enough to pull an oar, you think?" Dinnile was not the most brilliant officer in the fleet, but as a judge of what could be extorted with a rope end, he had no peer. "Give 'em a little food and they'll do fine, sir. They spent their five coppers on ale and apples and such at the Big Tree, sir. And I promised 'em, too, a good feed when we get to the ship." "Right," Noen told him. Anything to keep them from deserting on the way. "We'll go with you." Away from the beetling structures of Rat Alley, there was more light, and Noen counted the recruits as they filed past. Forty-nine, fifty ... he held his breath ... fifty-one, fifty-two. Then the pair of crewmen he had assigned to help Dinnile. Allpresent and accounted for. It was beyond belief, too good to be true. For a dizzy moment he wondered if it were his birthday--could he have forgotten? No. Dinnile's perhaps. No. Or--of course--one of the nomads'. What better luck could the poor devil have than seeing himself and all his friends fed and safe aboard the <i>Windsong</i>? Or what worse? Noen asked one of Dinnile's sailors if there had been fifty-two exactly. "Oh, no, sir. More like to a hundred, sir. The Lieutenant picked out the best, and let them sign." Let them sign! It was a night to remember. &nbsp; <br> Ler Oeuni touched her forehead as he came aboard. Noen touched his own and said, "We'll put off for Minnow Island as soon as Dinnile has the new hands at the oars." "There's a bit of night breeze, sir." "Under oar, Lieutenant, not under sail." Oeuni was sailing officer (and gunnery officer); Dinnile rowing officer. Ordinarily it would be best to spare the rowers as much as possible, but the new hands had to be taught their job, and the sooner the teaching began, the better--tomorrow they might have to ram a pirate. Noen mounted to <i>Windsong's</i> long, lightly built quarterdeck and watched Dinnile shoving the new hands to their places, most to forward oars from which they would be able to watch the trained rowers at the aft oars and would be caught up in the rowing rhythm that was almost like a spell. "See that there's at least one experienced hand at each oar, Dinnile." "Aye, aye, sir." The tone of Dinnile's response managed to imply that the instruction had been unnecessary. "Do they speak Liavekan?" Noen cursed himself for not having found out sooner. "Some do, sir. Some don't." "Then <i>talk</i> to them. They've got to learn, and quickly." "Aye, aye, sir." "Foreigners?" Oeuni ventured to ask. "Nomads from the Great Waste," Noen told her. She would have to deal with them, after all, as they all would. Eventually, she would have to train them to reef and steer. "They're subjects of the Empire, then." Noen shook his head. "They're not Tichenese, if that's what you mean. And whatever they were, they became subjects of Her Magnificence when they signed with us." Dinnile had pushed the last of the nomads into place. Noen cleared his throat. "Listen to me, you new hands! I'm Tev Noen, your captain. Call me Captain Noen. This is Ler Oeuni, our first mate. Call her Lieutenant Oeuni. Lieutenant Beddil Dinnile signed you--you should know him already, and the petty officers you'll learn soon enough. You'll be treated firmly on this ship, but you'll be treated fairly. Do your best, and you'll have no cause to worry. "You've been promised a good dinner tonight, and you're going to get it. There are navy kitchens at the base on Minnow Island, and they'll have hot food for you." It was probably better not to tell them they would not be permitted to leave the ship, that the food would be carried on board. "When I give the order 'out oars,' watch the trained hands and do as they do." Noen glanced at Oeuni. "You may cast off, Lieutenant." "Stand by to cast off!" she shouted at the sailors stationed fore and aft. They leaped onto the wharf. "Cast off!" A few moments more and <i>Windsong</i> was under way, her oars rising and falling awkwardly, but more or less together, in a beat as slow as the timesman at the kettledrums could make it. A fresh wind touched Noen's cheek as the dark wharves and warehouses of the waterfront vanished in the night. Little cat's-tongue waves, the hesitant ambassadors of the lions in the Sea of Luck, rocked <i>Windsong</i> as a mother rocks her child. "Not so bad," Oeuni said. Noen answered with a guarded nod. How hard were a nomad's hands? Not as hard as a sailor's, certainly. These men would have blisters tomorrow, if the wind failed, and-- On the main deck, Dinnile's rope end rose and fell. There was a shout that sounded like a curse, and the flash of steel. Dinnile's big fist sent someone reeling over the next oar. Something--a knife, surely--clattered to the deck. Noen called, "Tivlo! Bring that to me." Tivlo was the petty officer in charge of the mainmast. "Dinnile! If he's conscious, put him back to work." Attacking an officer was punishable by death, but Noen had no intention of losing a hand this early. Tivlo handed up the knife, hilt first. Its blade was curved and wickedly double-edged. "We'll have a shakedown as soon as we tie up," Oeuni said. Noen nodded. The cresset burning atop the highest tower of Fin Castle was already in plain view. The nomads would need their knives to cut rope and do a thousand other tasks. But they would need nothing more, and there was no telling...</p><h2>The Sleep Lady�&#39;s Good Night, Sleep Tight: Gentle Proven Solutions to Help Your Child Sleep Well and Wake Up Happy</h2><p>Kim West, LCSW-C, known to her clients as The Sleep Lady�, has developed an alternative and effective approach to helping children learn to gently put themselves to sleep without letting them &#x201c;cry it out&#x201d;&#x2014;an option that is not comfortable for many parents.<p>Essential reading for any tired parent, or any expectant parent who wants to avoid the pitfalls of sleeplessness, <i>Good Night, Sleep Tight</i> offers a practical, easy-to-follow remedy that will work for all families in need of nights of peaceful slumber!</p><p>New material and updates include:</p><p>� New research on pacifiers and SIDS, the impact of sleep deprivation on postpartum depression<br> � Additional guidance on feeding your baby and toddler and how feeding relates to sleep<br> � What you can do to improve your baby&#x2019;s sleep habits before 6 months<br> � New information on breastfeeding<br> � Preparing a sibling for the birth of a baby<br> � Creating a secure attachment with your baby while instilling healthy sleep habits for the family<br> � How to read your baby&#x2019;s cries</p></p><p><b>Kim West, LCSW-C</b>, is the mother of two and a licensed practicing child and family therapist for more than sixteen years.

Callahan, whose popular <i>Good House Book</i> helped environmentally-minded readers create an earth-friendly home, have returned with a photo-packed, amazingly complete, start-to-finish guide to "green" housebuilding.<br><br>This absolutely groundbreaking manual doesn't just talk about eco-friendly building techniques, but actually <i>shows</i> every step! More than 1,200 close-up photographs, along with in-depth descriptions, follow the real construction of an alternative house from site selection to the addition of final-touch interior details. Co-authors Clarke Snell and Timothy Callahan (a professional builder and contractor) provide thorough discussions of the fundamental concepts of construction, substitutes for conventional approaches, and planning a home that's not only comfortable and beautiful, but environmentally responsible. Then, they roll up their sleeves and get to work assembling a guest house that incorporates four different alternative building methods: straw bale, cob, cordwood, and modified stick frame. The images show every move: how the site is cleared, the basic structure put together, the cob wall sculpted, the bales and cordwood stacked, a living roof created, and more. Most important, the manual conveys real-world challenges and processes, and offers dozens of sidebars with invaluable advice. It's head and shoulders above all others in the field.</p><p>Clarke Snell is an expert in the field of green building and self-sufficiency. Author of The Good House Book (Lark, 2004), he lives in the mountains of Western North Carolina with his wife in a partially-bermed, passive-solar house in a small intentional community they helped create.<br><br>Tim Callahan is a practicing general contractor. An experienced timber-frame builder, Tim is currently focused on residential projects of unique character.<br>This large, generously illustrated manual is an excellent primer on owner-designed and site-inspired building. Snell, who wrote the eco-friendly <i>The Good House Book</i>, and Callahan, a more conventional but highly experienced builder and contractor, take readers step-by-step through the creation of a charming little guesthouse, demonstrating a variety of "green" techniques along the way. They start with an introduction to building fundamentals and how alternative materials can provide the necessities of housing: structure, climate-control and separation from as well as connection to the outer world. Next comes a mini-course in design. But the bulk of the book is hands-on: the nuts-and-bolts of siting; foundations; flooring; living (plant-covered) roofs; and cob, cordwood, straw-bale and modified stick frame walls&#x2014;although the book's minimal treatment of electricity and plumbing, and how to integrate them with unfamiliar materials like cob or straw-bale, disappoints. Snell's tendency to decry the sins of modern architectural practice can become exasperating, but doesn't diminish the value of his extensive experience-derived knowledge; and the grace and beauty of the authors' building project, featuring Callahan's fine finish work, is inspiring. The abundance of color photos detailing the construction process, supplemented by examples from indigenous buildings around the world, is particularly helpful. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Far from making the world safe for democracy, America&#x2019;s entry into the war opened the door to murderous tyrants and Communist rulers. No other president has had a hand&#x2014;however unintentional&#x2014;in so much destruction. That&#x2019;s why, Powell declares, &#x201c;Wilson surely ranks as the worst president in American history.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Wilson&#x2019;s War</i> reveals the horrifying consequences of our twenty-eighth president&#x2019;s fateful decision to enter the fray in Europe. It led to millions of additional casualties in a war that had ground to a stalemate. And even more disturbing were the long-term consequences&#x2014;consequences that played out well after Wilson&#x2019;s death. Powell convincingly demonstrates that America&#x2019;s armed forces enabled the Allies to win a decisive victory they would not otherwise have won&#x2014;thus enabling them to impose the draconian surrender terms on Germany that paved the way for Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s rise to power. <br><br>Powell also shows how Wilson&#x2019;s naivet� and poor strategy allowed the Bolsheviks to seize power in Russia. Given a boost by Woodrow Wilson, Lenin embarked on a reign of terror that continued under Joseph Stalin. The result of Wilson&#x2019;s blunder was seventy years of Soviet Communism, during which time the Communist government murdered some sixty million people.<br><br>Just as Powell&#x2019;s <i>FDR&#x2019;s Folly</i> exploded the myths about Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal, <i>Wilson&#x2019;s War</i> destroys the conventional image of Woodrow Wilson as a great &#x201c;progressive&#x201d; who showed how the United States can do good by intervening in the affairs of other nations.

The last general European war had concluded a century earlier, in 1815, when the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated and banished to a shabby house on St. Helena, a British-controlled island in the South Atlantic Ocean, about 1,140 miles west of South Africa.<br><br>The Napoleonic Wars helped convince several generations that war was an evil to be avoided. The dapper Corsican Napoleon had emerged as a military strongman amid the wreckage of the French Revolution. In 1799 and 1800 he led successful French military campaigns against Austro-Hungarian armies in Italy and Germany. In 1799 he seized power in a coup. He declared himself to be consul for life. He resolved to conquer Egypt, gain French territory in the Caribbean, and extend his influence throughout the Mediterranean. He annexed Piedmont and forced a more congenial government on the Swiss Confederation.<br><br>Napoleon established the first modern police state. He tapped Joseph Fouche, who had been educated for the clergy but had never taken his vows as a priest, to organize a secret police force. As a Jacobin during the French Revolution, Fouche had organized mass shootings. He developed Napoleon's spy network throughout Europe, and he arranged to have adversaries abducted and shot.<br><br>The nationalist fury that swept through Germany during the mid-twentieth century, providing political support for Hitler, began to develop after Napoleon humiliated the German-speaking people. He defeated the Austrian army at Austerlitz (1805) and crushed the Prussians at Jena (1806). Prussian generals turned out to be cowards, and the Prussian army quickly disintegrated. Prussia had built a system of forts that were expected to provide a sturdy defense, but they generally surrendered without much resistance. Napoleon ordered that German-speaking states, including Bavaria, Wurttemberg, Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, Nassau, and Berg, be combined to form the Confederation du Rhin--the Confederation of the Rhine. The French had already, in 1792, annexed territories west of the Rhine, notably Cologne and Mainz.<br><br>Napoleon dismissed corrupt old tyrants, an action that local people surely appreciated, but in many cases they were replaced by Napoleon's relatives, who became corrupt new tyrants. He imposed his Code Napoleon on conquered territories. Based on Roman law and some 14,000 decrees issued during the French Revolution, this was a simplified civil law code providing uniform rules for people to live by. Napoleon abolished the hodgepodge of feudal laws and customs. As historian J. M. Thompson noted, "The Code Napoleon contained less than 120,000 words and could be carried in the pocket."<br><br>Some 100,000 of Napoleon's troops occupied Prussia at the nation's expense. In 1807 he signed the Treaty of Tilsit with Russia, stripping Prussia of German-speaking provinces north and west of the lower Elbe River, and Polish provinces to the east.Altogether, Prussian territory was cut from 89,120 square miles to 46,032. Napoleon demanded that the Prussian government pay him 140 million francs. This amounted to a huge tax that devastated the economy. Making things worse was Napoleon's "Continental System," aimed at harming Britain by closing Europe's ports. The Continental System meant that Prussia couldn't earn its accustomed revenues from grain exports.<br><br>When Napoleon was paid off, he withdrew his forces from Prussia and turned his attention elsewhere, and the Prussian king pondered how his state might regain its place in the world. He was persuaded to name Karl vom Stein as chief minister. Stein was fascinated by Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, who had urged dramatic reforms on the last French king to possess absolute power, Louis XVI. Stein persuaded Frederick William III to issue the Edict of Emancipation, in October 1807, which abolished feudal privileges and restrictions on the sale of land. In other words, he opened up property markets, erasing legal distinctions among aristocrats, merchants, or peasants. Stein also extended civil rights to Jews. He was convinced these reforms would unleash the energies of the people.<br><br>Prussia also reformed what was left of its army: ineffective officers were dismissed; junior officers were promoted on merit; army policies were adopted to improve efficiency. The long process of rebuilding got under way. The consequences of the Napoleonic Wars were devastating as they played out decades later in Prussia and throughout Europe.<br><br>The Napoleonic Wars themselves were bad enough. Historian Paul Johnson observed that the wars "set back the economic life of much of Europe for a generation. They made men behave like beasts, and worse. The battles were bigger and much more bloody. The armies of the old regimes were of long-service professional veterans, often lifers, obsessed with uniforms, pipe clay, polished brass, and their elaborate drill&#x2014;the kings could not bear to lose them. Bonaparte cut off the pigtails, ended the powdered hair, supplied mass-produced uniforms and spent the lives of his young, conscripted recruits as though they were loose change. His insistence that they live off the land did not work in subsistence economies like Spain and Russia, where if the soldiers stole, the peasants starved. . . . Throughout Europe, the standards of human conduct declined as men and women, and their growing children, learned to live brutally."<br><br>The savagery was shocking. Reporting on Napoleon's campaign in Spain, historian Antonina Vallentin wrote: "French corpses piled up in the mountain ravines. . . . Drunk with fury against the servants of Christ who preached hatred, the French soldiers sacked the churches, carried away the objects of veneration, profaned the House. The village priests slaughtered the French who sought refuge among them. Farms were left burning like torches when the French had passed by. The wounded and the ill were murdered as they were being taken from one place to another. The roads were strewn with denuded corpses; the trees were weighed down with the bodies of men hanged; blind hate was loosed against hate, a nameless terror roamed the deserted countryside, death came slowly through the most frightful mutilations."<br><br>Napoleon's worst horrors occurred during the Russian campaign. In the spring of 1812, he assembled some 600,000 soldiers&#x2014;his "Grand Army" including Prussians, Austrians, and Italians. They crossed the Niemen River, which flows from western Russia into the Baltic, and headed east in a front some 300 miles wide. Napoleon wanted a decisive battle that would force Czar Alexander I to become his subject, but the czar's forces harassed Napoleon's soldiers in skirmishes, then withdrew into the interior of the country, destroying fields, towns, and cities as they went, denying Napoleon the opportunity to replenish his supplies. The farther Napoleon advanced, the farther Russian forces withdrew, and the more devastation Napoleon encountered. His forces entered Smolensk, only to find it consumed by flames.<br><br>According to historian Christopher Herold, "The progress of his carriage along a road choked with limping cripples, stretchers, and ambulances set him into a somber mood. In Smolensk he passed carts loaded with amputated limbs. In the hospitals the surgeons ran out of dressings and used paper and birch bark fibers as substitutes; many of those who survived surgery died of starvation, for the supply service had virtually broken down. In addition to the battle casualties, hundreds of men fell victim to the Russian secret weapon, vodka, dying by the roadside from a combination of raw spirits and exposure. Such, it must be emphasized, was the condition of the Grand Army not during its tragic retreat but during its victorious advance."<br><br>Although Napoleon's supply lines were stretched to the limit, he could see that his forces would disintegrate if they spent the winter in Smolensk. He decided they must continue on to Moscow. The September 1812 Battle of Borodino was among the few engagements&#x2014;there were some 30,000 French casualties and 45,000 Russian casualties. On September 14, Napoleon reached the outskirts of Moscow with about 90,000 soldiers. He stopped advancing and waited for a Russian delegation to surrender, but they never came. By the time Napoleon actually entered Moscow, it was burning.<br><br>French soldiers reveled in the riches they looted from the city, but they needed food. Foraging in the countryside yielded less and less. Their boots had worn out, and they had nothing else to wear. They didn't have winter clothing when the weather turned bitter cold in October. By then, Napoleon recognized that he had to retreat, and he headed for Smolensk. As his soldiers retreated, they were attacked by Cossack fighters and peasant guerrillas. One of Napoleon's generals, Philippe-Paul Segur, recalled that "the earth was littered with battered helmets and breastplates, broken drums, fragments of weapons, shreds of uniforms, and blood-stained flags. Lying amidst this desolation were half-devoured corpses."<br><br>The first heavy snowfall was on November 6. Segur wrote, "Objects changed their shape; we walked without knowing where we were or what lay ahead, and anything became an obstacle. . . . Yet the poor wretches [Napoleon's soldiers] dragged themselves along, shivering, with chattering teeth, until the snow packed under the soles of their boots, a bit of debris, a branch, or the body of a fallen comrade tripped them and threw them down. Then their moans for help went unheeded. The snow soon covered them up and only low white mounds showed where they lay." Cossack fighters and peasant guerrillas massacred the stragglers, and Russian armies joined the rout. When Napoleon's Grand Army had been reduced to about 9,000, he went ahead to rais...</p><h2>Heartfelt Discipline</h2><p>Trying to understand what God really says about childhood discipline can be like putting together a puzzle, but the pieces just don't all seem to fit. Since the early 1970s, conservative Christians have rejected the permissive "hands off" discipline of the 1950s, and adopted a strict "hands on" discipline taught by many well-known Christian parenting authorities. That view, though, is based primarily on a faulty exegesis of four verses in Proverbs. Scripture, instead, teaches a relational "hands around" discipline that bears no resemblance to what many have taught for forty years. In <i>Heartfelt Discipline</i>, Clay Clarkson examines all the relevant verses for childhood discipline to show how they have too often been either misunderstood or misapplied to young children, and wrongly turned into a formula for parenting success that has no biblical support. If you have young children and are beginning to try to solve the discipline puzzle for your family, start with this book. It is a fresh and fully biblical perspective on childhood discipline that will change the way you think about your children. You'll see how all the biblical pieces fit together and make sense, and put you on the path to your child's heart. <br><br> <i>From the back cover</i>: Childhood discipline is your responsibility. If you're a parent, your children need you to discipline them. There's no debate about that in Scripture. They, and God, are expecting you to bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. But there is one thing open to debate...how to discipline your children. What does the Bible really say? Is there a divinely-designed method, a promise of parental success? Or is there a better way? There's no formula for childhood discipline. No laws, no rules. God has provided a way that is better. It is the way of life, the biblical picture of the path we walk with God. It's all about faith, relationship, Spirit, and heart. As a parent, you're already on that path of life with your children. You can lead them with three key principles of discipline:<br><br> <b>Direction</b> -- Guiding and showing them how to walk the path with God.<br> <b>Correction</b> -- Getting them back on the path when sin leads them off of it.<br> <b>Protection</b> -- Guarding them from temptations that could draw them away.<br><br> In <i>Heartfelt Discipline</i> Clay Clarkson helps you understand what the Bible really says about childhood discipline. Drawing on twenty-eight years of parenting and his personal study of the Bible, Clay fully fleshes out God's way of path of life parenting. It will change how you think about your responsibility to discipline your children. It will put you on the path to your child's heart.</p><p>Christian parents are sure of one thing?they must discipline their children. Ask them to define <i>discipline,</i> however, and you will find little agreement. Many parenting experts support a strict, ?hands-on? approach?usually in the form of spankings. Other believers think a permissive, ?hands-off? is the best way to demonstrate love. Caught between these extremes, well-meaning parents feel torn and even more confused about what the Bible really says on the subject. <br><br>Is there a better way to lovingly train and guide our kids? <i>Yes,</i> says author Clay Clarkson, and in <i>Heartfelt Discipline </i>he offers a long-awaited, biblical discipline solution that is caring and effective?one that leaves parents feeling confident and guiltless, not saddened or conflicted. <br><br>At last, here is a faith-directed approach to discipline that spares the rod but <i>doesn?t </i>spoil the children. Through biblical advice, answers to commonly asked questions, and positive encouragement, Clay Clarkson presents a new, biblical model of discipline?one that allows parents to embrace a completely new way of thinking about childhood discipline, renew their relationships with their children, and transform the dynamics of their family life.Clay Clarkson is the father of four wholehearted children, all grown and following God on their own paths of life. He and Sally started Whole Heart Ministries in 1994 to help Christian parents raise their children for Christ. He is the author <i>Educating the WholeHearted Child</i> and <i>Our 24 Family Ways</i>, an editor, writes online and for publication, and directs the ministry. Clay earned an MDiv from Denver Seminary, but still studies in the graduate school of parenting.

A true master tells all, revealing the strange secret of growing young and mad; opening a Witch Door that links two intolerant centuries; joining an ancient couple in their wild assassination games; celebrating life and dreams in the unique voice that has favored him across six decades and has enchanted millions of readers the world over.</p><p><p>In a career spanning more than seventy years, Ray Bradbury, who died on June 5, 2011 at the age of 91, inspired generations of readers to dream, think, and create. A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to fifty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, teleplays, and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time. His groundbreaking works include <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, <em>The Martian Chronicles</em>, <em>The Illustrated Man</em>, <em>Dandelion Wine</em>, and <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em>. He wrote the screen play for John Huston's classic film adaptation of <em>Moby Dick</em>, and was nominated for an Academy Award. He adapted sixty-five of his stories for television's <em>The Ray Bradbury Theater</em>, and won an Emmy for his teleplay of <em>The Halloween Tree</em>. He was the recipient of the 2000 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2004 National Medal of Arts, and the 2007 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, among many honors.</p><p>Throughout his life, Bradbury liked to recount the story of meeting a carnival magician, Mr. Electrico, in 1932. At the end of his performance Electrico reached out to the twelve-year-old Bradbury, touched the boy with his sword, and commanded, "Live forever!" Bradbury later said, "I decided that was the greatest idea I had ever heard. I started writing every day. I never stopped."</p>A collection of 21 tales from the Grandfather fantasist--none of which have appeared in book form before, though the publishers disdain to tell us where they have appeared before, if they have, or when they were written. Also, the fantasy elements are mostly small or absent altogether; and--a Bradbury trademark--many of the stories lean heavily on nostalgia, or come drenched in sentiment: imaginary children, ghosts, fairgrounds and magic shows, dead dogs, mad inventors, mysterious doorways, books, graveyards, adolescence. Other tales offer startling ideas that unfortunately are obscured or damaged by poor or eccentric dramatizations: a U-boat captain turned psychoanalyst; the world's architects forming a grand historical conspiracy to build cities where they'll inevitably be destroyed, thus ensuring an endless supply of work; a Victorian pastiche about a vampire predator; and a Dorian Gray variant. Finally, still sentimental but closer to vintage Bradbury, are ``Last Rites,'' wherein a time traveler enters the past to reassure authors neglected during their own lifetimes (Melville, Poe, Wilde) that posterity will celebrate their work; and ``The Very Gentle Murders,'' a funny, edgy, ironic tale of a cackling octogenarian couple dodderingly scheming to murder each other. So-so material for the most part; fans hoping for another Martian Chronicles or October Country face certain disappointment.

After risking his life and a fresh round of civil war to overthrow the Committee of Public Safety's reign of terror and restore the Republic of Haven's ancient Constitution, an interstellar war was the last thing he wanted. <br> Baron High Ridge didn't. The Prime Minister of Manticore was perfectly happy with the war he had. No one was shooting anyone else at the moment, and as long as he could spin out negotiations on the formal treaty of peace, his government could continue to milk all those "hostilities only" tax measures for their own partisan projects. <br> His Imperial Majesty Gustav didn't. Now that the fighting between the Star Kingdom and the Havenites had ended, the Andermani Emperor had his own plans for Silesia, and he was confident he could achieve them without a war of his own. <br> Protector Benjamin didn't. His people had made too deep a commitment to the Manticoran Alliance, in blood as well as treasure, for him to want to risk seeing it all thrown away. <br> And Honor Harrington certainly didn't. The "Salamander" had seen the inside of too many furnaces already, knew too much about how much war cost. <br> Unfortunately, what they wanted didn't matter....</p><p>David Weber's Honor Harrington series continues in this 10th novel, which picks up the action several years after the previous volume, <i>Ashes of Victory</i>. With a ceasefire in place with the Peeps, the new government of the Star Kingdom ignores the wishes of Queen Elizabeth and then threatens the very fabric of the Manticore Alliance against the People's Republic of Haven. We find Honor in the role of a senior political advisor, performing with her usual flair and �lan. <p> With <i>War of Honor</i> coming in at over 800 pages, Weber has room to expand subplots and secondary characters and bring to the reader a feeling of depth and completeness seldom seen in science fiction novels. Favorite characters from past stories return, many of them growing in stature from unimportant secondary characters to major players in the "Honorverse." Weber serves up trouble in Silesia, the excitement of a new wormhole junction, scheming in Manticorian politics, strange events deep in Peep territory, and plenty of exploding spaceships--and, as publisher Jim Baen says, "We like exploding spaceships." <i>--Ron Peterson</i></p>Undeniably the science fiction phenomenon of the decade, New York Times bestselling author David Weber is often compared to C.S. Forester (the celebrated creator of Captain Horatio Hornblower) and is the recipient of critical praise worthy of Heinlein or Asimov. His hordes of voracious fans clamor for more and more Weber. Fortunately for them, Weber keeps steadily producing book after book. His novels range from epic fantasy (Oath of Swords, The War God&#39;s Own) to breathtaking space opera (Path of the Fury, The Armageddon Inheritance) to military science fiction with in-depth characterization (the celebrated and awesomely popular Honor Harrington series, Ashes of Victory being the last installment). Reviewers call Weber &#34;highly entertaining&#34; (Booklist), &#34;outstanding . . . superb . . . excellent&#34; (Wilson Library Bulletin), &#34;remarkable&#34; (Kliatt), &#34;the best&#34; (Dragon), &#34;worth shouting about&#34; (Philadelphia Weekly Press), &#34;great&#34; (Locus), and &#34;the best writer around today&#34; (FosFax).

His return after nearly two decades not only represents a police investigation, but a voyage into his own troubled past. As Fin reconnects with the places and people of his tortured childhood, he feels the island once again asserting its grip on his psyche.

May lives and writes in France.<br>*Starred Review* Scottish novelist May (whose series include the Enzo Files, starring a Scottish forensic scientist working in France) starts a projected trilogy, again with a Scottish sleuth, with a shotgun blast of a debut. Two bodies are found hanging from trees: one in Edinburgh, the other on the Isle of Lewis, the most northerly isle in the Outer Hebrides. Edinburgh cop Fin Macleod, originally from Lewis, is assigned to the case for no more reason than that he speaks Gaelic. Two narratives vie with each other. One involves Macleod&#x2019;s struggles with confronting people whom he left behind years ago. The other, which eventually informs the first, is Macleod&#x2019;s first-person memories of his life on the island. The reader knows that Macleod, against all odds, overcame poverty and bad schooling to win a spot at the University of Glasgow and that he threw it all away in his sophomore year and became a cop, a decision he&#x2019;s regretted ever since. The two narratives are brilliantly executed until they converge in an absolute stunner of an ending. The isolation and desolation of Lewis is an apt metaphor for Macleod. For once in crime fiction, a detective confronting demons from his past is not merely a stock plot device. May gives it an urgency that, by novel&#x2019;s end, makes perfect sense. A gripping plot, pitch-perfect characterization, and an appropriately bleak setting drive this outstanding series debut. --Connie Fletcher</p><h2>To Hell on a Fast Horse: Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett, and the Epic Chase to Justice in the Old West</h2><p><p>&#x201c;So richly detailed, you can almost smell the gunsmoke and the sweat of the saddles. &#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x2014;Hampton Sides, <em>New York Times </em>bestselling<em> </em>author of <em>Ghost Soldiers</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No outlaw typifies America&#x2019;s mythic Wild West more than Billy the Kid. <em>To Hell on a Fast Horse </em>by Mark Lee Gardner is the riveting true tale of Sheriff Pat Garrett&#x2019;s thrilling, break-neck chase in pursuit of the notorious bandit.

Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and Ulysses S. Grant's Army of the Potomac clashed in the Virginia countryside--first in the battle of the Wilderness, where the Federal army sustained greater losses than at Chancellorsville, and then further south in the vicinity of Spotsylvania Courthouse, where Grant sought to cut Lee's troops off from the Confederate capital of Richmond.<br><br>This is the first book-length examination of the pivotal Spotsylvania campaign of 7-21 May. Drawing on extensive research in manuscript collections across the country and an exhaustive reading of the available literature, William Matter sets the strategic stage for the campaign before turning to a detailed description of tactical movements. He offers abundant fresh material on race from the Wilderness to Spotsylvania, the role of Federal and Confederate calvary, Emory Upton's brilliantly conceived Union assault on 10 May, and the bitter clash on 19 May at the Harris farm. Throughout the book, Matter assesses each side's successes, failures, and lost opportunities and sketches portraits of the principal commanders.<br><br>The centerpiece of the narrative is a meticulous and dramatic treatment of the horrific encounter in the salient that formed the Confederate center on 12 May. There the campaign reached its crisis, as soldiers waged perhaps the longest and most desperate fight of the entire war for possession of the Bloody Angle--a fight so savage that trees were literally shot to pieces by musket fire. Matter's sure command of a mass of often-conflicting testimony enables him to present by far the clearest account to date of this immensely complex phase of the battle.<br><br>Rigorously researched, effectively presented, and well supported by maps, this book is a model tactical study that accords long overdue attention to the Spotsylvania campaign. It will quickly take its place in the front rank of military studies of the Civil War.<br><br></p><p>"Weaves massive scholarship into a superb narrative that finally makes clear, for the first time, the critical events at Spotsylvania 125 years ago."--Robert K.

This brilliant new book is the first in forty years to describe the whole period, from the last days of the &#x201c;Sun King&#x201d; to the wars of Napoleon. In a groundbreaking work of scholarship, Colin Jones argues that, contrary to popular belief, the house of Bourbon&#x2019;s downfall was hardly a foregone conclusion. Producing an illuminating account of a society torn apart from within, he recounts the saga of how a dynamic French society&#x2014;the heart of the Enlightenment&#x2014;fell prey to the debt and humiliation of its wars against&nbsp;Britain.</p><p>Colin Jones is professor of history at the University of Warwick, England.Historian Jones (The Cambridge Illustrated History of France) has written an exhaustive account of 18th-century France, emphasizing political and economic history. He paints a portrait of a nation opposed to Bourbon absolutism throughout the century, not just at the time of the Revolution. Beginning in the waning years of Louis XIV, philosophers, Jansenists, taxpayers and especially the Paris Parlement, which saw itself as the defender of fundamental law, all criticized the Bourbon regime, pointing to its unwise, revenue-draining wars; persecution of religious dissidents; and ruling in a manner unresponsive to the public will. As Jones convincingly points out, the French Enlightenment changed everything, bringing to the fore a concept of "popular opinion" that would lead the French to believe they had a voice in how their nation was governed. Increasingly after 1750, public opinion became a powerful antiabsolutist influence. Jones devotes an excellent chapter to the Encyclopedie, which he says symbolized a crucial change in French culture and politics. Jones also details the intricate politics of the century, explaining how the monarchs' principal ministers attempted to prop up Bourbon authority and revenues. On the Revolution, Jones is first-rate, especially in depicting the bloody factional feuding between the Jacobins and Girondins. He finishes his book with the Directory and the 1799 coup of Napoleon Bonaparte. This is an outstanding book for academics and students looking for a one-volume overview of the century, but perhaps too dense for the general readers other than those devoted to French history.

Now 60, English-born and American by adoption; all atheist and partly Jewish; bohemian (even listing "drinking" along with "disputation" as "hobbies" in <i>Who's Who</i>), he has held to a consistent thread of principle whether opposing war in Vietnam or supporting intervention in Iraq. As a foreign correspondent in some of the world's nastiest places, a lecturer and teacher and an esteemed literary critic, Hitchens manifests a style that is at once ironic, witty, and tough-minded. A legendary bon vivant with an unquenchable thirst for literature, he has sometimes ridiculed those who claim that the personal is political, though he has often seemed to illustrate that very idea. Readers will find that his own many opposites attract, as do his many sketches of friendship and ex-friendship, from Martin Amis to Noam Chomsky. Condemned to be able to see both sides of any argument, Christopher Hitchens has contradictions that contain their own multitudes.</p><p><p>CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS, a contributing editor to <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Slate</i>, and <i>The Atlantic</i>, authored numerous books, including works on Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, and George Orwell. He was also the author of the international bestsellers <b>god Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything</b> and <b>Hitch-22: A Memoir</b>. He died in December 2011.</p><b>Yvonne</b><br>There is always a moment in childhood when the door opens and lets the future in . . .<br>&#x2014; Graham Greene: <i>The Power and the Glory</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Something I owe to the soil that grew &#x2014;<br>More to the life that fed &#x2014;<br>But most to <i>Allah </i>who gave me two<br>Separate sides to my head.<br>&#x2014; Rudyard Kipling: <i>Kim </i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I OF COURSE do not believe that it is &#x201c;Allah&#x201d; who determines these things. (Salman Rushdie, commenting on my book <i>god Is Not Great</i>, remarked rather mordantly that the chief problem with its title was a lack of economy: that it was in other words exactly one word too long.)<br>&nbsp;<br>But whatever one&#x2019;s ontology may be, it will always seem tempting to believe that everything must have a first cause or, if nothing quite as grand as that, at the very least a definite beginning. And on that point I have no vagueness or indecision. I do know a little of how I came to be in two minds. And <i>this </i>is how it begins with me:<br>&nbsp;<br>I am standing on a ferry-boat that is crossing a lovely harbor. I have since learned many versions and variations of the word &#x201c;blue,&#x201d; but let&#x2019;s say that a brilliant if slightly harsh sunshine illuminates a cerulean sky-vault and an azure sea and also limns the way in which these two textures collide and reflect. The resulting tinge of green is in lambent contrast with the darker vegetation on the hillsides and makes an almost blinding combination when, allied with those discrepant yet melding blues, it hits the white buildings that reach down to the edge of the water. As a flash of drama and beauty and seascape and landscape, it&#x2019;s as good an inaugural memory as one could wish.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since this little voyage is occurring in about 1952 and I have been born in 1949, I have no means of appreciating that this is the Grand Harbor at Valletta, the capital of the tiny island-state of Malta and one of the finest Baroque and Renaissance cities of Europe. A jewel set in the sea between Sicily and Libya, it has been for centuries a place of the two-edged sword between the Christian and Muslim worlds. Its population is so overwhelmingly Roman Catholic that there are, within the walled city, a great plethora of ornate churches, the cathedral being decorated by the murals of Caravaggio himself, that seductive votary of the higher wickedness. The island withstood one of the longest Turkish sieges in the history of &#x201c;Christendom.&#x201d; But the Maltese tongue is a dialect version of the Arabic spoken in the Maghreb and is the only Semitic language to be written in a Latin script. If you happen to attend a Maltese Catholic church during Mass, you will see the priest raising the Communion Host and calling on &#x201c;Allah,&#x201d; because this after all is the local word for &#x201c;god.&#x201d; My first memory, in other words, is of a ragged and jagged, but nonetheless permeable and charming, frontier between two cultures and civilizations.<br>&nbsp;<br>I am, at this stage, far too secure and confident to register anything of the kind. (If I speak a few phrases of Maltese, it is not with a view to becoming bilingual or multicultural but in order to address my priest-ridden nannies and the kitchen maids with their huge broods of children. This was the place where I first learned to see the picture of Catholicism as one of plump shepherds and lean sheep.) * Malta is effectively a British colony &#x2014; its most heroic recent chapter the withstanding of a hysterical aerial bombardment by Hitler and Mussolini &#x2014; and it has remained a solid possession of the Royal Navy, in which my father proudly serves, ever since the Napoleonic Wars. Much more to the immediate point, I am standing on the deck of this vessel in company with my mother, who holds my hand when I desire it and also lets me scamper off to explore if I insist.<br>&nbsp;<br>* Everything about Christianity is contained in the pathetic image of &#x201c;the flock.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, all things being considered, not too shaky a start. I am well-dressed and well-fed, with a full head of hair and a slender waist, and operating in a context of startling architectural and natural beauty, and full of <i>brio </i>and self-confidence, and on a boat in the company of a beautiful woman who loves me.<br>&nbsp;<br>I didn&#x2019;t call her by this name at the time, but &#x201c;Yvonne&#x201d; is the echo with which I most piercingly and yearningly recall her memory to me. After all, it <i>was </i>her name, and it was what her friends called her, and my shell-like ear detected quite early on a difference between this and the various comfortable Nancys and Joans and Ethels and Marjories who &#x2014; sterling types all &#x2014; tended to be the spouses and helpmeets of my father&#x2019;s brother-officers. <i>Yvonne </i>. A bit of class there: a bit of style. A touch or dash of garlic and olive and rosemary to sweeten the good old plain English loaf from which, the fact must be faced, I was also sliced. But more of this when I come to Commander Hitchens. I mustn&#x2019;t pretend to remember more than I really do, but I am very aware that it makes a great difference to have had, in early life, a passionate lady in one&#x2019;s own corner.<br>&nbsp;<br>For example, noticing that I had skipped the baby-talk stage and gone straight to speaking in complete sentences (even if sometimes derivative ones such as, according to family legend, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s all go and have a drink at the club&#x201d;), she sat me down one day and produced an elementary phonetic reading-book, or what used to be known to the humble as &#x201c;a speller.&#x201d; This concerned the tedious adventures of a woodland elf or goblin called Lob-agob (his name helpfully subdivided in this way) but, by the time I was done with it, I was committed for life to having some sort of reading matter within reach at all times, and was always to be ahead of my class in reading-age.<br>&nbsp;<br>By this period, however, our family had left Malta and been posted to the much more austere surroundings of Rosyth, another naval base on the east coast of Scotland. I think Malta may have been a sort of high point for Yvonne: all British people were a cut above the rest in a semicolony and there was that club for cocktails and even the chance of some local &#x201c;help.&#x201d; Not that she longed to wallow in idleness but, having endured a girlhood of scarcity, slump, and then war, she couldn&#x2019;t have minded a bit of color and Mediterranean dash and may well have felt she&#x2019;d earned it. (On our way back from Malta we stopped for a few hours at Nice: her and my first taste of the Riviera. I remember how happy she looked.) The grayness and drabness of &#x201c;married quarters&#x201d; in drizzle-flogged Fifeshire must have hit her quite hard.<br>&nbsp;<br>But she and my father had first been thrown together precisely because of drizzle and austerity, and the grim, grinding war against the Nazis. He, a career Navy man, had been based at Scapa Flow, the huge, cold-water sound in the Orkney Islands which helped establish and maintain British control over the North Sea. She was a volunteer in the Women&#x2019;s Royal Naval Service or, in the parlance of the day, a &#x201c;Wren.&#x201d; (My most cherished photograph of her shows her in uniform.) After a short wartime courtship they had been married in early April 1945, not long before Adolf Hitler had shoved a gun into his own (apparently halitosis-reeking) mouth. One young and eager girl from a broken Jewish home in Liverpool, wed to one man twelve years her senior from a sternly united if somewhat repressed Baptist family in Portsmouth. Wartime was certainly full of such improvised unions, in which probably both at first counted themselves fortunate, but I know for a fact that while my father never stopped considering himself lucky, my mother soon ceased to do so. She also decided, for a reason that I believe I can guess, to engage in the not-so-small deception of not mentioning to anyone in the Hitchens family that she was of Jewish descent.<br>&nbsp;<br>She herself had wanted to &#x201c;pass&#x201d; as English after noticing some slight unpleasantness being visited on my grandmother, who in the 1930s toiled in the millinery business. And Yvonne could pass, too, as a light brunette with hazel-ish eyes and (always to my fancy and imagination) a &#x201c;French&#x201d; aspect. But more to the point, I now feel sure, she did not want either me or my brother to be taxed with <i>die Judenfrage </i>&#x2014; the Jewish question. What I do not know is quite what this concealment or reticence cost her. What I can tell you something about is what it meant for me.<br>&nbsp;<br>The paradox was this: in postwar Britain as in Britain at all other times, there was only one tried and tested form of social mobility. The firstborn son (at least) had to be educated at a private school, with an eventual view to attending a decent university. But school fees were high, and the shoals of class and accent and social position somewhat difficult for first-timers to navigate. Neither of my parents had been to college. One of my earliest coherent memories is of sitting in my pajamas at the top of the stairs, eavesdropping on a domestic argument. It was an easy enough one to follow. Yvonne wanted me to go to a fee-paying school. My father &#x2014; &#x201c;The Commander&#x201d; as we sometimes ironically and affectionately called him &#x2014; made the heavy but obvious objection that it was well beyond our means. Yvonne was having none of this. &#x201c;If there is going to be an upper class in this country,&#x201d; she stated with decision, &#x201c;then Christopher is going to be in it.&#x201d; I may not have the words exactly right &#x2014; could she have said &#x201c;ruling class&#x201d; or &#x201c;Establishment,&#x201d; terms that would then have been opaque to me? &#x2014; but the purport was very clear. And, from my hidden seat in the gallery, I silently applauded. Thus a further paradox discloses itself: my mother was much less British than my father but wanted above all for me to be an English gentleman. (You, dear reader, be the judge of how well <i>that </i>worked out.) And, though she wanted to keep me near, she needed to argue hotly for my sake that I be sent away.<br>&nbsp;<br>I registered this contradiction very acutely as, alternating between the beams and smiles of maternal encouragement and the hot tears of separation, she escorted me to my boarding school at the age of eight. I shall always be slightly sorry that I didn&#x2019;t make more of an effort to pretend that I was desolated, too. I knew I would miss Yvonne but I suppose by then I&#x2019;d had the essential experience of being loved without ever being spoiled. I was eager to get on with it. And at the school, which I had already visited as a prospective boarder, there could be found a library with shelves that seemed inexhaustible. There was nothing like that at our house, and Yvonne had taught me to love books. The cruelest thing I ever did, at the end of my first term away from home, was to come home for Christmas and address her as &#x201c;Mrs. Hitchens.&#x201d; I shan&#x2019;t forget her shocked face. It was the enforced etiquette to address all females at the school, from masters&#x2019; wives to staff, in this way. But I still suspect myself of having committed a mean little attention-getting subterfuge.<br>&nbsp;<br>This perhaps helps explain the gradual diminution of my store of memory of Yvonne: from the ages of eight to eighteen I was to be away from home for most of the year and the crucial rites of passage, from the pains of sexual maturity to the acquisition of friends, enemies, and an education, took place outside the bonds of family. Nonetheless, I always somehow knew how she was, and could generally guess what I didn&#x2019;t know, or what was to be inferred from between the lines of her weekly letters.<br>&nbsp;<br>My father was a very good man and a worthy and honest and hardworking one, but he bored her, as did much of the remainder of her life. &#x201c;The one unforgivable sin,&#x201d; she used to say, &#x201c;is to be boring.&#x201d; What she wanted was the metropolis, with cocktail parties and theater trips and smart friends and witty conversation, such as she had once had as a young thing in prewar Liverpool, where she&#x2019;d lived near Penny Lane and briefly known people like the madly gay Frank Hauser, later director of the Oxford Playhouse, and been introduced by a boyfriend to the work of the handsome Ulster poet Louis MacNeice, contemporary of Auden and author of <i>Autumn Journal </i>and (her favorite) <i>The Earth Compels </i>. What she got instead was provincial life in a succession of small English towns and villages, first as a Navy wife and then as the wife of a man who, &#x201c;let go&#x201d; by the Navy after a lifetime of service, worked for the rest of his days in bit-part jobs as an accountant or &#x201c;bursar.&#x201d; It is a terrible thing to feel sorry for one&#x2019;s mother or indeed father. And it&#x2019;s an additionally awful thing to feel this and to know the impotence of the adolescent to do anything at all about it. Worse still, perhaps, is the selfish consolation that it isn&#x2019;t really one&#x2019;s job to rear one&#x2019;s parents. Anyway, I knew that Yvonne felt that life was passing her by, and I knew that the money that could have given her the occasional glamorous holiday or trip to town was instead being spent (at her own insistence) on school fees for me and my brother, Peter (who had arrived during our time in Malta), so I resolved at least to work extremely hard and be worthy of the sacrifice.<br>&nbsp;<br>She didn&#x2019;t just sit there while I was away. She tried instead to become a force in the world of fashion. Perhaps answering the call of her milliner forebears, but at any rate determined not to succumb to the prevalent dowdiness of postwar Britain, she was forever involved in schemes for brightening the apparel of her friends and neighbors. &#x201c;One thing I <i>do </i>have,&#x201d; she used to say with a slightly defensive tone, as if she lacked some other qualities, &#x201c;is a bit of good taste.&#x201d; I personally thought she had the other qualities too: on those official holidays when parents would visit my boarding school and many boys almost expired in advance from the sheer dread of embarrassment, Yvonne never did, or wore, anything that I could later be teased about (and this was in the days when women still wore hats). She was invariably the prettiest and brightest of the mothers, and I could always kiss her gladly, right in front of everyone else, without any fear of mushiness, lipstick-stains, or other disasters. In those moments I would have dared anyone to tease me about her, and I was small for my age.<br>&nbsp;<br>However, the dress-shop business didn&#x2019;t go well. If it wasn&#x2019;t for bad luck, in fact, Yvonne would have had no luck at all. With various friends and partners she tried to float a store called Pandora&#x2019;s Box, I remember, and another called Susannah Munday, named for an ancestress of ours on the paternal Hampshire side. These enterprises just didn&#x2019;t fly, and I couldn&#x2019;t think why not except that the local housewives were just too drab and myopic and penny-pinching. I used to love the idea of dropping by as I went shopping, so that she could show me off to her friends and have a general shriek and gossip over some coffee, but I could always tell that business wasn&#x2019;t good. With what a jolt of recognition did I read, years later, V.S. Naipaul&#x2019;s uncanny diagnosis of the situation in <i>The Enigma of Arrival </i>. He was writing about Salisbury, which was close enough to Portsmouth:<br>&nbsp;<br>A shop might be just two or three minutes&#x2019; walk from the market square, but could be off the main shopping track.

Nevertheless, the literature on the life and work of Einstein, extensive as it is, does not provide an adequate account of his religious conception and sentiments. Only fragmentarily known, Einstein's ideas about religion have been often distorted both by atheists and by religious groups eager to claim him as one of their own. But what exactly was Einstein's religious credo? In this fascinating book, the distinguished physicist and philosopher Max Jammer offers an unbiased and well-documented answer to this question.</p><br><p> The book begins with a discussion of Einstein's childhood religious education and the religious atmosphere--or its absence--among his family and friends. It then reconstructs, step by step, the intellectual development that led Einstein to the conceptions of a cosmic religion and an impersonal God, akin to "the God of Spinoza." Jammer explores Einstein's writings and lectures on religion and its role in society, and how far they have been accepted by the general public and by professional theologians like Paul Tillich or Frederick Ferr�. He also analyzes the precise meaning of Einstein's famous dictum "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind," and why this statement can serve as an epitome of Einstein's philosophy of religion.</p><br><p> The last chapter deals with the controversial question of whether Einstein's scientific work, and in particular his theory of relativity, has theologically significant implications, a problem important for those who are interested in the relation between science and religion. Both thought-provoking and engaging, this book aims to introduce readers, without proselytizing, to Einstein's religion.</p></p><p><br><p>"No other work offers as broad an account of Einstein's views on the relationship between science and religion or brings together all of the different facets of the topic in one short, easily accessible account. Einstein and Religion also offers a badly needed critique of some of the many misinterpretations and misuses of Einstein's views. Professor Jammer is a noted scholar, science historian, and philosopher with the credentials to write authoritatively on this subject."<b>--David Cassidy, author of<i>Uncertainty: The Life and Science of Werner Heisenberg</i><br></b><br></p><br><b>Max Jammer</b> is Professor of Physics Emeritus and former Rector at Bar-Ilan University in Israel.

Much more than a children's story, the narrative is also a lesson on the precarious nature of freedom, a luxury too often taken for granted. Heidi almost loses her liberty as she is ripped away from the tranquility of the mountains to tend to a sick cousin in the city. Happily, all's well that ends well, and the reader is left with only warm, fuzzy thoughts. Spryi's story will never grow wearisome--and this is a very appealing edition. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i>6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Combining Old and New : Naturopathy for the 21st Century</h2><p>This book... <p>is highly recommended for those studying to be board certified by the American Naturopathic Medical Certification and Accreditation Board. </p><p>has been adopted as a text book by several naturopathic schools. </p><p>includes works by J.H.
